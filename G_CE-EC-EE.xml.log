<xa>一</xa>
  (1) One; the number one; single (Skt.

something (ekatya). (3) The same; 
singular. A single body; a single type (
ekadhya).

<xa>一三昧</xa>
  One pointed concentration; sama^dhi 
concentration. An abbreviation of 一行三昧.


<xa>一乘</xa>
  'Single vehicle' (eka-ya^na). A term 
<pb n="600"/>
used to indicate the doctrine that there
 is only one teaching, which is the 
expedient means to attract people to the
 Single Buddha vehicle. Since this 
single vehicle teaching is the teaching 
of becoming a Buddha, it is also called 
the 'bodhisattva vehicle' 菩薩乘, the '
Buddha vehicle' 佛乘 and the Great Vehicle
 大乘. The Faxiang 法相 school interprets 
this bodhisattva vehicle of the three 
vehicle 三乘 system as the 'one vehicle' 
or 'buddha vehicle.' According to Kuiji'
s 窺基 explanation, the ekaya^na teaching 
of the Faxiang school has two levels, 攝入
大乘 and 出生大乘. The former is the expedient
 to attract people of undermined nature 
(不定性) to the Single Buddha vehicle. 
Because of the existence of sentient 
beings incapable of Buddhahood, this 
teaching does not fully correspond with 
the meaning of single vehicle. But since
 all members of the audience in the 
Lotus Sutra 法華經 have the potential to 
become Buddha, this teaching is true and
 effective in that situation. The latter
 means that all teachings of Buddha are 
'born' from a single Maha^ya^na teaching
. Kuiji says that this is the teaching 
of the S/ri^ma^la^-su^tra 勝鬘經 and the 
Nirvana Sutra 涅槃經. In Huayan 華嚴 and 
<pb n="601"/>
Tiantai 天台, there is a distinction 
between this one Buddha vehicle and the 
bodhisattva vehicle of the three 
vehicles.

Meanings of All the Names: Great King of
 Tantras) To.481, P.114); 2 fasc. (T 888
.18.536-541), abbr. Tantra of the Secret
 Meanings of the Names 秘密名儀軌, translated
 by Da^napa^la 施護 in 1009 CE. An 
explanatory continuation (akhya^natantra
) of the Tattvasam!graha 真實攝經 (T 882). 
Most of the text comments on the 
significance of various yoga-related 
concepts (the four mudra^s 四印, 
procedures for sama^dhi, etc.) and the 
names of the Tattvasam!graha's 37 
divinities. There is an ongoing polemic 
against conventional ethics and the 
performance of rites, which are seen as 
useless in the pursuit of liberation. 
Instead the text emphasizes radical mind
-based methods, such as seeing lust, 
hatred and delusion (ra^ga, dve/sa, moha
 貪嗔癡) as none other than tatha^gatas -- 
<pb n="612"/>
an approach which is standard for later 
Buddhist esotericism, particularly the 
Guhyasama^ja 秘密集會 (T 885). In this 
connection, there appears an infamous, 
oft-quoted passage which appears to 
advocate killing sentient beings, lying,
 stealing and adultery; Da^napa^la's 
version obfuscates this passage (T 888.
18.538b13-14) and others completely, 
also bowdlerizing several terms 
concerning sexual yoga (eg. lin%ga is "
joiner" 相者; bhaga is "destroyer" 破者). 
However, it is notable that the monk 
Ratna^kara/sa^nti also neuters this 
language in his commentary, the S/ri^
sarvarahasyanibam!dho-rahah!pradi^po-na^
ma (To.2623, P.3450); eg. one should 
kill the idea of sentient beings. For an
 Eng. tr. of this, the sole Indian 
commentary, along with the full text 
from Tib., see Wayman (1984); for an 
early Japanese study of the Tibetan 
version, see Togano^ (1953). (msj14); (

  In Consciousness-only theory, the idea

 that each one of the three natures 三性 
by itself contains the meaning of the

and "principle does not exist." In this,
 there is the middle path's meaning of "
neither existent nor empty."

<xa>一行禪師</xa>
  Yixing Chanshi (683-727). Chinese monk
 of the Tang dynasty, acknowledged as 
one of the eight patriarchs of the 
doctrine 傅授八祖 in Shingon lineages. He 
joined the priesthood after the sudden 
death of his parents in 704, having 
previously distinguished himself in 
Taoist circles. He studied Chan 禪 at 
Mount Son 嵩山 with the seventh patriarch 
of the northern school, Puji 普寂 (631-739
), and studied Vinaya with Huizhen 惠真 (
673-751), a disciple of Hongying 弘景. In 
addition, while on Mount Tendai 天台山 he 
studied mathematics and astronomy, 
complementing his widely-recognised 
expertise in Taoist divination and 
calendrical science. In 716, he became 
the disciple of S/ubha^karasim!h!a 善無畏, 
<pb n="622"/>
subsequently receiving a summons to the 
court of emperor Xuanzong 玄宗. He was 
also initiated into various esoteric 
practices by Vajrabodhi 金剛智 shortly 
after their first meeting in 720. His 
most accomplished work, a huge 
commentary 大日經疏 (T 1796) on the 
Vairocana^bhisam!bodhi 大日經, was 
completed in 725 CE. Yixing is also 
popularly remembered as the inventor of 
the armillary-driven clock.

<xa>一遍</xa>
  Ippen, (1239-1289), Japanese monk, 
considered to be the founder of the Ji 
sect 時宗 of Pure Land 淨土 Buddhism, which 
has its main temple Yugyo^ji 遊行寺 in 
Fujisawa. Ippen was born in present-day 
Ehime prefecture and studied at an early
 age with a disciple of Ho^nen 法然. He 
left the priesthood once to return to 
the secular world, but later reversed 
this decision. After a pilgrimage to 
<pb n="623"/>
Zenko^ji 善光寺 in Nagano prefecture, he 
went to a secluded temple in Ehime, 
where he carried out rigorous religious 
practice, and eventually had an 
experience of intimate unity with Amita^
bha Buddha 阿彌陀佛. He became convinced 
through this experience that no matter 
what one's degree of religious 
preparation, he or she could be reborn 
in the Pure Land by virtue of even one 
recitation of Amita^bha's name. He 
subsequently wandered throughout the 
country, handing out slips of paper to 
people with basic instructions for his 
style of Pure Land practice. He is said 
to have converted thousands. Approaching
 death at the age of 51, he burned all 
of his own writings, and thus none of 
his works survive.

<xa>一闡提</xa>
  (icchantika). A transliteration of the
 Sanskrit term icchantika. Also 
translated into Chinese as duanshangen 斷
<pb n="624"/>
善根 'one who has cut off the good roots' 
and xinbujuzu 信不具足 'lacking in the 
necessary faith.' A person whose roots 
of goodness are cut off and therefore 
cannot be saved. Someone who cannot 
attain enlightenment no matter how 
strenuously they practice. The term 
icchan originally refers to someone who 
is in a continual state of craving. In 
India the term refers to an Epicurean or
 a secularist. In Buddhism it refers to 
someone who lacks the basic causes and 
conditions for becoming a Buddha. The 
theory of the existence of such people 
was taught by the Yogacara school. 
Buddhist schools such as Tiantai 天台, 
Huayan 華嚴 etc., disagreed with this 
theory, teaching that all beings can 
become buddhas. This becomes the source 
of debate in later East Asian Buddhism, 
and is discussed at length in the "
Buddha-nature Treatise" (佛性論).


<xa>一音教</xa>
  Also written 一圓教. The 'one-voice

<xa>三性</xa>
  The three natures. {I} The three 
natures of perception in Yoga^ca^ra: (1)
<pb n="643"/>
 The nature of existence produced from 
attachment to illusory discrimination. 
The mind of mistakenly assigning a real 
essence to those things that are 
produced from causes and conditions and 
have no true essence, and the appearance
 of that mistaken world (parikalpitah-
svabha^va; bianji suoyixing 遍計所執性). (2) 
The nature of existence arising from 
causes and conditions. All existence is 
produced according to cause (paratantra-
svabha^va; 依他起性; yitaqixing) . (3) The 
nature of existence being perfectly 
accomplished; the highest state of 
existence conforming to ultimate reality
 (parinispanna-svabha^va; yuanchengshi 
xing 圓成實性; ).［成唯識論T 1585.31.45c］{II} The
 division of all elemental constructs 
into three moral qualities: (1) That 
which produces goodness 善. (2) That 
which produces evil 惡 and (3) That which
 is neutral 無記, producing neither good 
nor evil. The neutral category is 
further subdivided into two categories 
of impedimentary neutrality 有覆無記 and non
-impedimentary neutrality 無覆無記. The 
afflictions 煩惱 are included in the evil 
category.［俱舍論、 T 1558.29.7b］


<pb n="644"/>
<xa>三性對望</xa>
  In the Faxiang sect 法相宗, the use of 
the three natures 三性 to explain the 
middle path 中道. According to 
Consciousness-only 唯識 theory, all 
dharmas 法 (all existences) are included 
in these three natures. The nature based
 on all-pervading discrimination is the 
dharma expressing the average man's 
deluded attachments. The existence that 
is based on accepting the fact that 
there are regular people is the nature 
of all-pervading discrimination, though 
it is not something that is real. This 
point is called "non being" or "
emptiness." In Consciousness-only 
doctrine, emptiness means non-being, 
which is quite different from emptiness 
as understood in the Prajn~a^pa^ramita^ 
sutras, which understand emptiness to 
mean "that which is ungraspable and 
unattached." The next, in the nature of 
existence established according to 
causal arising, those things which are 
established according to causal arising 
are called "dharmas." This is "
provisional existence" or "phenomena" (
jiayou 假有). It is also called "non-empty
." The nature of complete becoming is 
absolute reality. That is, the essence 
<pb n="645"/>
of existence. This is true existence, 
and therefore the three time divisions 
of the teaching (see sanshijiao 三時教) of 
existence, emptiness and the middle path
, are understood as the middle path of 
going by the three natures, as distinct 
from a one-sided clinging to existence 
and a one-sided clinging to emptiness.


<xa>三惑</xa>
  'Three delusions,'three afflictions.' 
(1) Three kinds of basic defilement: 
craving (tanyu 貪欲), anger (chenhui 嗔恚), 
and ignorance (yuchi 愚癡). These are 
equivalent to the 'three poisons' (sandu
 三毒). (2) In Tiantai teaching 天台宗, the 
three delusions are: delusions arising 
from incorrect views and thoughts (
jiansihuo 見思惑); delusions which hinder 
knowledge and are as numerous as the 
number of grains of sand in the Ganges 
river (chenshahuo 塵沙惑); and delusions 
which hinder knowledge of reality (
wuminghuo 無明惑). The first type of 
delusion is dealt with by followers of 
Hi^naya^na 小乘 as well as Maha^ya^na 大乘. 
The latter two types are destroyed only 
by bodhisattvas.

  "Three period teaching classification.
" The doctrinal division of the 
teachings of S/akyamuni's lifetime into 
three periods. The Faxiang sect's 法相宗 
<pb n="651"/>
explanation establishes the three times 
of the teachings of existence, the 
teaching of emptiness, and the teaching 
of the middle way. (1) The teaching of 
the first period (the period of the 
teaching of existence), says that all 
existence is established due to causes, 
but the elements of this composition are
 truly existent. This is established in 
the a^gama sutras and other Hi^naya^na 
sutras. (2) The teaching of the second 
period, which says that the original 
nature of all things is empty. This is 
also called the "negative" period. This 
is the beginning of "great vehicle" 
teaching, as it is changing from "small 
vehicle" teaching. The prajn~a^pa^ramita
^ sutras are examples of this teaching. 
(3) The teaching of the third period is 
that of true emptiness: the middle way 
is explained affirmatively through such 
sutras as the Avatam!saka and the Sam!
dhinirmocana. This is also called the 
period of the "true great vehicle."

established from the point of view of 
the lack of self nature of elements. 
Thus, this is an explanation from the 
standpoint of emptiness. (1) 相無性

seeing is unreal, e.g., a rope appearing
 like a snake. (2) 生無性shengwuxing .

afflictions 十惑. These are evil view 邪見, 
view of attachment to views 見取見, and 
view of attachment to the precepts 戒禁取見.
 ［二障義 HPC 1.799a］


<xa>三觀</xa>
  (1) three views. Three observations 
taught in the Yingluo benye jing which 
were later elucidated by Chih-i 智顗. 
These are (a) the view of emptiness (
kongguan 空觀), which negates mistaken 
notions of common-sense reality; (b) The
 view of dependent arising which cancels
 extreme attachment to emptiness, and (c
) the middle view (zhongguan 中觀) which 
utilizes either of the above but is not 
attached. (2) The three kinds of 
meditation taught in the Sutra of 
Perfect Enlightenment (圓覺經). These are (
a) /samatha 奢摩他, the form of meditation 
in which the mind is stilled by 
<pb n="668"/>
concentration on an object; (b) sama^
patti 三摩缽提, which is contemplative 
meditation utilizing a Buddhist 
conceptual framework such as dependent 
origination, and (c) dhya^na 禪那 which is
 the practice of non-abiding in either 
of the other two. One might easily draw 
parallels between these three and the 
three in the first part of the 
definition. (cm)


<xa>三角山</xa>

Koyanggun 高陽郡, Korea, famous for its 
Buddhist monasteries.


<xa>三解脫門</xa>
  (1) The three gates of liberation. '
Emptiness liberation,' 'no-aspects 
liberation,' and 'desireless liberation.
' These are three kinds of meditative 
practices. (2) In the Diamond Sutra 金剛經 
these are Emptiness Liberation, 
Adamantine Liberation and Prajn~a^ 
Liberation (T vol. 9, 370a).


<xa>三請</xa>
<pb n="669"/>
  'three requests.' To ask (request) 
three times. In the sutras, the Buddha 
is often implored to teach three times 
before he speaks.


<xa>三論</xa>
  "Three Treatises." An appellation for 
three important /sa^stras which served 
as the foundational texts of a Chinese 
school which would be referred to by the
 same name--the "Three Treatise School 三
論宗." These three texts are the 
Madhyamaka-/sa^stra (Zhong lun 中論) and 
the Dva^da/sanika^ya-/sa^stra (Shiermen 
lun 十二門論) by Na^ga^rjuna 龍樹 and the S/
ata-/sa^stra (Bai lun) 百論 by his 
disciple Aryadeva 提婆, all three of which
 were translated into Chinese by Kuma^
raji^va 鳩摩羅什. The school made 
significant contributions in the area of
 the logic of emptiness. The Madhyamaka-
/sa^stra taught the "eight negations" of
 neither arising nor ceasing 不生不滅 , 
neither eternal nor not eternal 不常不斷, 
neither one nor many 不一不異 and neither 
coming nor going 不來不出. These were used 
to refute all forms of attachment to 
concepts of existence and non-existence,
 and thus the meaning of "middle path" 中
<pb n="670"/>
道 wherein all things are accepted as 
existent, but as lacking in self-nature.
 The Dva^da/sanika^ya-/sa^stra also 
explains the emptiness of all dharmas in
 twelve sections, and the S/ata-/sa^stra
 explains emptiness to refute the 
arguments of non-Buddhist philosophers.
           Kuma^raji^va passed these 
texts on to his students Daosheng 道生, 
Sengzhao 僧肇, and Seng-lang. The last of 
these distinguished the Sanlun school 
from the Satyasiddhi school and can thus
 is sometimes regarded as its actual 
founder. In the 6th century the most 
important representatives of this school
 were Falang and Jizang and under them 
the Sanlun school experienced a major 
upsurge. In the 7th century it was 
brought to Japan by Egwan, a Korean 
student of Jizang. After the appearance 
of the Faxiang 法相 school, the Sanlun 
school decreased in importance.


<xa>三論宗</xa>
  The Sanlun zong, or Three-Treatise 
school. One of the thirteen Chinese 
schools 十三宗 which held influence during 
the formative period of East Asian 
Buddhism, whose most important early 
<pb n="671"/>
representative was Jizang 吉藏. The school
 was named as such because of its 
reliance on three Indian /sa^stras (<_-xa>三論</_-xa>above) which had formed the 
basis for the Indian Ma^dhyamika 中觀派 
doctrine, and therefore the Sanlun 
school is seen as the transmission of Ma
^dhyamika thought in China. Although 
this school would eventually be phased 
out by native Chinese schools such as 
Tiantai 天台 and Huayan 華嚴, its rigorous 
explanations of the logic of emptiness 
and the middle way would be deeply 
assimilated into the doctrines of later 
schools. The Three-treatise school was 
transmitted to Korea as Samnon chong and
 to Japan as the Sanron shu^.


<xa>三論玄義</xa>
  The Profound Meaning of the Three 
Treatises, T 1852.45.1a-15a. By Jizang 吉
藏.


<xa>三諦</xa>
  'The triple truth,' or 'threefold 
truth' The Tiantai term used to explain 
reality in three aspects. (1) kongdi 空諦,
 the 'truth of emptiness', i.e., all 
existences are empty and non-substantial
<pb n="672"/>
 in essence. (2) jiadi 假諦, truth of 
temporariness, i.e., all existences are 
temporary manifestations produced by 
causes and conditions. (3) zhongdi 中諦,' 
truth of the mean', i.e., the absolute 
reality of all existences cannot be 
explained in either negative or 
affirmative terms.


<xa>三諦圓融觀</xa>
  The observation of the real principle 
that allows one to be aware of the 
perfect interfusion of the three truths 
of voidness, temporariness and the mean 
simultaneously.


<xa>三賢</xa>
  'Three degrees of worthies' or 'Three 
Worthies.' (1) In Hi^naya^na Abhidharma,
 these are the three stages of 
wutingxinguan 五停心觀, biexiangnianzhu 別相念住
 and zongxiangnianzhu 總相念住. (2) In the 
Faxiang school, the thirty stages of '
ten abidings', 'ten practices', and 'ten
 dedications of merit.'


<xa>三身</xa>
<pb n="673"/>
           (trika^ya). The 'three bodies
' of the Buddha. (I) Dharmaka^ya, 
sambhogaka^ya, nirma^naka^ya. (1) The 
dharmaka^ya (fashen 法身) is a reference 
to the transcendence of form and 
realization of true thusness; (2) the 
sambhogaka^ya (baoshen 報身) is the buddha
-body that is called 'reward body' or '
body of enjoyment of the merits attained
 as a bodhisattva'; (3) the nirma^naka^
ya (huashen 化身, yingshen 應身) is the body
 manifested in response to the need to 
teach sentient beings. (II) In the 
Faxiang 法相 school the three bodies are 
explained in this way: (1) the Buddha 
body in its self-nature, which is the 
same as the dharma body; (2) the body 
which he receives for enjoyment 
shouyongshen 受用身. Within this is the 
body received for one's own enjoyment in
 the transformation into Great 
Reflecting Wisdom, and the body received
 for the enjoyment of others in the 
transformation into the Wisdom of 
Awareness of Equality. The first one is 
experienced only in the Buddha realm, 
while the second is experienced from the
 first stage of bodhisattva 菩薩 practice 
and above. (3) The transformation body, 
by which he can appear in any form. This
<pb n="674"/>
 body is manifested according to the 
arousal of the wisdom which brings the 
salvation of sentient beings to 
fulfillment.
           From this, Buddha-body theory
 was expanded from three, to four, and 
even up to ten Buddha- bodies. Among 
these, the Maha^ya^na theory of the 
three bodies--the Dharma-body, the 
Reward-body, and the Response-body is 
most common. The Dharma body 法身 is 
considered to be the eternal 
indestructible true principle, the 
Buddha's original body. The Response 
body 應身 is considered to be the Buddha's
 manifest body, but in Maha^ya^na 
Buddhism is regarded as the 
personification body, which from true 
principle manifests according to the 
temperaments and abilities of sentient 
beings in order to save them.
           The Reward body 報身 (baoshen) 
is manifest as a combination of the 
other two, and is therefore not simply 
eternal true principle, nor simply an 
impermanent personality. Rather, it is 
an ideal body possessed by those who 
have awakened to the true principle 
based on meritorious practice. It is the
 living form of the eternal principle, 
<pb n="675"/>
possessing individuality. This is a 
general explanation, and there have been
 a large number of interpretations of 
buddha-body theory offered in the 
history of Buddhism, among which there 
are significant differences.


<xa>三車</xa>
  "Three carts." A metaphor of the Lotus
 Sutra 法華經, from the story of the '
burning house,' which is as follows: 
Some chi^dren are playing in a house, 
unaware that it is on fire. Their father
 induces them to come out by telling 
them that there are three carts outside,
 a goat-drawn cart, a deer-drawn cart 
and an oxcart. When they come out, all 
there really is, is a great white oxcart
. These three carts are metaphors for 
the /sra^vaka 聲聞 vehicle, the 
pratyekabuddha 緣覺 vehicle, and the 
bodhisattva vehicle. This story is told 
in order to explain that although there 
are "lesser vehicle" and "greater 
vehicle" in Buddhist teachings, in the 
final analysis, they are all methods 
aimed at the same enlightenment. The '
burning house' represents the deluded 
world of human beings. The chi^dren are 
<pb n="676"/>
the practitioners of the three vehicles.
 The goat cart represents the /sra^vaka 
vehicle, the deer cart represents the 
pratyekabuddha vehicle, and the ox cart 
represents the bodhisattva vehicle. When
 the chi^dren have been induced to come 
out of the house, the large identical 
white ox carts are prepared outside the 
gate to give to each chi^d. These are 
metaphors for the great compassion of 
the Buddha as he discards his expedient 
means and returns the practitioners to 
the true single Buddha vehicle. Students
 of the Lotus Sutra in China were 
divided into two main groups: one that 
considered the expedient ox cart and the
 (fourth) great white ox cart to be the 
same (therefore positing three vehicles)
. These were mainly the Faxiang 法相 and 
Sanlun 三論 schools. The other group, the 
"four vehicle thinkers" (Hua-yen 華嚴, T'
ien-t'ai) 天台 maintained that the 
expedient ox cart and the great white ox
 cart are different. That is, the three 
vehicle thinkers consider the 
bodhisattva vehicle and the Buddha 
vehicle to be the same, while the four 
vehicle thinkers considered them to be 
different.

da. One of the earliest schools of 
Buddhism that developed in India during 
the century subsequent to the passing 
away of the Buddha. The name of the sect
 implies the meaning of "those 
supporting the teachings of the elders" 
which means that this was a school that 
had conservative tendencies--an attempt 
<pb n="683"/>
to conserve the original teachings of 
the Buddha. They are the longest 
surviving of the original twenty sects 
that comprised what is often referred to
 as Nika^ya Buddhism 部派佛教 as they

Southeast Asian countries such as Sri 
Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia. 
The Therava^da school is known for its 
early conflict with the more liberal 
Maha^sa^m!ghika 大眾部 school, which had 
espoused a revisionist approach to the

whereas the ignorance that functions 
with the sixth consciousness is subject 
to interruptions.) ii. Unique ignorance 
which functions by itself 獨行不共無明, which 
is the name given to the type of 
ignorance which functions with the sixth

<xa>不增不減經</xa>
  The Pu-tseng pu-chien ching; Sutra of 
Neither Increasing nor Decreasing. 
Translated by Bodhiruci in 525. A short 
but influential tatha^gatagarbha text 
that discusses the relationship between 
sentient beings and the dharmaka^ya 法身 (
or dharmadha^tu 法界) as being one of 
equivalence within the medium of the 
tatha^gatagarbha 如來藏. The sermon begins 
with a question by S/a^riputra 舍利弗 as to
 whether the total number of sentient 
beings who transmigrate through the 
three realms and six destinies ever 
increases or decreases. The Buddha 
responds by explaining how views of 
increase and decrease are equivalent to 
the mistaken extremes of eternalism and 
nihi^ism. He then goes into depth 
explaining the nature of the tatha^
gatagarbha in relation to the dharma 
body and sentient beings. The full title
 of the text is 佛說不增不減經. T 668.16.466-
468.


<xa>不壞</xa>

 十回向 of the path of the bodhisattva. 
According to the Yoga^ca^ra 瑜伽行派 school,
 the stage where the bodhisattva sees 
emptiness easily without analyzing 
existence.


<xa>不定</xa>
  Non-determined, indeterminate (aniyata
). (1) One of the six groups of mental 
functions, so named because they arise 
irregularly, and do not have a 
predilection for good or evil. The 
Abhidharma school lists eight of these, 
called the 不定地法. Yoga^ca^ra lists four, 
called the 不定法. (2) One of the two 
categories of transgressions of monks, 
which have the nature that the exact 
type of offense and punishment are not 
clear. (3) Not real, not existent. (4) 
To be mentally unsettled, not correctly 
entered into meditative concentration. (
5) The indeterminate class of sentient 
beings 不定眾.


<xa>不定地法</xa>
  In Abhidharma theory, the 
<pb n="699"/>
indeterminate mental functions, which do
 not have a determinable good or evil 
nature, and do not always act in 
concomitance with the mind in all of its
 states (aniyata^-bhu^mika). These 
include reflection 尋, investigation 伺, 
sleepiness 眠, repentance 惡作, 
covetousness 貪, antipathy 嗔, pride 慢, 
and doubt 疑. Equivalent to this category
 in Yoga^ca^ra are the four 
indeterminate mental functions 四不定.


<xa>不定法</xa>
  The 'undetermined elements' which do 
not necessary arise in all states of 
mind, and therefore have no 
predisposition toward good or evil. In 
the Abhidharma, there are eight mental 
functions in this category, more 
precisely termed as 不定地法. In the Yoga^ca
^ra 瑜伽行派 doctrine there are four of 
these mental functions: remorse (zhuihui
 追悔), drowsiness (shuimian 睡眠), 
investigation (尋), and analysis (伺). 
Also called the "four indeterminates" 四不
定.

mental function' elements in the 
doctrine of the Yoga^ca^ra 瑜伽行派 school. 
The mental function of not depriving 
others and not harming others. In 
Consciousness-only, it is a 
provisionally named function, arising 
dependent upon the mental function of no
-anger (無嗔).


<xa>不思議</xa>
  (1) inconceivable. That which is 
beyond contemplation or 
conceptualization. Beyond linguistic 
expression (acintya, atarkika). (2) 'No-

grasping mental functions (gra^haka-
citta-abha^va). (3) That which cannot be
 apprehended or thought about (acintya-
prabha^vata^).


<xa>不思議薰</xa>
  'inconceivable permeation.' The 
permeation of the pure self-essence of 
the mind of true thusness by ignorance

 function' dharmas listed in the 
Abhidharma-ko/sa-bha^sya 俱舍論; one of the
 'good mental function' elements in the 
doctrine of the Yoga^ca^ra 瑜伽行派. The 
mental function of resisting evil 
existences and cultivating good ones. In
 Yoga^ca^ra doctrine, it is considered 
as a provisional element rather than a 
real one.

<xa>不空金剛</xa>
  Amoghavajra (705-774). A prolific 
translator who became one of the most 
politically powerful Buddhist monks in 
Chinese history, acknowledged as one of 
the eight patriarchs of the doctrine 傅授八
祖 in Shingon lineages. Born in Samarkand
 of a Indian father and Sogdian mother, 
he went to China at age 10 after his 
father's death. In 719, he was ordained 
into the sangha by Vajrabodhi 金剛智 and 
became his disciple. After all foreign 
monks were expelled from China in 741, 
he and some associates went on a 
<pb n="709"/>
pilgrimage to gather texts, visiting Sri
 Lanka, Southeast Asia and India. During
 this voyage, he apparently met 
Nagabodhi 龍智, master of Vajrabodhi, and 
studied the Tattvasam!graha 金剛頂經 system 
at length. He returned to China in 746 
with some five hundred volumes. In 750, 
he left the court to join the military 
governorship of Geshu Han 哥舒翰, for whom 
he conducted large-scale tantric 
initations 灌頂 at field headquarters. In 
754, he translated the first portion of 
the Tattvasam!graha (T 865), the central
 text of Buddhist esotericism, which 
became one of his most significant 
accomplishments. He regarded its 
teachings as the most effective method 
for attaining enlightenment yet devised,
 and incorporated its basic schema in a 
number of writings. Amoghavajra was 
captured in general An Lushan's 安祿山 
rebellion but in 757 was freed by 
loyalist forces, whereupon he performed 
rites to purify the capital and 
consolidate the security of the Tang 
state. Two years later, he initiated the
 emperor Suzong 肅宗 as a cakravartin 轉輪王.
 In 765, Amoghavajra used his new 
rendition of the 'Scripture of Humane 
Kings' 仁王經 (T 246) in an elaborate 
<pb n="710"/>
ritual to counter the advance of a 200,
000-strong army of Tibetans and Uighurs 
which was poised to invade Zhangan 長安. 
Its leader, Pugu Huaien 仆固懷恩, dropped 
dead in camp and his forces dispersed. 
The opulent Jingao temple 金閣寺 on Mount 
Wutai was completed in 767, a pet 
project of Amoghavajra's, and one of his
 many efforts to promote the bodhisattva
 Man~ju/sri^ 文殊菩薩 as the protector of 
China. Amoghavajra continued to perform 
rites to avert disaster at the request 
of the emperor Taizong 太宗. On his death 
in 774, three days of morning were 
officially declared, and he posthumously
 received various exalted titles. The 
Chinese monks Huiguo 惠果 and Huilin 慧琳 
were among his most prominent successors
. Seventy-seven texts were translated by
 Amoghavajra according to his own 
account, though many more, including 
original compositions, are ascribed to 
him in the Chinese canons. The following
 documents relate to his life and work: 
(T 2120) contains records of his 
personal correspondence, (T 2156) 
records lineages, there is a biography 
in the Fu facang yinyuan fu 付法藏因緣傅 (T 
2058), and an account of his travels is 
given in (T 2157).

most influential figures in the entire 
history of Buddhism. Born in Gandha^ra 
in the fourth century, he was at first 
an Abhidharmist and wrote the massive 
Abhidharmako/sa-bha^sya 俱舍論. He later 
converted to Maha^ya^na and composed 
many other voluminous treatises. Most 
influential in the East Asian tradition 
was probably his Thirty Verses on 
Consciousness-only (Weishi sanshisong 唯識
<pb n="718"/>
三十頌), but he also wrote a large number 
of other works, including: a commentary 
to the Maha^ya^na-sam!graha 攝大乘論釋, the 
Dasabhu^mikabha^sya 十地經論, Catuh/sataka-/
sa^stra 廣百論, Maha^ya^na /satadharma^-
praka^/samukha /sa^stra 大乘百法明門論, Amita^
yus sutropade/sa 無量壽經優波提舍, and his 
Discourse on the Pure Land (Jingtulun 淨土
論).

<xa>世間靜慮</xa>
  The mundane meditation. A lower-level,
 tainted form of meditation in which one
 is able to eliminate coarse manifest

<xa>中蘊</xa>
  Same as 中有 and 中陰.


<xa>中觀派</xa>
  Ma^dhyamika, one of the major streams 
of Indian Maha^ya^na Buddhism which was 
to have a profound impact on all 
subsequent forms of Buddhism which arose
 in East Asia and Tibet. Based chiefly 
in the "middle way" 中論 philosophy of Na^
ga^rjuna 龍樹, the Ma^dhyamika thinkers 
sought to investigate a middle ground 
between the two extremes of existence 有 
<pb n="721"/>
or non-existence 無 of things. Seen 
through the logic of dependent co-
arising 緣起, all things were seen to be 
lacking of inherent nature 自性--to be 
empty 空. The most important successor to
 Na^ga^rjuna in the development of this 
school was a^ryadeva 聖提婆　(170-270, also 
commonly written 提婆) who helped to 
complete the framework of the Ma^
dhyamika system in his Catuh-/sataka 四百論
, etc. He was followed a few centuries 
later by such figures as Buddhapa^lita (
佛護, c.470-540), Bha^vaviveka (清辯, c. 490
-570) and Candraki^rti (月稱, c. 650), who
 worked out, each in their own ways 
various types of proofs for the 
explanation of and apprehension of the 
nature of emptiness. Some of the most 
important basic antagonistic positions 
within the broad Ma^dhyamika tradition 
can be seen in the disagreement between 
Bha^vaviveka and Candraki^rti: while Bha
^vaviveka used one form of logical 
argumentation to establish the truth of 
emptiness in a positive manner, Candraki
^rti denied the validity of the use of 
logical propositions which ended up 
affirming any sort of positive position.
 This basic disagreement would become 
embedded within the Ma^dhyamika school 
<pb n="722"/>
to the extent that two distinct 
philosophical factions developed: the 
Sva^trantika (Dulilunzhengpai 獨立論證派), 
which basically followed the position of
 Bha^vaviveka and the Pra^san!gika (
Guimiulunzhengpai 歸謬論證派), which 
supported the opinion of Buddhapa^lita 
and Candraki^rti. Some later (eighth 
century) Ma^dhyamika thinkers such as S/
a^ntaraks!ita 寂護 and Kamala/si^la 蓮華戒 
blended the Ma^dhyamika theories 
together with that of the Yoga^ca^ra 
movement, which had risen in popularity 
during the fifth century. The Three-
treatise school 三論宗 which arose in East 
Asia was based primarily in the basic 
positions of the school's earliest 
thinkers, Na^ga^rjuna and a^ryadeva.

 Kuma^raji^va 鳩摩羅什 translated it in 409,

basic text for the study of Ma^dhyamika 
中觀派 thought. The text opposed rigid 
categories of existence 假 and non-
existence 空, and denied the two extremes
 of arising and non-arising.


<xa>中道</xa>
  (1) The 'middle way,' a common term 
for the Buddhist path. In the earlier 
Pali literature it refers to a path that
 avoids the extremes of asceticism and 
self-satisfaction. (2) Later, during the
 development of Maha^ya^na Buddhism, 
especially as taught by Na^ga^rjuna 龍樹 
and others, it refers to the cultivation
 of the enlightened mindfulness which is
 not trapped in the extremes of nihi^ism
 or eternalism, or being and non-being. 
Also used as an informal term to refer 
to the Ma^dhyamika 中觀派 school, which was
 founded by Na^ga^rjuna.(3) During the 
latter Silla in Korea, a school named 
Chungdo arose from somewhat uncertain 
origins, but which was not associated 
with the Sanlun school.

Na^ga^rjuna 龍樹, more commonly rendered 
in Chinese as 中觀派 .(2) A Koryo period 
school in Korea, considered to be a 
later extension of the Popsong 法性 school
.


<xa>中道教</xa>
  During the "third period" of the 
Buddha's teaching (according to the 
Faxiang 法相 sect), the teaching of 
emptiness of the second period, and the 
teaching of the first period on 
existence are stopped in favor of the 
explanation of "neither emptiness nor 
existence" (Sam!dhinirmocana-su^tra 解深密經
).


<xa>中邊分別論</xa>

as Zhongbian lun 中邊論 and also known as 
the Bian zhongbian lun 辯中邊論: the Madhya^
nta-vibha^ga (Analysis of the Middle and
 the Extremes). A seminal Yoga^ca^ra 
<pb n="725"/>
text that is traditionally said to be a 
writing of Maitreya 彌勒 with Vasubandhu's
 commentary, but is considered by 
scholars to more likely be the joint 
effort of Asan%ga 無著 and Vasubandhu 世親. 
The special focus of this text is on the
 Yoga^ca^ra articulation of the meaning 
of mistaken discrimination 虛妄分別 vs. the 
meaning of emptiness of inherent nature 
空性, with the aim of breaking attachment 
to extreme notions of emptiness 有 and 
existence 無. There are two Chinese 
translations: (1) Three fascicle 
translation by Xuanzang (T 1600.31.464-

<xa>事障</xa>
  The "phenomenal hindrances," which, 
according to the Sutra of Perfect 
Enlightenment, along with the "noumenal 
hindrances" (lizhang 理障) impede the 
attainment of enlightenment. The 
phenomenal hindrances are those of the 
human passions of like and dislike, and 
all other related addictive or painful 
emotions which keep sentient beings 
<pb n="740"/>
bound in the cycle of life and death. 
Therefore, these hindrances are 
analogous to the "hindrances of 
affliction" (fannaozhang 煩惱障) of the 
school of Consciousness-only. Compared 
to the hindrances of principle, they are
 relatively superficial, and thus may be
 overcome by the practices of the two 
vehicles 二乘. (圓覺經, T 842.17.916b20 ff.)


<xa>二</xa>

ness", "self and other."


<xa>二乘</xa>
  The "two vehicles" of /sra^vaka 聲聞 and
 pratyekabuddha 辟支佛. These two 
practitioners are regularly introduce in
 Maha^ya^na literature where they are 
cast in a negative light as 
representatives of the so-called "hi^
naya^na" 小乘 tradition, where they are 
set up in contradistinction to the 
bodhisattva 菩薩. They are understood as 
practitioners who are engaged in a view 
toward practice and enlightenment which 
will permit them to reach the level of 
arhatship 阿羅漢 and not Buddhahood. This 
<pb n="741"/>
means that they are able to permanently 
sever the multitude of afflictions 
engendered by the three poisons 三毒. But 
they are unable to progress further 
along the path in the manner of the 
bodhisattva due to a lack in the 
development of their compassion 慈悲 for 
other beings as well as a limitation in 
their understanding of the emptiness 空 
of all phenomena 法. One of the first 
Maha^ya^na scriptures to make detailed 
distinctions between the practitioners 
of the two vehicles and the bodhisattvas
 was the S/ri^ma^la^-su^tra 勝鬘經.


<xa>二依</xa>
  Two kinds of defilement: the dirty 
aspects that exist with the body such as
 blood, puss, phlegm, etc. and the dirty
 aspects that appear on the outside of 
the body, such as inflammation, swelling
, rotten skin, etc. ［瑜伽論、 T 1579.30.428c
］


<xa>二依處</xa>
  Two loci of reliance in the 
Yogacarabhumi-/sa^stra: (1) the proper 
discernment of the true principle that

 understanding in the spiritual power of
 individual existence (pudgala). ［瑜伽論T

<xa>二入</xa>
  The two entrances to enlightenment as 
found in the teachings of Bodhidharma

<xa>二障義</xa>
  The Ijang'ui; "The Doctrine of the Two
 Hindrances." An in-depth treatise 
concerning the various theories 
developed on the doctrine of the two 
hindrances 二障 of the Yoga^ca^ra school 瑜
伽行派, by Wonhyo 元曉. HPC 1.789-814. This 
treatise examines and compares the 
various explications regarding the two 
hindrances as found in the major Yoga^ca
^ra texts, most prominent of which are 
the Yoga^ca^rabhu^mi-/sa^stra 瑜伽論, Sam!
dhinirmocana-su^tra 解深密經, Maha^ya^na^
bhidharma-samuccaya-vya^khya^ 對法論, S/ri^
ma^la^devi^-simhana^da-su^tra 勝鬘經 and 
Prakarana^ryava^ca-/sa^stra 顯揚論. Wonhyo 
first defines characteristics the 
hindrances in great depth, in terms of 
both esoteric an exoteric 
interpretations. He then explains how 
they are to be removed in terms of the 
various Yoga^ca^ra path scenarios, how 
their removal is handled by different 
<pb n="757"/>
classes of practitioners, and so forth. 
It is one of the most instructive works 
available for understanding the Buddhist
 notions of defilment/affliction and the
 obstructions to enlightenment created 
by the discriminating human mind.

<xa>五教</xa>
  'five teachings.' According to the 
content of meaning, format, or time 
period, the teachings of the various 
scriptures are classified into five 
types. This is usually done according to
 the shallowness and depth of the 
teaching. The five classifications of 
Huayan 華嚴 and Tiantai 天台 are the most 
common, but during the early period of 
classification (the period of division 
of China into northern and southern 
dynasties) there were a number of 
classifications done. A few of these are
 as follows:
(A) That propounded by Zigui 自軌 consists
 of these five: (1) the teaching of 
causal arising (Sarva^stiva^din, etc.); 
(2) the teaching of provisional names (
Chengshi lun, etc.); (3) the teaching of
 the negation of reality (Prajn~a^pa^
ramita^ sutras); (4) the teaching of 
reality (Nirva^na Sutra); (5) the 
teaching of the Reality-realm (Avatam!
<pb n="767"/>
saka Su^tra).
(B) The classification done by Huikuan 慧
觀 and Fayan 法雲 of (1) the teaching of 
the existence of form (a^gama s); (2) 
the teaching of the non-existence of

<xa>五時</xa>
  'five teaching periods.' A division of
 the periods of the varying methods used
 by S/a^kyamuni to explain the dharma 
from the time he attained enlightenment 
until the time he entered nirvana. 
Though there are various theories 
regarding these five, all are generally 
<pb n="769"/>
derived from the original explanation 
propounded by Huikuan 慧觀 in the fifth 
century. (A) Huikuan's explanation 
divides the teaching into gradual 漸 and 
sudden 頓, further dividing sudden into 
the following five: (1) the Distinct 
Teaching of the Three Vehicles (a^gama 
Sutras, etc.); (2) the Three Vehicle 
Shared Teaching (Prajn~a^pa^ramita^ Su^
tra s, etc.); (3) the Restraining and 
Praising Teaching (Vimalaki^rti Sutra 維摩
經, etc.); (4) the Teaching of the Shared
 Intent (Avatam!saka-su^tra 華嚴經, etc.) 
and (5) the Eternal Teaching (Nirva^na-
su^tra 涅槃經, etc.). This is the 
classification of the "Nirva^na school."
 (B) In the Huayan teaching of Liuqiu 劉 
the Avatam!saka-su^tra is called the "
Sudden teaching" and the "gradual 
teaching" is divided into the following 
five: (1) The Teaching of Men and Gods; 
(2) The Teaching of the Existence of 
Form (the a^gamas and so forth, that 
accept the existence of discriminated 
forms); (3) The Formless Teaching (prajn
~a^pa^ramita^ teaching, etc., that 
denies the real existence of form); (4) 
The Teaching of Shared Intent (Lotus 
Sutra, etc.) and (5) The Eternal 
Teaching (Nirva^na Sutra etc.) (C) Zhiyi
<pb n="770"/>
 altered the above (B) somewhat. 
According to Tiantai 天台 teaching, the 
five periods are: (1) The Huayan period.
 After the Buddha's enlightenment, he 
expounded the Avatam!saka-su^tra for 21 
days for bodhisattvas. This was a 
teaching for those of very sharp 
faculties, and according to this 
teaching such bodhisattvas may directly 
awaken to the reality-principle. (2) The
 Deer Park period. After delivering the 
Avatam!saka-su^tra, ordinary people of 
undeveloped faculties are not able to 
understand, so he discards this teaching
 in favor of guiding people through 
expedient teachings. Thus he delivered 
the lesser vehicle teachings at Deer 
Park near Benares. This period was 
twelve years, and the scriptures that 
developed from this are the a^gamas, so 
it is also called the "a^gama period." (
3) The Vaipulya period (Elementary Maha^
ya^na). For the people that had grasped 
the Hi^naya^na teachings, the Buddha now
 teaches Maha^ya^na Sutras such as the 
Vimalaki^rti Sutra, the Su^tra of the 
Golden Light and the Srimala Su^tra 勝鬘經,
 broadly explaining the Tripitaka, 
Shared, Distinct and Perfect Teachings. 
This is intended to convert people from 
<pb n="771"/>
Hi^naya^na to Maha^ya^na. This period 
lasts for eight years. (4) Perfection of
 Wisdom. For 22 years the Buddha teaches
 the Prajn~a^pa^ramita^ sutras in order 
to awaken people to the principle of 
emptiness. (5) The Lotus and Nirva^na 
period. The Buddha makes clear that the 
final goal of Hi^naya^na and Maha^ya^na 
is to same. Thus it is also called the 
Teaching of the Single Vehicle, wherein 
the presence of Buddha-nature in each 
person is affirmed.


<xa>五時八教</xa>
  A doctrinal classification system as 
explained by Zhiyi. The order in which S
/a^kyamuni taught the dharma is broken 
down into five periods (see wu-chiao 五教)
. The methods which he used are also 
broken down into four types, and the 
contents of the teaching into four 
categories. (A) The four methods of 
teaching are: (1) the Sudden Teaching 頓教
, which is the teaching of the direct 
awakening to the Buddha-nature; (2) the 
Gradual Teaching 漸教, where one is lead 
from shallow understanding to deep 
understanding; (3) the Secret 
Indeterminate Teaching, where the 
<pb n="772"/>
aspirants secretly receive teaching 
appropriate to their own abilities 
without being aware of the presence of 
others and (4) the Express Indeterminate
 Teaching, where the listeners, though 
aware of each other, still receive 
teaching according to their individual 
capacities. There is, in addition to 
this, the method of "neither sudden nor 
gradual, neither secret nor variable", 
also known as the "method of the Lotus 
and Nirva^na Sutras. (B) The four types 
of content are (1) Hi^naya^na or "
Tripitaka" teachings; (2) "Pervasive" or
 "Shared" 通　teachings. This is Maha^ya^
na teaching that includes the teaching 
of Vaipulya, Prajn~a^pa^ramita^, Lotus 
and Nirva^na, and is for /sra^vakas, 
pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas; (3) 
the Distinct Teaching. This is teaching 
for bodhisattvas only. The practitioners
 understanding has its emphasis on the 
middle truth of understanding emptiness 
and existence. Huayan teaching is 
typical of this type. (4) The Perfect 
Teaching. Enlightenment and delusion do 
not differ in essence. The teaching of 
the perfect mutual penetration and 
containment of all things, the 
explanation of the Buddha's 
<pb n="773"/>
enlightenment exactly as it is. The 
perfect teaching is actually contained 
in all the other teachings, but is most 
excellently put forth in the Lotus Sutra
 法華經.

 The viewpoint that all existence, 
<pb n="782"/>
including our own, lies in the

and matter. The five skandhas are the 
division of matter and mind into five

refers to images that surface in the 
mind. Symbolic function. 'Impulse' 行 (
samska^ra) is will, intention, or the 
mental function that accounts for 
craving. The power of formation 
potential. It is also understood as all 
of the general mental functions not 
included in the skandhas of feeling or 
perception. 'Consciousness' 識 (vijn~a^na
) is the cognitive, or discriminating 
function. Knowing through discrimination
.

bodhisattvas taught in the Maha^
parinirva^n!a-su^tra 涅槃經: the three 
disciplines　聖行; compassionate deeds on 
behalf of sentient beings　梵行; 
spontaneous acts on behalf of others　天行;

<xa>五見</xa>
  Five kinds of mistaken perception, the
 "five views" (pan~ca-dr!s!t!i), also 
written as 五惡見 and 惡見. These are: (1) "
Self view"--the attached view of the 
reality of the inherent existence of one
's own self, coupled with the belief in 
the real selfhood of the objects in one'
s surrounding world (satka^ya-dr!s!t!i).
 Expressed as 我見, 身見 and 有身見. (2) 
Extreme view 邊見, which is attachment to 
the positions of either eternalism or 
nihi^ism (antaparigraha-dr!s!t!i). (3) 
Evil view 邪見 (mithya^-dr!s!t!i), wherein
 one does not properly acknowledge the 
relationship of cause and effect). (4) 
The view of attachment to views 見取見, i.e
., holding rigidly to one opinion over 
all others. (dr!s!t!i-para^mar/sa-dr!s!t
!i). (5) The view of rigid attachment to
 the precepts 戒禁取見. The view that the 
<pb n="785"/>
austerities, moral practices and vows of
 non-Buddhist sects can lead one to the 
truth (/si^la-vrata-para^mar/sa-dr!s!t!i
). This set of views without the last, 
are called the four views 四見.


<xa>五識</xa>
  The five consciousnesses produced in 
connection with the five sense organs of
 eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin, 
which take as their objects the five 
physical categories of form, sound, 
smell, taste and tactile objects: 
therefore, the visual consciousness 眼識, 
auditory consciousness 耳識, olfactory 
consciousness 鼻識, gustatory 
consciousness 舌識 and tactile 
consciousness 身識. Since these are 
considered to be the first five among 
the six consciousnesses 六識, they are 
commonly referred to as the "prior five 
consciousnesses" in Chinese, 前五識. In the
 doctrine of the Yoga^ca^ra school, 
these are the first five among the eight
 consciousnesses 八識. In terms of the 
three realms , those in the desire realm
 are said to have six consciousnesses; 
those in the first meditation heaven of 
the form realm lack the olfactory and 
<pb n="786"/>
gustatory consciousnesses, while those 
in the second meditation heaven and 
above maintain only the sixth (
discriminating) consciousness. (panca-
vijn~a^na)［俱舍論］ {II} The five 
consciousnesses taught in the Awakening 
of Faith: (1) The activity (karmic) 
consciousness 業識, which arises with the 
unenlightened mind due to original 
ignorance. (2) The changing (
transforming) consciousness 轉識, wherein 
the activity consciousness undergoes a 
single transformation producing the 
subjective view. (3) The manifesting 
consciousness 現識, in which based on 
transformation of the activity 
consciousness the objective world is 
manifested. (4) The knowing 
consciousness 智識, in which the mind 
creates mistaken discrimination based on
 its perception of the objects in the 
external world. (5) The continuing 
consciousness 相續識, wherein, based on 
mistaken discrimination, the thoughts of
 pain and pleasure continue without 
abatement, thus enabling the continuity 
of sam!sa^ra. ［起信論、 T 1666.32.577b］

<xa>五重唯識</xa>
  'Five-fold Consciousness-only.' The 
five levels of the apprehension of the 
principle of consciousness-only 唯識. 
These are five kinds of distinctions

shallow to deep. They are: (1) The 
consciousness of expelling the false and
 abiding in the real; (2) The 
consciousness of the expulsion of 
confusion and holding to true awareness;
 (3) Holding to the function and 
returning to the essence; (4) Concealing
 the mean and manifesting the superior; 
(5) dispelling manifestations and 
<pb n="790"/>
apprehending the true nature. This 
theory of five layers appears in Kuiji's

  Hyujong　(1520-1604); a Choson dynasty 
Son monk who can be counted among the 
five most important figures in Korean 
Buddhist history; commonly known in 
Korea by the respectful title Sosan 
Taesa 西山大師. He was an influential 
teacher and writer, who is said to have 
guided hundreds of students, a number of
 whom turned into Son masters in their 
own right. He played a major role in 
consolidating the forms of study and 
<pb n="805"/>
practice of Korean Son which would, by 
and large, remain in place down to 
modern times. What has made Hyujong most
 respected in the broad view of Korean 
history was his role in the creation and
 guidance of an army of monks, which 
played a decisive role in the eventual 
repulsion of the Japanese invasion by 
the armies of Hideyoshi Toyotomi 秀吉禮臣.
In addition to serving in this unusual 
capacity of military leader, Sosan was a
 first-rate Son master and the author of
 a number of important religious texts, 
the most important of which is his Songa
 kwigam 禪家龜鑒, a guide to Son practice 
which is studied by Korean monks down to
 the present. Like most monks of the 
Choson period, he had been initially 
educated in Neo-Confucian philosophy. 
Dissatisfied, he wandered through the 
mountain monasteries, eventually joining
 the sangha. Later, after making a name 
for himself as a teacher, he was made 
arbiter of the Son school by queen 
Munjong. He soon resigned from this 
responsibility, returning to the 
itinerant life, advancing his Son 
studies and teaching at monasteries all 
around Korea. He died at 85, leaving 
behind some 1000 disciples, 70 of whom 
<pb n="806"/>
were monks and nuns, and many of whom 
held a prominent role in the later 
transmission of Choson Buddhism.
Hyujong is also known for his efforts in
 the continuation of the project of the 
unification of Buddhist doctrinal study 
and practice. He is considered the 
central figure in the revival of Choson 
Buddhism, and most major streams of 
modern Korean Son trace their lineages 
back to him through one of his four main
 disciples: Yujong 惟政; Ongi 彥機, T'aenung
 太能 and Ilson 一禪, all four of whom were 
assistants to Sosan during the war with 
Japan.

<xa>佛</xa>
  (1) The most basic meaning of the 
Sanskrit and Pali term buddha is that of
 "awakened," in the special sense of one
 who has awakened to the true nature of 
existence. In this sense, the meaning is
 often translated as "enlightened" 覺. (2
) One who has completely extinguished 
all afflictive states of mind 煩惱 --who 
utterly lacks all the mixed 
manifestations of ignorance 無明, desire 貪
, and dislike 嗔. (3) The historical 
Buddha, S/a^kyamuni, who lived in India 
during the 6th century BCE, who had a 
major enlightenment experience, who 
subsequently taught others the way to 
achieve libertion, and following whose 
death, the religious movement called 
Buddhism, was formed. (3) Any one of a 
number the Buddhas who are said to exist
 in the world. In the early Pali 
tradition, six are name, but in the 
later developing Maha^ya^na tradition, 
Buddhas are understood to be infinite in
 number. In this sense, anyone who 
attains release (moks!a 解脫, nirva^n!a 涅槃
) from this world of recurring rebirths 
<pb n="821"/>
(sam!sa^ra 流轉) can be called, in the 
appropriate contexts, a Buddha. (4) 
Buddha as an eternal principle of 
enlightenment/reality, expressed in the 
notion of the dharmaka^ya 法身 of the 
Buddha. (5) Buddha as buddhahood 佛地, the
 final stage one attains as the result 
of practices.

Also called the Fodilun 佛地論. The author 
explains the five kinds of dharma taught
 in the Buddha-bhu^mi 佛地經. Contains 
combined commentaries on the Buddha-bhu^

attainment of buddhahood, not fully 
actualized. The belief in this concept 
was not universally accepted in Indian 
Buddhism, but did become a cornerstone

  The Foxing lun, Buddha-nature Treatise
, written in four fascicles. T 1610.31.
787a-813a. Attributed to Vasubandhu 世親, 
translated by Parama^rtha 真諦. This 
treatise discusses the theory of the 
Buddha-nature in great detail in sixteen
 chapters, from the four aspects of: (1)
<pb n="827"/>
 dependent arising; (2) breaking 
attachment; (3) manifestation of essence
; and (4) discriminated aspects. In the 
course of explaining how it is that all 
sentient beings have the buddha-nature, 
the mistaken views of non-Buddhists 外道

  The Pulssi chappyon (Arguments Against
 the Buddhists), a late 14th century 
Korean Neo-Confucian polemical critique 
of Buddhism by Chong Tojon (鄭道傳 pen name
: Sambong 三峰 1342-1398). In this work he
 carried out his most comprehensive 
refutation of Buddhism, singling out 
Buddhist doctrines and practices for 
detailed criticism. Chong stated that 
this book was written with the objective
 of refuting Buddhism once and for all "
lest it destroy morality and eventually 
humanity itself." The charges leveled 
against Buddhism in the Pulsshi chappyon
 constitute a full inventory of the 
various arguments made by Confucians and
 Neo-Confucians from the time of the 
introduction of Buddhism into East Asia 
<pb n="831"/>
during the second century C.E. These 
arguments are arranged in eighteen 
sections, each of which is a critique on
 a particular aspect of Buddhist

<xa>佛護</xa>
  Buddhapa^lita (ca.470-540) a major 
scholar of the Indian Ma^dhyamika school
 中觀派. He was known for the the 
development of a negative dialectic in 
the proof of the concept of emptiness, 
which put his way of thinking at odds 
with such Ma^dhyamika masters as Bha^
vaviveka (清辯, c. 490-570), but in 
agreement with later figures such as 
Candraki^rti (月稱, c. 650). Some of the 
most important basic antagonistic 
positions within the broad Ma^dhyamika 
tradition can be seen in the 
disagreement between Bha^vaviveka and 
Buddhapa^lita: while Bha^vaviveka used 
one form of logical argumentation to 
establish the truth of emptiness in a 
positive manner, Buddhapa^lita denied 
<pb n="837"/>
the validity of the use of logical 
propositions which ended up affirming 
any sort of positive position. The 
position taken by Buddhapa^lita and 
Candraki^rti would later end up in the 
creation of a distinct branch of Ma^
dhyamika called Pra^san!gika (
guimiulunzhengpai 歸謬論證派).


<xa>佛身</xa>
  (buddha-ru^pa; buddha-ka^ya). The 
Buddha's (physical) body. As a result of
 the questions of Buddhist followers, 
inquiries were made resulting in "buddha
-body theory." S/a^kyamuni himself 
established the position of believing in
 the true principle (dharma): that he 
himself would die but the dharma was 
indestructible and therefore said that 
after his death the dharma was to be 
depended upon. However, many disciples 
held to their concept of the Buddha's 
person and believed in it as the Buddha-
dharma, and therefore, even while S/a^
kyamuni was still in the world his body 
had come to be seen as transcendent. 
Because of this, after he died, the 
dharma that he had explained was 
regarded as indestructible, and was set 
<pb n="838"/>
up in contrast with his natural body, 
bringing about a 'two body' theory.


<xa>佛道</xa>
  Literally, the "buddha-way," which 
means the path to the buddhahood, but 
also often refers the Buddha's 
enlightenment in itself; buddhahood. The
 terms seems to have developed in East 
Asia without a Sanskrit equivalent (
although it can be equated with the 
Indian concept of bodhi), often used to 
indicate the enlightenment which is the 
original endowment of all sentient 
beings. See, for example T 842.17.913c (
圓覺經).


<xa>佛陀</xa>
  (1) Chinese transcription of the 
Sanskrit buddha, meaning "awakened," or 
the "awakened one." Most East Asian 
writers and translators shortened this 
to the first character 佛. (2) These two 
characters also form the first part of 
the names of many monks from India and 
Central Asia.


<pb n="839"/>
<xa>佛陀伽耶</xa>
  Buddhagaya^, the name of the place 
where S/a^kyamuni is recorded as having 
attained his enlightenment. Pronounced 
in modern Hindi as Bodhgaya^. Located 
about 10 km. south of the modern day 
city of Gaya in Biharu.


<xa>佛陀多羅</xa>
  Buddhatra^ta, the name given in the 
colophon of the Sutra of Perfect 
Enlightenment 圓覺經 as its "translator." 
The facticity of this is questionable, 
since it seems fairly certain that the 
sutra was composed in China. Buddhatra^
ta's name also does not seem to be found
 in connection with any other texts.


<xa>佛陀扇多</xa>
  Buddha/sa^nta, whose name is 
translated into Chinese according to its
 meaning as Jueding 覺定. Originally from 
northern India, he came in 511 to the 
Northern Wei, where he cooperated with 
Bodhiruci 菩提流支 and Ratnamati 勒那摩提 in the
 translation of the Da/sabhu^mika-/sa^
stra 十地經論. He later resided at White 
Horse Temple, where he translated the

<xa>俱生煩惱</xa>
  The (four) innately produced 
<pb n="855"/>
afflictions that are concomitant with 
the seventh (manas) consciousness 末那識; 
synonymous with 任運煩惱. Also <_-xa>俱生障</_-xa>and 俱生起. Afflictions, karma, etc., that
 have been carried over from previous 
lifetimes, which are therefore more 
deeply embedded. These are usually 
considered to be removable during the 
Path of Cultivation 修道. These are 
contrasted to the afflictions produced 
by discrimination in the present 
lifetime 分別煩惱, which can be removed 
earlier, in the Path of Seeing 見道.


<xa>俱生起</xa>

  'Simultaneously produced hindrances,' 
or 'innate hindrances.' A term used by 
the Yoga^ca^ra school 瑜伽行派. Hindrances 
that arise simultaneously with the mind.
<pb n="856"/>
 In the attachment to self, there is 
attachment due to discriminating a self 
through thought. Yet even when purposely
 suppressing this kind of thought, there
 is a spontaneously arisen attachment to
 self. Even though one is trying not to 
give rise to such thought and trying to 
suppress the self-view, still an 
attachment to self arises. This is what 
is called "arising together with the 
mind." This arising occurs in the 
seventh consciousness as well as the 
sixth consciousness. The seeds produced 
by this hindrance are different from 
those produced by the 'discriminated 
arising' 分別障 hindrance. Since the 
discriminated arising hindrance is cut 
off when one awakens to the principle of
 dependent origination, they are cut off
 at one time during the Path of Seeing (
jiandao 見道). However, the hindrance of 
simultaneous arising is habituated, so 
even if one understands the principle of
 the Way, the hindrance will still arise
. Since the habituated nature has 
developed, one must repeatedly practice 
the contemplation of dependent 
origination in order to cut off this 
hindrance. <_-xa>俱生起</_-xa> Also written 俱
生煩惱.

<xa>俱解脫</xa>
<pb n="858"/>
  Simultaneous liberation. As 
distinguished from wisdom liberation 慧解脫
, where one uses wisdom alone to 
accomplish freedom from the hindrances 
of affliction 煩惱障, one instead uses both
 wisdom and concentration to liberate 
oneself both from the hindrances of 
affliction, and the hindrances of 
liberation 解脫障. Due to this liberation, 
one attains the sama^dhi of total annihi
^ation 滅盡定. One of the 二十七堅聖 and one of

seeing 見道, the practitioner renews his 
efforts based on this new insight, 
seeking further accordance with reality.
 The afflictions that are eliminated in 
this path are those that are more deeply

afflictions (俱生、思惑), whereas the prior 
path of seeing is able to eliminate the 
less deeply embedded afflictions (分別起、見惑
). In the Abhidharmako/sa, the entry

<xa>元曉</xa>
  Wonhyo (617-686). One of the leading 
thinkers, writers and commentators of 
the Korean Buddhist tradition. With his 
life spanning the end of the Three 
Kingdoms period and the beginning of the
 Unified Silla, Wonhyo played a vital 
role in the reception and assimilation 
of the broad range of doctrinal Buddhist
 streams that flowed into the Korean 
peninsula at the time. Wonhyo was most 
interested in, and affected by Tatha^
gatagarbha 如來藏, Consciousness-only 唯識 
and Hwaom 華嚴 thought. However, in his 
extensive scholarly works, addressed in 
commentaries and essays, he embraced the
 whole spectrum of the Buddhist 
teachings which were received in Korea, 
including such schools as Pure Land 淨土宗,
 Nirvana 涅槃宗, Sanlun 三論宗 and Tiantai 天台宗
 (Lotus Sutra school). He wrote 
commentaries on virtually all of the 
most influential Maha^ya^na scriptures, 
altogether including over eighty works 
in over two hundred fascicles. Among his
<pb n="883"/>
 most influential works were the 
commentaries he wrote on the Awakening 
of Faith 大乘起信論, Nirvana Sutra 涅槃經 and 
Vajrasama^dhi Sutra 金剛三昧經. These were 
treated with utmost respect by leading 
Buddhist scholars in China and Japan, 
and served to help in placing the 
Awakening of Faith as the most 
influential text in the Korean tradition
.
Wonhyo spent the earlier part of his 
career as a monk, but after a "
consciousness-only" enlightenment 
experience, he left the priesthood and 
turned to the spreading of the 
buddhadharma as a layman. Because of 
this aspect of his character, Wonhyo 
ended up becoming a popular folk hero in
 Korea. He was a colleague and friend of
 the influential Silla Hwaom monk Uisang
 義湘, and an important result of their 
combined works was the establishment of 
Hwaom as the dominant stream of 
doctrinal thought on the Korean 
peninsula. Wonhyo's 23 extant works are 
currently in the process of being 
translated into English as a joint 
project between Dongguk University and 
SUNY at Stony Brook.

 combining two kinds of interpretations 
of the Four Noble Truths, the so-called 
created four noble truths 有作四諦 and 
uncreated four noble truths 無作四諦. The 
former are understood as incomplete 
understandings of the four noble truths 
held by the practitioners of the two 
vehicles 二乘, and the latter are complete
 understandings possessed by 
bodhisattvas 菩薩. ［勝鬘經法身品、仁王般若經疏卷三］ {II} 
As taught in the Yoga^ca^rabhu^mi-/sa^
stra, (1) the truth of suffering of 
transience 行苦諦，wherein all conditioned 
existence arises and ceases without 
interruption. (2) the truth of suffering
 by destruction 壞苦諦，wherein one suffers 
by the disappearance of desirable 
objects. (3) the truth of everyday 
suffering 苦苦諦，wherein one meets 
disagreeable objects. (4) the truth of 
transmigration 流轉諦，or fragmentary sam!sa

<xa>八識</xa>
  The eight consciousnesses (as!t!a-vijn
~a^na^ni), the articulation of which 
forms one of the most seminal and 
distinctive aspects of the doctrine of 
the Yoga^ca^ra 瑜伽行派 school of Buddhism, 
known in East Asia as Dharma-character 法
相 school and Consciousness-only 唯識 
school. According to this doctrine, 
sentient beings possess eight distinct 
layers of consciousness, the first five 
五識 corresponding the sense perceptions, 
the sixth 意識 to the thinking mind, the 
seventh 末那識 to the notion of ego, and 
the eighth 阿賴耶識 as repository of all the
 impressions from one's experiences. As 
the first seven of these arise based on 
the eighth, they are called the 
transformed consciousnesses 轉識. In 
contrast, the eighth is known as the 
base consciousness 本識, store 
consciousness 藏識, or seed consciousness

<xa>勒那摩提</xa>
  Ratnamati, whose name is translated 
into Chinese according to its meaning as
 Baoyi 寶意. A scholar-monk who came from 
central India to China to do significant
 translation work. He came to Loyang in 
the Northern Wei in 508, where he worked
 together with Bodhiruci 菩提流支 in the 
translation of the Da/sabhu^mika-/sa^
stra 十地經論. Apparently he had significant
 disagreements with Bodhiruci in the 
process of the translation work, and 
left to work on other projects,1 being 
listed as a collaborator in the 
translation of a dozen or so other works
. His chief disciple was Huiguang 慧光, 
who founded the southern branch of the 
Dilun school　地論宗.
(1) Lusthaus comments: "The tradition 
<pb n="967"/>
has not been as clear as we'd like about
 what exactly the difference was that 
sparked the disagreement between 
Bodhiruci (himself a good Yogacarin) and
 Ratnamati, and the so-called Dilun 
controversies of the 6th century obscure
 rather than illuminate them. The issue 
may have been -- already then -- 
Ratnamati's tendency to read in tatha^
gatagarbha ideas. Not that Bodhiruci 
would have been averse to tatha^
gatagarbha per se, but he wanted to 
render the texts in a manner true to the
 meaning as he understood it, in an 
orthodox Yogacarin sense (though the 
Dilun is not exactly a blatantly 
Yogacara text), and resented Ratnamati's
 intrusions."

zhang 華嚴孔目章, there are two kinds of ten 
Buddhas. The first ten are the ten 
buddhas of the realm of understanding. 
The bodhisattva, relying on the true 
wisdom of awakening, perceives that the 
dharma realm is all Buddha in ten 
aspects (bodies). These are the body of 
sentient beings, the body of lands, the 
karma reward body, the body of Buddhist 
disciples (arhats), the pratyekabuddha 
body, the bodhisattva body, the body of 
completely enlightened ones (tatha^gatas
), the body of knowledge, the reality-
body, and the body of space. The second 
group of ten are the buddhas of the 
realm of practice. These are the correct
 enlightenment Buddha, the desire-to-
save-sentient- beings Buddha, the karma-
reward Buddha, the holding-fast Buddha, 
the transformation Buddha, the dharma-
realm Buddha, the mind Buddha, the sama^
dhi Buddha, the original nature Buddha, 
and the Buddha who becomes what he 
wishes.

ignorance 癡, pride 慢, doubt 疑, view of 
self 身見, extreme view 邊見, evil view 邪見,

<xa>十信</xa>
  "Ten Faiths." The first ten stages in 
the 52 stage path of the bodhisattva. 
They are called the ten faiths, since 
faith is the entry of Buddhist practice.
 They are: 1. The Stage of Faith xinxin 
信心; of the arousal of true aspiration. 2
. The Stage of Mindfulness nianxin 念心; 
the stage of the cultivation of six 
kinds of mindfulness. 3. The Stage of 
Endeavor jingjinxin 精進心. 4. The Stage of
 Mental Stability dingxin 定心. 5. The 
Stage of the Wisdom of Understanding 
Emptiness huixin 慧心. 6. The Stage of 
Pure Self-restraint jiexin 戒心. 7. The 
<pb n="996"/>
Stage of the Returning of Merit 
huixiangxin 回向心. 8. The Stage of 
Maintaining the dharma Within Oneself

舍心. 10. The Stage of Aspiration yuanxin 
願心. Different sutras have their own 
versions of these ten. Among the sutras 
with alternative versions are: the 
Renwang jing 仁王經 , the Fanwangjing 梵網經, 
the Shoulengyan jing 首楞嚴經 and others.

 Noble Truths (s!od!a^/sa-a^ka^ra), 
which are sixteen ways of analyzing the

containing the meanings of impermanence 
無常 (anitya), unsatisfactoriness 苦 (duh!

 無我 (ana^tmaka). The second noble truth 
contains the implications of cause of 
suffering 因 (hetu), gathering 集 (
samudaya), continuation 生 (prabhava) and
 conditions 緣 (pratyaya). The third 
noble truth connotes extinction of 
physical attachments 滅 (nirodha), the

sublimity of no discomfort 妙 (pran!ita) 
and the escape from all difficult

they were used to accompany the

third expression of singularity is 
called dangtiquanshi 當體全是, the "essence 
is identical," which is exemplified by 
the fact that astringent persimmons and 
sweet persimmons are in essence, the 
same fruit; A, as it is, is B. This 
ideograph can also mean "absolutely the 
same," a usage which originally began in
 Tiantai writings. (4) Supposing, even

<xa>唯心訣</xa>
  Weixin jue; See Yung-ming chih-chiao 
ch'an-shih wei-hsin chüeh 永明智覺禪師唯心訣.


<xa>唯識</xa>
  (citta-ma^tra). "Consciousness-only (
vijn~apti-ma^trata^)." The theory that 
all existence is nothing but 
consciousness, and therefore there is 
nothing that lies outside of the mind. 
Consciousness-only was a major component
 of the thought of the school of Yoga^ca
^ra 瑜伽行派. The Vijn~a^nava^dins explained
 the regularity and coherence of sense 
impressions as due to an underlying 
store of perceptions (a^laya-vijn~a^na) 
阿賴耶識 evolving from the accumulation of 
traces of earlier sense perceptions. 
<pb n="68"/>
These are active, and produce 
impressions 種子 similar to themselves, 
according to a regular pattern, as seeds
 produce plants. Each being possesses a 
store of perceptions and beings which 
are generically alike will produce 
similar perceptions from their stores at
 the same time. Its doctrine reduces all
 existence to one hundred elements (法 
dharmas) into five divisions, namely, 
mind, mental function, material, not 
concomitant with mind and unconditioned,
 dharmas. According to this school, the 
external world is created when the a^
laya (storehouse) consciousness is 
influenced ('perfumated') 薰 by "seeds" 
or effects of good and evil deeds. 
Another important contribution of the 
Consciousness-only thinkers was that of 
the three natures of imaginary, 
provisional and real. <_-xa>三性</_-xa>
The major framework of Consciousness-
only theory was developed by Maitreya 彌勒
 and the two brothers Vasubandhu 世親 and 
Asan%ga 無著 in such treatises as the 
Abdhidharma-ko/sa-bha^sya 俱舍論, the Trim!
/sika^ Vijn~aptima^trata^siddhih! (
Thirty Verses on Consciousness-only) 唯識三
十頌, Maha^ya^na-sam!graha 攝大乘論, and the 
Yoga^ca^rabhu^mi-/sa^stra 瑜伽師地論. 
<pb n="69"/>
Consciousness-only doctrine was also 
defined in sutras such as the Sam!
dhinirmocana-su^tra and S/ri^ma^la^-su^
tra 勝鬘經. The Maha^ya^na-sam!graha, for 
example, says "All conscious objects are
 only constructs of consciousness 
because there are no external objects. 
They are like a dream" (如此眾識唯識 以無塵等故 譬如夢
等) ［攝大乘論 T 1593.31.118b12］(Keenan 1992: 
40).

Vasubandhu passed away without having 
ever written explanatory commentary on 
these verses, succeeding generations of 
scholars engaged in extensive debate 
over their interpretation, to the extent
 that various schools of Yoga^ca^ra 
developed. Among these interpretations, 
it was that by Dharmapa^la 護法 which came
 to be taken as orthodox. This 
commentary by Dharmapa^la formed the 
major content of the Vijn~aptima^trata^
<pb n="71"/>
siddhi-/sa^stra, which was translated 
into Chinese by Xuanzang 玄奘 as the Cheng
 weishi lun 成唯識論, in turn an important 
text in the formation of the Chinese 
Faxiang school 法相宗. T 1586.31.60a-61b.

<xa>唯識派</xa>
  The Consciousness-only school of 
thought, which took as its major tenet 
the concept that the experienced world 
is nothing other than the manifestation 
of our own consciousness. This basic 
view of the world formed the cornerstone
 of the doctrines of the Yoga^ca^ra 
school 瑜伽行派 in India as well as the "
Dharma-characteristic" sects 法相宗 of East
 Asia, and therefore the term "School of
 Consciousness-only" is regularly used 
to refer to either one of these sects. 
<pb n="73"/>
The Yoga^ca^ra 瑜伽行派 school of Indian 
Buddhism, which together with the Middle
 Way (Ma^dhyamika; 中觀派) school, 
represented one of the two main branches
 of Maha^ya^na philosophy. Its great 
teachers in India were Asan%ga (fourth 
century CE) 無著?無著 and his brother 
Vasubandhu 世親. When Asan%ga's works were
 first translated into Chinese in the 
sixth century CE, the school was known 
as Shelun 攝論宗, but eventually it was 
absorbed into the school of the great 
Chinese translator-monk Hsüan-tsang 玄奘 (
596-664). Hsüan-tsang's school was known
 as the Fa-hsiang ('dharma-
characteristic') school, after this main
 feature of its teachings.

returner, where one eliminates the 
remaining three afflictions removable in

elements.' 'Gross' (大) means 'element,' 
which all substances are composed of. 
These are: (1) tu 土 the earth element (
prthivi^ dha^tu), which has the basic 
quality of hardness and the function of 
protection; (2) shui 水 water (ab-dha^tu)
, which has the function of gathering 
and storing wetness; (3) 火 fire (teja-
dha^tu), which is the nature of heat and
 has the function of warming; (4) feng 風
 wind (va^yu^-dha^tu), which has the 
function of giving life to all living 
things. It is thought that when these 
are gathered, material substance is 
produced; therefore they are called the 
'forms of creatability.' In India, there
 are other transmissions of ideology 
whose explanations resemble this one, 
<pb n="97"/>
and even within Buddhism there are other
 explanations, but in the explanation of
 Abhidharma Buddhism, the objects of 
consciousness of earth, wind, fire and 
water are provisional elements, since 
the true elements are imperceptible.

<xa>四心</xa>
  The 'four thoughts' used by Vasubandhu
 in his commentary to the Diamond Sutra 
(T 1511.25.781c-782a) to outline Section
 Two of the Diamond Sutra,dividing it 
into four distinct passages (T 236.8.
753a). The title of each of the Four 
Thoughts is extracted from a verse of 
Asan%ga's Ode to the Diamond Sutra (
T1514), of which the Vasubandhu 
commentary is an annotation. This 
exegetical scheme used by Vasubandhu is 
usually found summarized in the Chinese 
exegetical texts. The Four Thoughts, and
 the passages they refer to are (using 
Bodhiruci's translation, T236/T1511):
1) The 'Broadly Extensive Thought' (廣大心)
. Corresponds to: "諸菩薩生如是心。所有一切眾生眾生所攝 ..
." to .".. 所有眾生界眾生所攝。" (T236.8.753a1-4)
2) The 'Supreme Thought' (第一心). 
Corresponds to: "我皆令入無餘涅槃而滅度之。" (T236.8.
753a4-5)
3) The 'Eternal Thought' (常心). 
Corresponds to: "如是滅度無量無邊眾生實無眾生得滅度者。何以故。
 須菩提。若菩薩有眾生相即非菩薩。" (T236.8.753a1-7) 
Vasubandhu comments that the living 
beings are not different from the 
<pb n="101"/>
bodhisattva's own self, and so if a 
bodhisattva conceives of the living 
beings as being separate from himself 
then he is not a bodhisattva. "Thusly 
apprehending the myriad beings as his 
own body, the eternal is not abandoned."
 (T1511.25.782a)
4) The 'Undeluded Thought' (不顛倒). 
Corresponds to: "何以故非。須菩提。若菩薩起眾生相人相壽者相。 
則不名菩薩。" (T236.8.753a7-8) Vasubandhu 
comments: "This makes plain the distant 
separation (of the bodhisattva) from, 
and accordingly the cessation of, a self
 which views the images of myriad beings
, etc." (T 1511.25.782a) It should be 
noted that one must use a translation of
 the Diamond Sutra other than Kuma^raji^
va's to follow the fourfold division, as
 Kuma^raji^va does not include the final
 conclusion to this section of the sutra
. The commentary by Vasubandhu was 
translated into Chinese by Bodhiruci 菩提流
支 (T1511-金剛般若波羅蜜經論) and Yijing 義淨 (T1513
-能斷金剛般若波羅蜜多經論釋), and those two versions 
of the Diamond Sutra are used in each 
respectively. Yijing also extracted Asan
%ga's Ode from a separate text (T1514).

meditation practice in the four 
meditative concentrations 四禪. There are 
various sources which describe these, 
but one of the most extensive is the 
Abhidharmako/sa-bha^sya 俱舍論, where they 
are discussed in connection with the 
term 四靜慮; the Zen gaku jiten cites a 
text called the Jietuodao lun 解脫道論. 
<pb n="116"/>
Those who practice the first meditative 
concentration in the present lifetime 
are born in the first meditation heaven 
into one of three different levels 
according to their proficiency in 
practice. Those of the lower level are 
born into heaven of Brahma followers 梵眾天
; those of middling level are born into 
the heaven of Brahma's ministers 梵輔天 and
 those of the superior level are born 
into the great Brahma heaven 大梵天. In 
similar fashion, those who practice the 
second meditation in the present life 
are born into three grades of heavens 
according to their proficiency in 
practice: the heaven of limited light 少光
天; the heaven of limitless light 無量光天 
and the heaven of ultimate light and 
purity 極光淨天. In the third heaven there 
are again three: the heaven of limited 
purity 少淨天, the heaven of limitless 
purity 無量淨天 and the heaven of pervasive 
purity 遍淨天. The fourth heaven has eight 
levels: the first three of these, the 
cloudless heaven 無雲天 the heaven of 
blessed birth 福生天 and the heaven of 
extensive fruition 廣果天 are attainable by
 unenlightened sentient beings; the 
final five are attained only by Buddhist
 saints who have consummated the

undefiled concentration of the fourth 
level: these are the heaven of no 
affliction 無煩天, the heaven of no heat 無熱

善現天, the heaven of skillful vision 善見天, 
and the heaven of ultimate form 色究竟天. ［俱

point of arising the mind of 
enlightenment. (3) The secret prediction

<xa>四種涅槃</xa>
  'Four kinds of Nirva^na.' In the 
teachings of the Yoga^ca^ra school, 
nirva^na is divided into four types. The
 first is the nirva^na of the originally
 pure self-nature, the original thusness
 of all existence. The second refers to 
the thusness expressed in the extinction
<pb n="119"/>
 of the hindrances due to defilement, 
and is called "nirva^na with remainder."
 The third is "nirva^na without 
remainder"; in this nirva^na the 
hindrances due to defilement in the mind
 are cut off, and the body in which the 
five skandhas was united is extinguished
. In the fourth, both the hindrances due
 to defilement and the hindrances of 
knowing are cut off, and a deep wisdom 
is attained wherein sam!sa^ra and nirva^
na are not distinguished. Not abiding in
 nirva^na nor disliking sam!sa^ra, one 
teaches sentient beings yet does not 
become attached to the world. This 
condition of complete separation from 
delusion is called "nirva^na with no 
abode."

<pb n="122"/>
  'four conditions', 'four causes.' {I} 
In the Consciousness-only 唯識 school, a 
broad division into four types, of the 
causes that produce all things. In this 
case, the ideograph yuan 緣 has the 
meaning of yin 因. This classification is
 used especially in explaining the "
nature of dependent arising 依他起性." The 
explanation of the relationship of these
 four causes to the "six causes" 六因 
differs between Consciousness-only and 
Abhidharma-ko/sa. The four are: (1) 
yinyuan 因緣 (hetu-pratyaya) a direct 
internal cause that produces a result. 
Refers to newly producing the fruit of a
 person--seeds and their manifestation. 
The production by the seeds in the a^
laya Consciousness of the world cognized
 through the seven consciousnesses. (2) 
dengwujianyuan 等無間緣 (sam!anantara-
pratyaya) Since the prior instant of 
mind/mental functioning gives rise 
directly to the succeeding instant of 
mind, there is no gap in their leading 
into one another. Also called cidiyuan 次
第緣. (3) suoyuanyuan 所緣緣 'Object as 
condition' (a^lambana-pratyaya). For the
 mind to arise, its object must be 
present, so every object becomes a cause
 for the mind. These objects are 
<pb n="123"/>
discriminated into the two types of 親 
and 疎. (4) zengshangyuan 增上緣 (adhipati-
pratyaya) 'Causes beyond direct 
empowerment.' This group includes all 
indirect causes outside the above three.
 Not only those things which give power 
to the production of results, but things
 which merely do not impede or hinder. {
II} In the Sutra of Perfect 
Enlightenment 圓覺經, the Four Elements (四大
). {III} In the Vajrasam!a^dhi-su^tra, 
the four causes are: (1) 作擇滅力取緣; (2) 本利根
淨所集起緣; (3) 本慧大悲力緣; (4) 一覺通智力緣. (T vol. 9

  <_-xa>達摩</_-xa>


<xa>圓覺寺</xa>
  (1) (China) (2) (Korea) (3) (Japan) 
The head temple of the Engakuji branch 
of Japanese Rinzai, located in Kita-
Kamakura, founded by Wúxué zuyuán 無學祖元 
in 1282. One of the five Zen temples in 
Kamakura. In the ages of Bun-ei and Koan
, Japan was attacked twice by Mongolia. 
It was the most unprecedented national 
<pb n="145"/>
crisis Japan ever met. Executive 
Tokimune Hojo, who had long embraced Zen
, profoundly carried out his daily study
 of Zen even during the dangerous period
 of Koan. Wúxué zuyuán (Bukko^ Kokushi佛光
國師) was the Chan master from China whom 
the executive looked up to. The Japanese
 nation engaged the formidable enemy as 
a whole and beat back the Mongolians. 
After this, Tokimune wished not only to 
spread the way of Zen that remained his 
mental support all the while, but to 
hold a mass for the souls, of both 
Japanese and Mongolian soldiers who laid
 down their life in those wars. He also 
wanted to express his gratitude to his 
master Bukko^. Thus, the building of a 
temple was envisioned. The temple was 
given the name of engaku after Engaku-
Kyo (Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment 圓覺經)
, dug out of the selected building site,
 in a stone chest.
          The establishment of Bukko^ 
sect was succeeded from Ko^ho^ Ken-nichi
 高峰顯日 of Nasu Ungen-ji to Muso Soseki 夢窓
疎石 of Tenryu^-ji 天龍寺. Especially Muso 
was respected as 'the master of seven 
emperors' in the era of Northern and 
Southern Dynasties (1336-1392). His 
school formed the major influence of the
<pb n="146"/>
 Zen world of Japan in the Muromachi Era
 (1338-1573). The temple encountered 
fire several times. It also experienced 
temporary decline. However, Priest 
Seisetsu 誠拙 appeared at the end of the 
Edo Era (1603-1867) and reconstructed 
the monastery to consolidate the 
foundation of the present Engaku-ji. He 
maintained the austere atmosphere for 
trainees, carrying out the reform of the
 sect.
          In the Meiji Era (1868-1912), 
itinerant and laity trainees, called 
koji 居士, learned Zen under the direction
 of Imakita Kosen and his disciple Shaku
 So^en 釋宗演. The temple became the center
 of Zen in the Kanto Area. From the 
zazen course for students at Kojirin, 
outstanding men of ability appeared in 
great numbers in its long proud history.
 Engaku-ji runs zazen circles of various
 kinds and summer courses open for the 
public. Engaku-ji has eighteen branch 
temples in its site in addition to Jo^
chi-ji 淨智寺, To^kei-ｊi 東慶寺, and Zuisen-ji
　瑞泉寺 nearby.

A Chinese Maha^ya^na sutra which was 
probably written in the early eighth 
century C.E. Divided into twelve 
chapters as a series of discussions on 
meditation practice, this text deals 
with issues such as the meaning and 
origin of ignorance, sudden and gradual 
enlightenment, original Buddhahood, etc.
, all themes which were originally 
elucidated in the Awakening of Faith 起信論
. It was intended to resolve questions 
regarding doctrine and meditation for 
the earliest practitioners of the Chan 
school. The original popularization of

literally refers to a prison in the

are subject to all kinds of torture as a

activities in their prior life (such as 
violating the precepts 破戒). The original
 Indic terms of naraka and niraya (
Sanskrit and Pali) are transliterated 
into Chinese as 奈落 (那落) and 泥黎 
respectively. It is considered as one of
 the three evil destinies 三惡道 (三惡趣) five
 destinies 五趣, six destinies 六道, and ten
 realms 十界. The scriptures have 
extensive categories and lists of the 
hells, among the most well-known are the
 eight hot hells 八熱地獄 (八大地獄) and eight 
cold hells 八寒地獄 that extend between the

the mountains, deserts, below and above 
the earth. The composition of and 
relationship between the hells is 
explained in detail in such scriptures 
as the Abhidharmako/sa-bha^sya 俱舍論. As 
one might expect, this extensive theory 
of hells developed over a long period of
 time, based on numerous sources and 
influences in Indian religion. All of 
the Buddhist dictionaries listed in the 
references for this entry contain 
extensive detail regarding the lists and
 attributes of the hells.

<xa>地論</xa>
  Dilun <_-xa>十地經論</_-xa>


<xa>地論宗</xa>
  The Dilun zong: in English, the Stages
 Sect, or School of the Treatise on the 
Bhu^mis. One of the earlier schools of 
Chinese Buddhism, which was based on the
 commentary written by Vasubandhu 世親 on 
the Da/sabhu^mika-/sa^stra (Shidijing 
lun 十地經論), which also forms the 
commentary on one chapter of the Huayan 
jing　華嚴經. Ratnamati　勒那摩提 and Bodhiruci 菩
提流支 brought the manuscript of the Da/
sabhu^mi-vya^khya^na and translated it 
into Chinese during the Northern Wei 
dynasty. The Dilun school was based 
primarily on Yoga^ca^ra philosophy 瑜伽行派,
 particularly theories of the a^layavijn
~a^na 阿賴耶識. The northern branch of the 
school, represented by Bodhiruci's 
<pb n="158"/>
student Daochong 道寵, took the position 
that the storehouse consciousness is not
 real, and that buddha-nature is first 
acquired on attaining buddhahood, thus 
it is not inborn. The southern school, 
represented by Ratnamati's student 
Huiguang 慧光, saw the a^layavijn~a^na as 
real and identical with the inborn 
buddha-nature　佛性. The Huayan school　華嚴宗 
is said to have developed out of the 
southern branch, while Faxiang 法相宗　
absorbed the northern branch.

  Kyunyo (923-973), an influential Hwaom
 華嚴 scholar of the Koryo period. He 
commented prolifically on the works of 
the Chinese Huayan patriarchs, and lay 
the ground for the future rapprochement 
of Hwaom and Son by his accommodating 
attitude stance toward the latter. His 
works are an important source for modern
 scholarship in terms of identifying the
 distinctive nature of Korean Hwaom. One
 of the documents related to Kyunyo, the

<xa>大乘</xa>
  "Great vehicle." A translation of the 
Sanskrit term maha^ya^na, the name 
attached to a late Indian sectarian 
movement which was to become extremely 
influential later in East Asia. The term
 was developed together with the 
disparaging hi^naya^na 小乘, which was 
used by the former group to distinguish 
the two. In the polemical sense, the 
concept of "great vehicle" is intended 
to refer to the fact that the group 
considered their doctrines to be more 
open and universalistic in terms of 
advocating that enlightenment was 
something which was attainable by all 
sentient beings, rather than just by 
monks and nuns who practiced in the pure
 environment of the monastery. The Maha^
<pb n="176"/>
ya^na movement produced a large body of 
new sutras, in which their new model 
practitioner, the bodhisattva 菩薩, 
preached the doctrine of the emptiness 空
 of all things. The schools which 
considered themselves to be Maha^ya^na (
Ma^dhyamika 中觀派, Yoga^ca^ra 瑜伽行派, etc.) 
were to predominate in the transmission 
to East Asia, and therefore the later 
schools which were formed in East Asia 
also considered themselves as heir to 
the Maha^ya^na teachings.

is superficial compared to the situation
 when the a^layavijn~a^na 阿賴耶識 stores 
seeds of affliction. This is an

 Suba^huparipr!ccha^ (T 895) and 
Vairocana-abhisam!bodhi (T 848), and is 
indebted to yogatantras such as the 
Vajrodaya. The other version is called 
the Purification Tantra (sbyong rgyud).
Indian commentaries in Tibetan are 
authored by Buddhaguhya (To.2624; P.

<xa>大乘起信論</xa>
  The Awakening of Maha^ya^na Faith, 
attributed to A/svaghos!a; T 1665.32.
575b-583b.One of the most important 
texts of the emerging indigenous East 
Asian Maha^ya^na tradition. Written from
 the perspective of essence and function
 (tiyong 體用), this text sought to 
harmonize the two Indian-derived 
<pb n="187"/>
soteriological positions of the tatha^
gatagarbha and a^layavijn~a^na systems 
into a synthetic vision based on the One
 Mind in Two Aspects. The Awakening of 
Faith was to become one of the 
singlemost influential texts in the 
development of the East Asian style of 
Buddha-nature theory. It was studied and
 commented on repeatedly by a long list 
of East Asian scholars, including such 
luminaries as Wonhyo 元曉, Fazang 法藏 and 
Zongmi 宗密. Although its authorship is 
attributed to the Indian monk A/svaghos!
a 馬鳴, modern scholarship is fairly 
certain that the text was an indigenous 
East Asian production. In great part due
 to the commentaries by Wonhyo 元曉, the 
Awakening of Faith ended up having an 
unusually powerful influence in Korea, 
where it may be the most oft-cited text 
in the entire tradition.

six groups of mental functions outlined 
in the Abhidharmako/sa-bha^sya 俱舍論. The 
ten mental conditions for cultivation of
 goodness, which are faith, zeal, 
renunciation, conscience, shame, no 
desire, no dislike, no harm, calmness 
and self control. A general term for the
 mental function that necessarily arises
 together with all virtues. The 
characters 'great-good-ground' (dashandi
 大善地) mean 'virtue' (shanxin 善心), 
therefore the term means 'virtuous 
elements.'

(1) In Consciousness-only theory, one of
 the undefiled four wisdoms (四智) that 
one transforms the defiled mind into 
upon becoming a Buddha. It is the pure

workings of mind and mental functions 
are acting in concordance with this 
wisdom.

stra. (1) With respect to its nature (自性
異) , ordinary compassion is absence of 
<pb n="204"/>
hatred, whereas the great compassion is 
absence of ignorance. (2) With respect 
to its aspect (行相異), ordinary compassion
 takes on the form of one suffering, the
 ordinary suffering, whereas the great 
compassion takes on the form of 
threefold suffering. (3) With respect to
 its object (所緣異), ordinary compassion 
is concerned with the beings of one ka^
ma-dha^tu 欲界 only, whereas the great 
compassion is concerned with the three 
dha^tus 三界. (4) With respect to its 
sphere (bhu^mi) (依地異) , ordinary 
compassion is of the sphere of the ten 
dhya^nas: the four dhya^nas, the four 
stages cross to the four dhya^nas, 
middle and the ka^ma-bhu^mi, whereas the
 great compassion is of the sphere of 
the fourth dhya^na only. (5) With 
respect to its support (依身異) , ordinary 
compassion arises in /sra^vakas, 
pratyekabuddhas, buddhas as well as 
sentient beings (pr!thagjanas), whereas 
the great compassion arises only in the 
Buddha. (6) With respect to its 
acquisition (證得異), ordinary compassion 
is obtained through detachment from ka^
ma-dha^tu and the third dhya^na, whereas
 the great compassion is obtained 
through detachment from bhavagra only. (
<pb n="205"/>
7) With respect to its saving (others) (
救濟異), ordinary compassion only gives 
rise to the sympathy for the act of 
saving (others), whereas the great 
compassion gives rise to the sympathy 
and accomplishes the act of saving. (8) 
With respect to compassion (哀湣異), 
ordinary compassion is an unequal 
compassion, for it sympathizes only with
 beings who are suffering, whereas the 
great compassion is an equal compassion,
 turned towards beings equally. ［大毗婆沙論卷三

<xa>大方廣</xa>
  (vaipulya, maha^-vaipulya). 'Great and
 broad.' (1) A term for the true 
principle awakened to by the Buddha. In 
some Huayan interpretations, 大 means 
essence, 方 means aspects, and 廣 refers 
to function. (2) The great vaipulyas or 
sutras of Maha^ya^na. Vaipulya is 
extension, spaciousness, widespread. 
This term suggests the broadening of the
 basis of Buddhism, as found in Maha^ya^
na. The vaipulya works are styled sutras
, as the broad doctrine of universalism,
 differing from the traditional account 
of his discourses, is put into the mouth
 of the Buddha in a more universal 
aspect. (3) In the introduction to his 
commentary to the Sutra of Perfect 
Enlightenment 圓覺經, Kihwa 己和 devotes much
 energy to the explanation of this word,
 explaining da 大 to mean initial 
enlightenment, fang 方 to mean corrective
 practices with which one's 
enlightenment is enhanced and guang 廣 as

 the compassionate extension of one's

<xa>大日</xa>
  Maha^vairocana, the Buddha who is the 
center of Esoteric Buddhism, who 
<pb n="214"/>
represents the reality of the universe, 
or the embodiment of light. Transcribed 
as 摩訶毗盧遮那. <_-xa>大日如來</_-xa>


<xa>大日三部經</xa>
  The three principal texts of the cult 
of Maha^vairocana, or Esoteric Buddhism:
 the Dari jing 大日經, the Jingangding jing
 金剛頂經, and the Suxidi jing 蘇悉地經.


<xa>大日如來</xa>
  Maha^vairocana, the Buddha who is the 
central teacher and object of veneration
 in Vajraya^na Buddhism 密宗. "The Great 
Sun Buddha, is the transcendent and 
cosmocratic apotheosis of the historical
 Buddha, Sakyamuni. Under the earlier 
designation Vairocana ("the luminous one
"), he represents Buddhism's most 
profound speculation on the emptiness 
and interpenetration of all elements in 
the universe (dharmadha^tu). As Maha^
vairocana he is concretely envisaged as 
the all-encompassing lord of the cosmos 
and is the object of worship for a form 
of Tantric Buddhism that spread from 
India to Sumatra, China, Japan, and 
Tibet." (Encyclopedia of Religion, 
<pb n="215"/>
Orzech). Originally the name referred to
 the light of the sun, but later on took
 on connotations of the buddha as 
fundamental principle of the universe. 
He is one of the five buddhas 五佛 
depicted in the man!d!alas of the 
vajradha^tu and garbhadha^tu. The name 
is transcribed into Chinese as 摩訶毗盧遮那 
and 毗盧遮那佛, and is translated variously 
as 最高顯廣眼藏, 遍照王如來, 光明遍照, 大日遍照, 遍一切處, 遍照尊.


<xa>大日經</xa>
  The abbreviated title for Maha^
vairocana^bhisam!bodhi-vikurvita^dhis!t!
ha^na-vaipulyasu^tra, the Chinese 
translation of the Da piluzhena chengfo 
shénbian jiachi jing 大毗盧遮那成佛神變加持經 (T 848
.18.1-55), which became the most 
important text for the East Asian 
Vajraya^na/Tantraya^na school. This 
scripture presents the world as a stage 
on which Vairocana reveals the three 
mysteries of the Esoteric school by 
which one may discover one's innate pure
 mind of enlightenment. See entry on the
 full name of the text for further 
details.

bodhi-tantra 大日經疏 (T 1796). It was taken
 by Ennin 圓仁 to Japan, where 
subcommentaries were composed by Enchin 
圓珍 and Ninku^ 仁空. It was used mainly in 
Tendai esotericism 台密, in contrast to 
the Shingon schools, which generally 
preferred Yixing's full commentary. (

55, 7 fasc., translated by Subha^karasim
!ha 善無畏 with the assistance of Yixing 一行
 in 724; commonly abbreviated as 
Vairocana^bhisam!bodhi 大日經. The primary 
theme of this work, which is of utmost 
importance in East Asian esotericism, is
 the realization of the mind seeking 
enlightenment 菩提心. This theme is 
addressed in the opening dialogue 
between Maha^vairocana 大日如來 and an 
assembly led by Vajrapa^n!i 執金剛秘密主, who 
inquires about omniscient knowledge (
sarvajn~a^jn~a^na 一切智智). The Bhagavan 
responds that "it is caused by the mind 
which seeks enlightenment, is founded on
 sympathy for others, and culminates in 
skilful methods" (karun!a^mu^lam! 
bodhicittahetukam upa^yaparyavasa^nam 悲為
根本。菩提心為因。方便為究竟). Enlightenment is 
defined as "knowing one's mind for what 
it really is" 謂如實知自心, and subsequent 
chapters are devoted to describing the 
skilful methods 方便 for its 
<pb n="223"/>
accomplishment. Foremost among these 
methods is entrance into the man!d!ala 
born from great compassion (maha^karun!a
^garbhodbhava-man!d!ala 大悲胎藏生曼荼羅), 
described at length in chapter two, The 
Relevant Equipment 具緣品.' Later chapters 
deal with the entire gamut of esoteric 
techniques: the practice of mantras 真言, 
the fire ceremony (homa 護摩), the wheel 
of syllables (aks!a^racakra 字輪), 
meditation on the stu^pa of five cakras 
五輪塔, and so on. However, unlike many 
previous esoteric works, in this text 
such techniques are almost exclusively 
oriented towards the accomplishment (
siddhi 成就) of enlightenment rather than 
worldly goals. Many early sources for 
these esoteric practices have been 
established: for example, the three-
family (kula 部) system can be found in 
the Dha^ran!i^samuccaya 陀羅尼集經, and its 
man!d!ala is indebted to the Vajrapa^n!
yabhis!eka-tantra 金剛手灌頂續 (To.496). It is
 likely that the original text was 
composed in the mid-seventh century CE, 
when esotericism gained the status of 
legitimate "hot topic" among Buddhist 
monastics in India. while a Sanskrit 
version has never been found, fragments 
have been located in diverse sources: 
<pb n="224"/>
the Kriya^sam!graha (To.2531), the 
Indonesian Sang Hyang Kamaha^ya^nan 
Mantranaya, the Bha^vana^krama, and the 
Pradi^poddyotana.
The Chinese text is based on a 
manuscript recovered from the belongings
 of the pilgrim Wuxing 無行 (d.674), which
, as with many tantras, is said to have 
been a condensed version (laghutantra 略本
) abridged from a lengthy original (mu^
latantra 廣本) of 100,000 verses 迦陀.
An ambitious attempt at reconstructing 
the Sanskrit was made by Jiun 慈雲 (1718-
1804), who made use of citations in the 
principal Chinese commentary, the 
Darijingshu 大日經疏 (T.1796). This 
exhaustive and accessible commentary, 
along with a well-maintained ritual 
tradition, have contributed greatly to 
the text's continuing importance in the 
Japanese esoteric schools. By contrast, 
it seems to have attracted little 
attention in Tibet, where it was 
translated no later than the early ninth
 century by S/i^lendrabodhi and dPal-
brtegs. Lucid and generous commentaries 
by the eighth-century pandit Buddhaguhya
 佛密 (Sangs-rgyas-gsang-ba), such as the 
Vairocana-abhisambodhitantrapin!d!artha 
(To.2662, P.3486), were also translated 
<pb n="225"/>
into Tibetan. For scholastics such as 
mKhas-grub-rje 智法祖師 (1385-1438) the text
's most noteworthy feature is its 
advocacy of a yoga without semiosis (
animittayoga 無相三昧, mtshan ma med pa'i 
rnal byor), a practice which qualifies 
its preeminent rank among the ca^rya 行 
tantras in the Tibetan classification. 
The sequence of chapters in the Chinese 
and Tibetan editions differs slightly, 
suggesting that in later times chapters 
were reordered in accordance with 
exegetical tradition. Correspondences 
between chapter numbers are as follows: 
1-5:1-5, 6+7:6, 8-12:10-14, 13:16, 14:15
, 15-26:17-28, 27+31:29, 28-30:7-9. The 
seventh fascicle of the Chinese version 
is a ritualisation of the entire text, 
apparently composed later than the 
preceding chapters and circulated as a 
separate work in India. This short 
ritual text, the Maha^vairocana-abhisam!
bodhisambaddhapu^ja^vidhi, was also 
translated by Vajrabodhi 金剛智 as the 
Abridged Recitation Su^tra 要略念誦經 (T.849)
. For a preliminary English translation 
of the whole text, see Chikyo Yamamoto, 
Maha^vairocanasu^tra, Satapit!aka series

649c), abbr. Dainichikyo^sho 大日經疏 or 
Daisho 大疏, composed by Yixing 一行 in 725 
CE. Commentary on the first 31 chapters 
(6 fasc.) of the Vairocana-abhisam!bodhi
-tantra 大日經 (T 848). The fascicle 
numbers of the original and the 
commentary correspond as follows: 1:1-8,
 2:9-10, 3:19:13, 4:12-13, 5:14-17, 6:18
-20. Partially based on lectures given 
by S/ubha^karasi?ha 善無畏 at the time of 
its translation. A great many Sanskrit 
terms and their Chinese equivalents are 
described in detail, and Yixing supports
 doctrinal points with citations from a 
plethora of Chinese Maha^ya^na texts -- 
occasionally adding insights from his 
experience with the Tattvasam!graha 
system (T 866). These informed 
references to existing traditions, 
together with the natural authority of S
/ubha^karasi?ha's comments, contributed 
greatly to the successful adoption of 
the Vairocana-abhisam!bodhi-tantra in 
East Asia.

 translate was the complete Ratnaku^ta. 
He began, but sickness and old age 
prevented him from getting very far. 
Since the Ta p'u-sa tsang ching was the

to China, that brought his work full

<xa>天台宗</xa>
  Tiantai zong; one of the thirteen 
schools of Buddhism in China 十三宗, and 
Japan. Also called the "Lotus Sutra 
School" 法華宗.
(1) China: A Maha^ya^na school 
established by Zhiyi 智顗 of Tiantai 
mountain. Zhiyi, taking the Lotus Sutra 
法華經 as his basis, classified the other 
Buddhist sutras into five periods 五時 and
 eight types of teachings; he discussed 
<pb n="243"/>
the theory of perfect interpenetration 
of the triple truth 三諦 and taught the 
rapid attainment of Buddhahood through 
the practice of observing the mind. The 
Chinese line of transmission starts with
 Huiwen 慧文 of the Northern Chi and 
follows with Huisi 慧思. Next Zhiyi 
explained the three great scriptures of 
the school 法華三部 emphasizing both 
scriptural study and practice. The sixth
 patriarch, Jingqi 荊溪 also popularized 
the sect through his commentaries on 
these three scriptures.
(2) Korea: Tiantai was introduced to 
Korea as Ch'ont'ae a couple of times 
during earlier periods, but was not 
firmly established until the time of 
Uich'on 義天 (1055-1101) who established 
Ch'ont'ae in the Koryo as an independent
 sect. Due to Uich'on's influence, it 
came to be a major force in the world of
 Koryo Buddhism. After he returned from 
Song China in 1086, Uich'on sought to 
ease conflict between the doctrinal 教 
schools and Son 禪 schools, believing 
that the Ch'ont'ae doctrine would be 
effective to this end. Ch'ont'ae would 
eventually die out in Korea, its 
teachings being absorbed into the Chogye
 Son 曹溪tradition.
<pb n="244"/>
(3) Japan: The Tiantai teaching was 
brought to Japan by Jianshen 鑒真 in the 
middle of the 8th century, but it was 
not widely accepted. In 805, Saicho^ 最澄 
brought back the Tendai teachings from 
China and made the temple that he had 
built on Mt. Hiei 比睿山, the Enryakuji, a 
center for the study and practice of 
Tendai. However, what he had transmitted
 from China was not exclusively Tendai, 
but also included Zen 禪, Esoteric 密教 and
 Monastic Discipline 戒律 teachings. This 
tendency became more marked in the 
doctrines of his successors, such as 
Ennin 圓仁 and Enchin 圓珍. The Tendai sect 
flourished under the patronage of the 
imperial family and nobility in Japan.

is nonetheless a karma-based rebirth, 
and falls far short of the existence of 
arhats, pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas

while rebirth in a heavenly state is the
 result of a predominance of good karma,
 there is still a degree of causation by
 subtle evil. (4) The sun.

  The 'Tatha^gata is originally arisen.'

<xa>如來示教勝軍王經</xa>
  The Rulai shijiao shengjunwang jing; 
Ra^javava^daka su^tra (Sutra where Tatha
^gata Reveals Teachings to King 
Prasenajit). Translated by Xuanzang 玄奘 
in 649 at Dacien Monastery. One fascicle
, T 515.14.786-788. The Buddha teaches 
King Prasenajit how to be a good king. 
For Xuanzang this sutra probably had at 
least two implications. First, his 
Indian friend and pivotal teacher was 
also named Prasenajit 勝軍 (see Chapter 
Fifteen). King Prasenajit was Buddha's 
contemporary and alter-ego: born the 
same day as Buddha, he inherited his own
 father's throne, unlike Buddha who 
rejected his to become a mendicant; King
 Prasenajit eventually becomes Buddha's 
disciple. Second, it provided a response
 to the Chinese emperor who, due to 
military ambitions, had been pressuring 
Xuanzang for information about the 
<pb n="258"/>
territoritories to the West of China. 
The Xiyuji 西域記 was one response, 
providing detailed information on 
monasteries, geography, and customs, but
 little that would be of military use. (
cf. T 1615)


<xa>如來藏</xa>
  (tatha^gatagarbha). (1) The 'womb of 
the tatha^gata,' The 'matrix of the thus
 come one(s).' As an embryo that should 
become a Buddha, or as that 'womb' where
 the Buddha-to-be is carried. In either 
case, it does not refer simply to "mind"
, rather it is an expression that refers
 to sentient beings as the full 
embodiment of the Buddha's capability 
for existence. At the same time, 
compositionally, it is in the condition 
of being temporarily defiled by non-
inherent forces, thus it cannot be 
called "Buddha." Therefore the term 
refers to the capability for becoming a 
tatha^gata that is present in the minds 
of worldlings. The cause of tatha^
gatahood existing within sentient beings
. Thought to be the origin of the 
manifestation of all aspects of 
existence. (2) There are three meanings 
<pb n="259"/>
of the term tatha^gatagarbha: (a) the 
meaning that the absolute body of the 
tatha^gata (dharma-ka^ya) is existent 
within all living creatures; (b) the 
meaning that the tatha^gata as reality-
nature (true thusness) is a whole 
without distinctions; (c) the meaning 
that the tatha^gata exists within every 
living creature in a seed, or embryonic 
form. (3) The origin of the 
manifestation of Buddhahood. (4) The 
essence of enlightenment that is 
originally present within the minds of 
all sentient beings. The tatha^gata 
existent within the minds of people: The
 "tatha^gata has the mind of sentient 
beings as matrix, the mind of sentient 
beings has the tatha^gata as matrix, the
 mind of sentient beings has the 
multifarious virtues of the tatha^gata 
as matrix. In addition to these three 
kinds of interpretation the tatha^gata 
is called the 'mind of clear and pure 
reflection,' or The 'reality-body in the
 condition of confusion" (Dasheng qixin 
lun 起信論 , T 1666.32.576b). (5) The 
general understanding of the matrix of 
the thus-come-one' in Chinese Buddhism 
is that of the tatha^gata in the 
condition of being obscured by 
<pb n="260"/>
defilement. The Buddha hidden within us.
 (6) Despite the fact that the matrix of
 the thus-come-one is obscured in 
defilement, when the expression of its 
form is referred to, it is called the '
reality-body' (法身).

<xa>安慧</xa>
  Sthiramati; an Indian master of the 
Yoga^ca^ra school (7th century CE); 
considered in East Asia to be one of the
 ten great masters of the Consciousness-
only school. Extant works by him are the
 Treatise of Collection of Maha^ya^na-
Abhidharma 大乘阿毗達磨雜集論 (16 fascicles); the
 Extensive Treatise on the Five 
Aggregates in Maha^ya^na 大乘廣五蘊論 (one 
fascicle); and the Treatise on the 
Middle View of the Great Vehicle 大乘中觀釋論 
(18 fascicles). He is known for refuting
 the theories of Sam!ghabhadra 眾賢 
through his treatises on Abhidharmako/sa
 and Vasubandhu's Consciousness-only in 
Thirty Verses. Discoveries of Sanskrit 
texts by later scholars led to his being
 considered an important Consciousness-
only master, showing that his 
interpretations of key Yoga^ca^ra 
theories of conciousness differed 
sharply from such thinkers as Dharmapa^
la 護法. For instance, Sthiramati, who 
understood the bifurcation of 
consciousness into subject and object to
 be wholly imaginary, while Dharmapa^la 
understood that consciousness is always 
manifested in both its subjective and 
<pb n="295"/>
objective aspects. He also established 
the theory of "self witnessing aspect" (

<xa>宗密</xa>
  Zongmi (780-841), also commonly 
referred to by the monastic title of 
Guifeng 圭峰. Tang dynasty scholar-monk, 
installed as fifth patriarch of the 
Huayan schools as well as a patriarch of
 the Heze 荷澤 Chan lineage. He wrote a 
number of vitally important essays on 
the current situation of Buddhism in 
Tang China, and is one of the most 
important figures in East Asian Buddhist
 history in terms of providing modern 
scholars with a clear analysis of the 
development of Chan and Huayan and the 
general intellectual/religious climate 
<pb n="303"/>
of his times. Unlike some of his more 
radical and cryptic Chan contemporaries,
 he was a sober-minded and meticulous 
scholar who wrote extensive critical 
analyses of the various Chan and 
scholastic sects of the period, as well 
as numerous scriptural exegesis. Zongmi 
was, like many later Korean monks on 
whom he extended his influence, deeply 
interested in both the practical and 
doctrinal aspects of Buddhism, and 
especially concerned about the means of 
the harmonization of the views of those 
who tended toward exclusivity in either 
direction. Zongmi studied deeply all the
 major texts of the Chinese Buddhist 
canon of his time, specializing in those
 works with Huayan, tatha^gatagarbha and
 Chan affinities. He was deeply affected
 by Huayan thought and is famous for his
 work in the area of doctrinal 
classification, i.e., attempting to 
account of the apparent disparities in 
the Buddhist doctrines by categorizing 
them according to their specific aims. 
Although he conducted other important 
studies on texts such as the Huayan jing
 華嚴經 , Awakening of Faith 起信論, and 
Diamond Sutra 金剛經, and dealt with such 
issues as the rapprochement of the three
<pb n="304"/>
 teachings and the relationship of 
various schools of Chan, Zongmi's work 
on the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment (
Yuanjue jing 圓覺經)was the centerpiece of 
his scholarly career. His most important
 work on the sutra was his Yuanjue jing 
da shou (Great Commentary on the Sutra 
of Perfect Enlightenment 圓覺經大疏). During 
the process of finishing this work, 
Zongmi wrote a series of abridgments, 
expansions and digressions on it. Other 
noted works include the Renyuan lun (人源論
Inquiry into the Origin of Humanity; see
 Gregory (1995)) and the Chanyuan 
zhuquan jidu (禪源諸詮集都Origins of the 
Various Chan Teachings). For a full-
length study of Zongmi's thought see 
Gregory (1991).

and the Secret Vehicle 秘密乘. A later 
forming school of Buddhism, originating 
in India, and having extensive influence
 in Tibet, as well as considerable 
influence in China and Japan, but less 
in Korea. The hallmark of the school was
 a reliance on mystical formulas called 
mantra and dha^ran!i^ 陀羅尼. As the school
 developed, scriptures were written 
which focused on esoteric practices such
 as these. The term tantraya^na is 
applied due to the fact that the school 
was based on texts called tantras. 
Mantraya^na refers to the usage of 
chants and dha^ran!i^s, while vajraya^na
 refers to the dominant symbol of the 
<pb n="320"/>
school, the vajra, translated variously 
as "thunderbolt," "diamond" and "cudgel.
" The school developed its system of 
philosophy borrowing from Ma^dhyamika 中觀
派and Yoga^ca^ra 瑜伽行派. Though admitting 
the emptiness of all phenomena, 
practitioners believe that the 
phenomenal world is not to be 
disregarded but to be looked upon as a 
vehicle for progress toward liberation. 
Developing in India during the seventh 
and eight centuries under the influence 
of ritualistic Hinduism, it was 
transmitted into China during the Tang 
dynasty by S/ubha^karasim!ha, Vajrabodhi
 菩提金剛 and Amoghavajra 不空金剛. In Japan, 
the esoteric teachings were systemized 
into Shingon 真言宗 and Tendai 天台宗. For a 
study of this school in China, see Chou 
(1945).

<xa>寶藏論</xa>
  Baozang lun; 1 fasc., Attributed to 
Sengzhao 僧肇. The Baozang lun is 
stylistically and doctrinally similar to
 a number of texts associated with the 
Ox-head 牛頭 Chan lineage, notably the 
Jueguan lun, Xinxin ming 信心銘, Xin ming, 
Wuxin lun, and so on. It also appears to
 be related to a group of seventh- and 
eighth-century Daoist commentaries and 
scriptures later classified under the 
heading chongxuan ("double mystery"). 
Like the Ox-head and chongxuan materials
, the Baozang lun is a synthesis of 
Daoist 老莊 metaphysics and Buddhist 
Madhyamika 中觀派 dialectic. It is notable 
for its ruminations on concepts such as 
<pb n="334"/>
"true one" (zhen'i 真一), "point of origin
" (benji ), no-mind (wuxin 無心) etc., and
 is the locus classicus for the pairing 
of "transcendence" and "subtlety" (li 離 
and wei 微). It also contains a critique 
of Buddha invocation practices (nianfo 念
佛), and a positive reference to the 
doctrine that even insentient things 
have buddha-nature 佛性. T 1857.45.143b-
150a.

approach to Buddhist practice. In the

in that they lack the dimensions of a

<xa>心不相應行法</xa>
<pb n="387"/>
  (viprayyuktas sam!ska^ra^h, citta-
viprayukta-dharma); "elements not 
concomitant with mind (or matter)." 
Within the fourth of the five skandhas (
impulse 行) there are forces not 
associated with mental functions as well
 as forces that are. Forces that are 
associated with mental functions are 
included in the group of elements with 
that characteristic. Concerning these '
mental function' elements, the two 
skandhas of feeling and perception are 
included as separate mental functions, 
while the remaining mental functions are
 included in the skandha of impulse. 
However, within the skandha of impulse, 
elements that are not mental functions, 
such as physiological energies are 
present. Since these do not operate in 
direct association with the mind, they 
are named as such. In the theory of the 
Abhidharmako/sa school 俱舍宗, there are 
fourteen of these kinds of elements and 
they are considered to be real, while in
 Consciousness-only theory, there are 
twenty-four, and they are considered to 
be unreal. In Yoga^ca^ra, these are: 
acquisition 得, life force 命根, human 
commonality 眾同分, nature of unenlightened
 sentient being 異生性, the concentration 
<pb n="388"/>
of no conceptualization 無想定, the 
concentration of extinction 滅盡定, 無想報, 
body of name 名身, body of phrases 句身, 文身,
 birth 生, old age 老, abiding 住, 
impermanence 無常, transmigration 流轉, 定異,

第, direction 方, time 時, number 數, 
combining nature 和合性, non-combining 
nature 不和合性［大乘百法明門論T 1614.31.855b-c］


<xa>心性</xa>
  The originally pure mind of sentient 
beings, usually characterized as being 
immutable. In East Asian Maha^ya^na 
Buddhism, the mind-nature is usually 
interpreted as being equivalent to the 
Buddha-nature (citta-dharmata^). This 
term can is used extensively in a number
 of major Maha^ya^na scriptures such as 
the Nirvana Sutra 涅槃經, Sutra of Perfect 
Enlightenment 圓覺經, and Huayan jing 華嚴經, 
but appears with even more frequency in 
the works of commentators such as Wonhyo
 元曉, Fazang 法藏, Zhiyi 智顗, etc.

that are related to the mind. Mental 
functions, workings, phenomena.

is aware of it. It arises depending upon
 the "mind-king" (心王) which discerns all
 the characteristics of the environment.
 According to the Faxiang 法相 school. 
There are 51 of these, which are divided
 into six groups: (1) The five pervasive
 functions 五遍行; (2) The five separate 
realms 五別境; (3) The eleven goodnesses 十一
善; (4) The six primary afflictions 六煩惱; 
(5) The twenty secondary afflictions 隨煩惱
, and (6) the four indeterminate dharmas

  Huairang　(677-744); a Tang period Chan
 master from Qinzhou 金州 (in present-day

and he was commonly known as Nanyue 
huairang 南嶽懷讓. He became a monk at 15 
years of age, subsequently studying 
under the sixth patriarch Huineng 慧能 for
 a period of eight years. At his first 
interview with Huineng, he was asked the
 question "For what thing have you come?
", to which he answered "Just at the 
moment you define the single thing, is 
the moment you lose it" (說示一物即不中). In 
714 he moved to Banyao temple in Nanyue,
 where he remained for some 30 years. 
During this time he gained fame as a 
meditation master, such that later on a 
Chan teaching style, called "Nanyue" 
would develop. He passed away in 744 and
 was given the posthumous title of Dahui
 大慧. He had six major disciples, among 
who Mazu Daoyi 馬祖道一 and Qingyuan xingsi 
青原行思 established major lines of 
transmission of the master's methods.

  Cheng weishi lun; The "Discourse on 
the Theory of Consciousness-only." (Vijn
~aptima^trata^siddhi-/sa^stra) 10 fasc.,
 T 1585.31.1a-59a. This is mainly a 
translation by Xuanzang 玄奘 of Dharmapa^
la's 護法 commentary on the Thirty Verses 
on Consciousness-only, by Vasubandhu 世親,
 but it also includes edited 
translations of other master's works on 
the same verses. It is the primary text 
of the Faxiang 法相 school. Kuiji's 窺基 
linkage of this text with Dharmapa^la is
 problematic (see Chap. 15 in Lusthaus (
2000)). This is the only translation by 
Xuanzang that is not a direct 
translation of a text, but instead a 
selective, evaluative editorial drawing 
on several (traditionally ten) distinct 
texts. Since Kuiji aligned himself with 
this text while assuming the role of 
Xuanzang's successor, the East Asian 
<pb n="461"/>
tradition has treated the Cheng weishi 
lun as the pivotal exemplar of Xuanzang'
s teachings. Vall Poussin's French 
translation incorporates material from 
the Saeki edition and the commentaries 
by Kuiji while embedding his reading in 
a heavily idealistic interpretation. Wei
 Tat's English rendition of Vallée 
Poussin's translation omits most of Vall
ée Poussin's extensive explanatory notes
. Ganguly offers an abridged version of 
the Cheng weishi lun.

 attainment of nirvana through the 
destruction of attachment to names, 
elements, and emptiness, yet its

analytical emptiness, rather than the "
essential emptiness" of the later Maha^

jiejishenghuan 戒急乘緩 To apply great 
effort toward the precepts while 
relaxing on the polishing of wisdom. (3)
 jieshengjuji 戒乘俱急 To apply great effort
 to both. (4) jieshengjuhuan 戒乘俱緩 To be 
relaxed about both. The result of 
<pb n="472"/>
serious application to precepts is

<xa>戒律</xa>
  A compound word created out of the 
Chinese translations of the two Sanskrit
 terms /si^la 戒 and vinaya 律. {I} A 
broad term for the set of rules and 
disciplines observed by Buddhist 
<pb n="473"/>
practitioners, whether they be monks 比丘,
 nuns 比丘尼 or householders, the 
application and interpretation of which 
varies widely among the various branches
 of Buddhism. The observance of these 
rules prevents dissipation, allowing the
 practitioner to have the spiritual 
energy to pursue the path to 
enlightenment. The householder 
practitioner, declaring his/her faith in
 the three treasures, receives a set of 
five precepts 五戒 from the monks and nuns
. Before the age of 20, if a person 
wants to begin the process of becoming a
 member of the order, they choose a 
preceptor of the same sects, and from 
that preceptor, receive initiation into 
the ten precepts 十戒. If, after the age 
of 20, one wants to become a full-
fledged member of the sangha, their 
application will be examined by a 
committee of elder monks. If they are 
accepted, they are then initiated into 
the full set of precepts 具足戒, which 
usually number about 250 for men and 350
 for women.
{II} while vinaya are an integral part 
of every branch of Buddhism, as Buddhism
 worked its way into East Asia, certain 
groups of monks became specialists in 
<pb n="474"/>
the study, interpretation and 
implementation of vinaya, to the extent 
that "vinaya schools" were formed. Thus,
 in China, Korea and Japan, some monks 
are listed as being members of the 
vinaya school 戒律宗.


<xa>戒律宗</xa>
  The Jielü zong (Kor. Kyeyul chong), or
 Vinaya sect, also known in Japan simply
 as Risshu^ 律宗. This school, based on 
the Maha^ya^na vinaya was founded by 
Daoxuan 道宣, who taught that the 
observance of the precepts was the best 
path to liberation. The vinaya branch of
 Buddhist studies, especially active 
during the early periods of transmission
 of Buddhism in East Asia, the members 
of which specialized in researching and 
interpreting the Buddhist codes of 
discipline, called vinaya 戒律(see above).

<xa>戒禁取</xa>
  An imbalanced attachment to the 
precepts, wherein the practitioner 
mistakenly believes that it is the 
precepts in themselves that one can 
attain nirvana. Or, a mistaken 
attachment to the moral discipline of 
non-Buddhist sects (Skt. /si^la-vrata-
upa^da^na; Pali si^la-bbata-upa^da^na). 
This general type of attachment is also 
distinguished into the two times of "
precepts-only" attachment 獨頭戒取 and "
upside down (i.e. mistaken)" attachment 
足上戒取. <_-xa>戒禁取見</_-xa> ［成實論 T 1646.32.

<xa>戒禁取見</xa>
  The 'view of attachment to discipline.
' The mistaken view of misunderstanding 
the path of discipline, and considering

Also, the view that the austerities, 
moral practices and vows of non-Buddhist
 sects can lead one to the truth.(/si^la
-vrata-para^mar/sa-dr!s!t!i)--trying to 
seek salvation by means of the 
austerities of the non-Buddhist Indian

non-delusion 不迷亂, and that which is

<xa>所知障</xa>
  The noetic hindrances, also called "
hindrance by the known", hindrances of 
the knowable, as well as known as "
hindrances to wisdom" 智障 (jn~eya-a^varan
!a). . These are the subtle hindrances 
of cognition, based primarily on a lack 
of full penetration into the principle 
of the emptiness of elemental constructs
. In more everyday terms, it means to be
 hindered from attaining enlightenment 
by none other than our own knowledge, 
our own habituated way of knowing. That 
is, it is exactly what we think we know,
 which keeps us from enlightenment. The 
<pb n="484"/>
concept is originally developed in Yoga^
ca^ra texts such as the Yoga^ca^rabhu^mi
-/sa^stra 瑜伽師地論, Maha^ya^na-sam!
parigraha-/sa^stra 攝大乘論, etc., but can 
also be found in later East Asian works 
such as the Awakening of Faith 起信論 and 
Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment 圓覺經. 
These hindrances are taught along with 
the afflictive hindrances 二障--the 
hindrances by karmically habituated 
passions. while the afflictive 
hindrances can be mostly eliminated by 
the contemplation techniques of the 
practitioners of the two vehicles, the 
most subtle of the noetic hindrances are
 only eliminated by the advanced 
compassion and wisdom of the 
bodhisattvas. They are referred to 
together as the "two types of hindrances
." The most concentrated discussion of 
the Two Hindrances is to be found in 
Wonhyo's Doctrine of the Two Hindrances 
(Ijangui: 二障義).

itself without objects, or an objective

powerless. "緣謂攀緣, 心心所法名能緣, 境是所緣. 有彼所緣故名有

 text in the Yoga^ca^ra tradition, of 
which three translations were done into

., T 1592.31.97-112.). This is the 
earliest translation, the language of 
which is considered to be the most

Xuanzang chose to translate complete 
commentaries on the She lun 攝論 (T 1597 
and 1598), including one by Vasubandhu 世
親, before translating the root text 
indicates his purpose was to replace 
misconceptions engendered by erroneous 
ideas introduced to China by Parama^rtha
's translation. Before offering a 
different version of the text, Xuanzang 
provided authoritative commentaries 
undermining Parama^rtha's emendations. 
English translations of the versions by 
Xuanzang, Parama^rtha, and Tibetan 
versions of the tenth chapter of the 
Maha^ya^nasam!graha are in Griffiths, et

<xa>攝末歸本識</xa>
  The 'consciousness of holding the 
function and returning to the essence. '
 The third of the 'five layers of 
penetration to the principle of 
consciousness-only.' In this case the 
ideogram 末 refers to the subjective view
 (見分) and 本 refers to the witnessing 
aspect (自證分). Since this function is the
 function of the essence-aspect of 
consciousness, it is seen as essence (體)
. Also, since in the transformations of 
this essential part of consciousness 
these are the two aspects of subjective 
and objective view, these two are seen 
as function (用). Since these two views 
are not separate from the consciousness 
in itself, in the original essence of 
<pb n="527"/>
the mental function of the subject 
cognizing the object, these two 
functions are included. This is also 
called The 'relativity of substance and 
function' 體用相對.


<xa>攝相歸性</xa>
  (1) In Consciousness-only theory, 
within the reality that is the basis for
 all things and situations, all 
distinctive aspects are included; one of

manifest world are contained in non-
discriminated reality.

Parama^rtha's 真諦 translation of 
Vasubandhu's 世親 commentary on the Maha^
ya^na-sam!parigraha-/sa^stra 攝大乘論釋 (T 
1595). The Maha^ya^na-sam!graha had been
 translated before this, but after 
Parama^rtha's rendering of this 
commentary in 563, interest in the text 
heightened, bringing about a distinctive
 form of Consciousness-only 唯識 thought 
that posited a special interpretation of
 the a^laya consciousness (transcribed 
here by Parama^rtha as 阿梨耶識) and a ninth
 amala consciousness 阿摩羅識. When Xuanzang
's 玄奘 work on the Sam!graha later 
appeared (T 1597), the studies of this 
school would be absorbed into Faxiang 法相
宗.

Saimyo^ji later became the predecessor 
of a new temple called "Fukugenzan Zenko
^ko^sho^zenji" (Zenko^ji) founded by 
Hojo Tokiyori's son Tokimune. The first 
abbot was Misshitsu Shugon 密室守嚴, fifth-
generation dharma successor to Zen 
Master Daikaku, founder of Kencho^ji 
Temple. In 1380, Shogun Ashikaga 
Ujimitsu ordered his assistant Uesugi 
Norikata to promote Zenko^ji by 
constructing new buildings, expanding 
the grounds and establishing subsidiary 
temples. During his stint as third 
shogun, Ashikaga Yoshimitsu ranked Zenko
^ji first among the ten great Buddhist 
temples of the Kanto region. Meigetsu-an
, meanwhile, was changed in name to 
Meigetsu-in and designated a subsidiary 
of Zenko^ji. The main image of worship 
is Kannon Bodhisattva, the diety of 
compassion. An old collection of 
illustrations called "Meigetsuin Ezu" 
gives a glimpse of the temple in its 
heyday. Zenko^ji Temple was abolished 
soon after the Meiji Restoration (1867),
<pb n="564"/>
 and only Meigetsu-in remains to the 
present day. It belongs to the Kencho^ji
 Branch of the Rinzai Zen Sect.

 of the Japanese Pure Land school, which
 came into existence through the 
teachings of Ippen 一遍, around 1278, and 
which has the Yugyo^ji 遊行寺 as its head 
temple. "Time" 時 refers to the chanting 
of Amida's 阿彌陀 name at all times. Before
 his death, this group numbered perhaps 
<pb n="567"/>
over two hundred men and women, and 
Ippen had established rules for group 
poverty and incessant wayfaring. The 
Jishu^ practiced a distinctive dance (
odori nembutsu) celebrating the 
instantaneous salvation available in 
Amida's name. Originally spontaneous and
 ecstatic, the dance became a 
regularized performance by members of 
the Jishu^ on the grounds of shrines and
 temples, and in other public areas such
 as beaches and markets. After being 
driven out of the shogunate capital of 
Kamakura, in 1282, Ippen led the Jishu^ 
to the provinces around Kyoto. Here he 
met with great success and was even 
invited to many notable temples and 
shrines. In 1288, Ippen led his group to
 his home in Iyo and then back across 
the Inland Sea, where he died in 1289. 
The Jishu^ exists to the present day, 
with some five hundred temples 
affiliated. Scripturally, it places 
greatest emphasis on the Amita^bha-su^
tra 阿彌陀經, but also recognizes the Huayan
 jing 華嚴經 and Lotus Sutra 法華經.

<xa>智顗</xa>
  Zhiyi (538-597). Technically 
considered as the fourth patriarch, but 
actually the de-facto founder of the 
Tiantai (天台) sect in China. Zhiyi is 
famous for being the first in the 
history of Chinese Buddhism to elaborate
 a complete, critical and systematic 
classification of the Buddhist teachings
, in order to explain the seemingly 
contradictory doctrines of Buddhism. He 
is also regarded as the first major 
figure to make a significant break from 
the Indian tradition, to form an 
indigenous Chinese system. He received 
his most important influences from his 
first teacher, Nanyue Huisi 南嶽 慧思 (515-
677), a meditation master who would 
later be listed as Zhiyi's predecessor 
in the Tiantai lineage. After a period 
of study with Huisi, he spend some time 
working in the southern capital of 
Jinling, after which he retired to 
Tiantai mountain for intensive study and
 practice with a group of disciples, 
adapting the Indian meditation practice 
of zhiguan (止觀) into his sytem. Among 
his many important works are the Mohe 
zhiguan 摩訶止觀 and the Liu miaofamen 六妙法門.

 Also known as 天台大師. Among the works

<xa>最澄</xa>
  Saicho^ (767-822) the founder of the 
Japanese Tendai school 天台宗. His 
involvement with Buddhism began at the 
age of 12, when he became the disciple 
<pb n="599"/>
of Gyo^hyo^ 行表 of Kokubunji 國分寺 temple 
in o^mi 近江, receiving initial 
instruction in the disciplines of the 
Northern school of Ch'an. He formally 
entered the sangha at 14, and after 
receiving the full precepts at the age 
of 19 at To^daiji 東大寺, he moved on to Mt
. Hiei 比睿山 where he pursued the practice
 of meditation and the study of Huayan. 
But he was most enamored with the 
teachings of T'ien-t'ai, to which he 
became acquainted through the readings 
of the texts of Chih-i 智顗;. His 
reputation as a scholar-monk spread to 
the extent that he was offered the 
opportunity for a temporary travel grant
 from the emperor Kammu to study 
Buddhism in Tang China for the purpose 
of settling on a form of Buddhism 
appropriate for Japan. He embarked in 
804, in a fleet of ships which also 
carried his famous colleague Ku^kai 空海. 
In China, Saicho^ became the pupil of 
the Niutou 牛頭 Chan master Hsiao-jan 翛禪. 
He studied Tiantai under Daosui 道邃, 
Zhenyan (Jap. Shingon 真言) under Shunxiao
 順曉, none of which had yet existed as 
independent sects in Nara. He returned 
to Japan the following year, and in 806,
 officially established the Japanese 
<pb n="600"/>
Tendai sect. But although mostly 
influenced by Tendai doctrine, he also 
had, through his relationship with Ku^
kai, a strong interest in Shingon, and 
so his own system tended to be a blend 
of teachings. Saicho^ spend the 
remainder of his days in the propagation
 of his own understanding of Buddhism in
 and around the Mt. Hiei area, but 
meeting with frequent opposition from 
the earlier established schools, 
especially in regard to reforms that he 
attempted, as he sought to rationalize 
some of the Maha^ya^na ordination 
ceremonies. He wrote prolifically, some 
of his more important works being the 
Shugo kokkaisho^ 守護國界章, the Hokkeshu^ku 
法華秀句 and the Kenkai ron 顯戒論. .

<xa>有流善</xa>
  Impure goodness. <_-xa>有漏善</_-xa> ［攝大乘論 
T 1593.31.117c28］


<xa>有漏</xa>
  (1) (a^srava) Literally translated 
into Chinese as "having outflow," but is
 a term that is borrowed roughly into 
Buddhism from Jainism that referred to 
the presence of karmic accretions on the
 soul (ji^va). In Buddhism it is 
comparable to the notion of defilement 
or pollution, and thus it means "
contaminated," "defiled," or "impure," "
<pb n="611"/>
stained," "flawed," etc., synonymous 
with 染 and 煩惱. This occurrence of this 
contamination is directly associated 
with the condition of ignorance which 
allows the consciousnesses to be tricked
 by the illusions of subject and object,
 like and dislike. The enlightened mind 
is able to operate without contamination
 (無漏, ana^srava), and thus, the 
distinction between "contaminated" and "
uncontaminated" is analogous between 
that of mundane and sagely, or 
unenlightened and enlightened. (2) The 
contamination that is associated with 
the form realm (rather than the desire 
realm or formless realm); <_-xa>三漏</_-xa>

Indian drama and aesthetic writings 
there was a style of poetry called

scriptures were something not yet seen 
in the world, this word came to be used 
to term one kind of the twelve divisions
 of the Buddhist canon, the adbhuta 阿浮達磨
<pb n="619"/>
, which are accounts of miracles 
performed by the Buddha or another deity
. Also translated as 希法, 勝法, 奇特法, 未曾有法,

<xa>末那</xa>
  A transliteration of the Sanskrit 
manas, usually translated into Chinese 
as 意. In Consciousness-only theory, the 
manas is the seventh of the eighth 
consciousnesses 八識. It is regarded as 
the fundamental locus for the creation 
of mistaken views of self (我癡, 我見, 我慢) 
and the afflictions which result from 
such mistaken views. <_-xa>末那識</_-xa>


<xa>末那識</xa>
  (manas). The manas consciousness, 
which is the seventh of the eight 
<pb n="622"/>
consciousnesses 八識. One of its primary 
functions is to perceive the subjective 
position of the eighth consciousness 阿賴耶
識 and erroneously regard it as one's own
 ego, thereby creating ego attachment. 
Its basic nature is that of thought, but
 there is a difference between it and 
the sixth consciousness. Not consciously
 controllable, it is said to be a mind 
of a realm that gives rise to 
contradiction of conscious decisions, 
and to incessant self-love. Since it can
 also be called the movement of the 
human mind which sees the limits of 
human variation from within, it is 
necessary that for their basis of 
existence, humans have some fundamental 
thing that unceasingly continues and 
changes, serving as the ground for the 
sixth consciousness. For example the 
Yoga^ca^rabhu^mi-/sa^stra says: 末那任持意識令分
別轉 是故說為意識所依［瑜伽論 T 1579.30.651c4］. This 
consciousness is also called the place 
where good and evil are eternally 
accumulated, and is theorized as the 
connecting realm between the mano-
consciousness 意識 and the a^layavijn~a^na
. The so-called 'origin of delusion', it
 is also called the 'stained mind', and 
is associated with the four defilements 
<pb n="623"/>
of self-delusion (我癡), self-view (我見), 
egotism (我慢), and self-love (我愛).


<xa>本</xa>
  (1) Root, source, origin, essence, 
basis. (2) Rooted in, to find the origin
 in. (3) Book, document. (4) In Buddhist
 texts, often found in such compound 
words as "original nature" 本性, "original
 enlightenment" 本覺, or "original 
Buddhahood" 本佛, indicating the human 
mind which is in essence, undefiled and 
enlightened.


<xa>本事</xa>

  . The nirva^na of the originally pure 
self-nature. One of the four kinds of

" (prakr!ti). An originally present 
fundamental quality of something, often 
equivalent to the concept of "self-
<pb n="626"/>
nature" (自性 - Skt. svabha^va; Pali sabha
^va). Buddhism, and especially Maha^ya^
na, generally rejects the concept of an 
inherent nature as being a mistaken 
perception. But on the other hand, in 
accordance with the general Chinese 
philosophical perception of the human 
nature as being originally good, certain
 texts will allude to the mind's 
inherent purity or quiescence. For one 
discussion of original nature, see the 
Yuanjue jing 圓覺經 at T 842.17.913c.

 genre divisions of the Buddhist canon 十
二部經.


<xa>本覺</xa>
  'Innate enlightenment' or 'original 
enlightenment.' The possession by 
sentient beings of enlightenment as 
their basic nature, which means that 
enlightenment is not something to be 
<pb n="629"/>
obtained externally, or as a distant 
goal, but exists in full reality here in
 the present moment, and therefore 
sentient beings need only to awaken to 
it. This is a concept expressed commonly
 in scriptural works of East Asian 
provenance, such as the Awakening of 
Faith 起信論 and the Sutra of Perfect 
Enlightenment 圓覺經. It is due to this 
East Asian origin that there are no 
direct Indic terms indicated as sources 
for the concept, which in turn offers 
support to the argument for the East 
Asian provenance of such texts. It is in
 the Awakening of Faith in particular 
where the background of the doctrine is 
developed in detail, where it is 
explained in contrast to "initial (
actualized) enlightenment" 始覺, as 
transcending the dualistic opposition of
 enlightenment 覺 vs. non-enlightenment 不
覺. See esp. T 1666.32.576b-c.


<xa>本識</xa>
  The base consciousness--the a^laya 
consciousness 阿賴耶識. This is a

something reflected in a mirror. (2) In 
Consciousness-only theory, the medium 
within the mind for the images that are

manifestation of various objects by the 
mind and mental functions. It serves as 
the objective aspect of the eighth (a^
laya) consciousness 阿賴耶識. The "medium" 
between the sixth consciousness and the 
outside world. The variation in the 
qualities of this aspect accounts for 
the variation of the power of people's 
perception.


<xa>本際</xa>
  (koti) (1) Original reality; the 
original essence of all things. (2) The 
prior condition. Prior, already. (3) The

<xa>析空</xa>
  'analytical emptiness.' As contrasted 
to 'essential emptiness' 體空. The 
discovery of the lack of inherent 
existence in all things through the 
process of analysis.


<xa>析空觀</xa>
  The meditational practice of analyzing
 things to be empty of self-nature. I.e.
, when the compositional elements of one
 object are thoroughly analyzed, that 
object cannot be found existing in 
anyone of the elements; therefore that 
object is said to be established in name
 only, and is in reality, non-existent. 
In the same way, when the existence of 
an individual is analyzed in this way, a
 concrete or eternal self (a^tman) 
cannot be found among the compositional 
elements. Therefore there is the 
Buddhist theory that the a^tman is non-
existent. This is a view of emptiness 
prevalent in Hi^naya^na teachings.

<xa>果分可說</xa>
  In the Esoteric Teaching, the belief 
that the perfection of the 'effect 
aspect' (i.e., the Buddha-realm as the "
effect") is something that can be 
explained. This is in contrast to the 
theory that only the causal aspects of 
Buddhahood can be explained--the stages 
of practice that are regarded as the 
causes of awakening can be explained,

aspect of practice cannot be explained.

priesthood, Eisai began to study 
Buddhism at a young age, mainly the 
Tendai teachings of Mt. Hiei 比睿山. There,
 he became disillusioned with the venal 
<pb n="658"/>
agendas of the leading priests, and 
sought to travel to Song China to 
encounter the true teachings. He stayed 
less than a year, but receiving a strong
 impression, returned to Mt. Hiei 
carrying a large volume of Tendai texts.
 He later moved to Kyushu to teach and 
practice, but again traveled to the Song
 at the age of forty-seven (1187). This 
time he also attempted to travel further
 to India, but was unsuccessful due to 
political hindrances. During this second
 period, Eisai met Xuan Huaichang 虛庵懷敞, 
a master of the Huanglong 黃龍 school of 
Linji Chan and became his student. Four 
years later (1191), after received 
certification of his enlightenment from 
Huai-ch'ang, Eisai returned to Japan, 
where he established the first Zen 
temple in Japan, 聖福寺. He was able to 
work again in the Kyushu area, but due 
to the insecurities of the Mt. Hiei 
establishment he was prevented from 
teaching in the capital. Eisai responded
 by moving to Kamakura, where the newly 
founded Shogunate welcomed the prospect 
of a new, unsullied religious tradition,
 offering their full patronage, and 
supporting him in the construction of 
Kenninji 建仁寺 in Kyoto. Eisai passed away
<pb n="659"/>
 at 75, after the completion of one more
 temple, the Jufukuji 壽福寺, in Kamakura.

  (Skt. dharma, Pali dhamma). The word 
dharma is originally derived from the 
Indic root dhr, with the meaning of "
that which preserves or maintains", 
especially that which preserves or 
maintains human activity. The term has a
 wide range of meanings: (1) Custom, 
habit, standard of behavior; (2) That 
which should be done; occupation, duty, 
obligation; (3) social order, social

, quality, characteristic quality,

<pb n="719"/>
treatises of the Yoga^ca^ra school 瑜伽行派,
 which categorizes the gamut of the 
experiential world into one hundred 
types of phenomena, or elemental 
constructs. The fact that these 
constructs lack inherent existence is 
not recognized by the practitioners of 
the two vehicles 二乘, but is a 
distinctive characteristic of the 
contemplations of the bodhisattvas 菩薩. 
The lack of perception of the emptiness 
of elemental constructs is important in 
the formation of the noetic hindrances.

  (dharma-niya^mata^). (1) The condition
 or process in which all dharmas (
existences, things, mental states) are 
established. The early Sarva^stiva^dins,
<pb n="720"/>
 in attempting to explain how we can 
distinguish between past, present and 
future, had concluded that it was 
because the point of function differs 
between existences. This theory was 
further worked out in the Abhidharmako/
sa-bha^sya 俱舍論, which said that the time
 in which dharmas function is called the
 present; the time in which dharmas have
 disappeared is called the past. This 
view, if not properly analyzed, can 
result in a tendency to lead to the 
mistaken view that things are self-
established and have their own 
individual natures. Therefore this 
position was refuted by Na^ga^rjuna 龍樹 
and others. (2) "Dharma-position." A 
thing, or each thing being in its 
appropriate place in terms of its 
suchness. (3) To be a member of the 
clergy.

 (3) A person who knows the Buddhist 
teachings well. (4) A monk or nun.

emptiness.


<xa>法性宗</xa>
  Dharma-nature school. A name loosely 
applied after the fact to a system of 
study in Korea which revolved around 
issues of tatha^gatagarbha 如來藏 and a^
layavijn~a^na 阿賴耶識, but which approached
 issues from the perspective of "nature 
arising" rather than arising based on 
characteristics. Thus, a form of study 
established in contrast to that of 
Popsang 法相or "dharma-characteristic." 
The formation of this school is usually 
attributed to the influence of Wonhyo 元曉
.


<pb n="725"/>

<xa>法我見</xa>
  The view that all elemental constructs

attachment to an inherently existent 
self (人我見), but as not yet able to sever
 attachment to the view of the objective
 things as inherently existent.

Damoduoluo 達摩多羅. The first patriarch of 
<pb n="726"/>
the Sarva^stiva^da school in India, who 
probably lived around the second century
 CE. He taught that all things in the 
three worlds were truly existent and

sometimes confusion with another 
Dharmatra^ta, who apparently lived in 
India around the fourth century AD, also
 a Sarva^stiva^din. He is the putative 
author of the Zaepitan xinlun 雜阿毗曇心論.


<xa>法明</xa>
  Dharma radiance. (1) The inherent 
luminosity that is the fundamentally 
enlightened nature of all phenomena. (2)

 along with Chison Tohon 智詵道憲 Huiyang 
san 曦陽山 Son school of the Silla.


<xa>法本</xa>

The "abiding of the dharma-prince." The 
stage of producing wisdom in accordance 
with the Buddha's teaching, and being 
assured of becoming a Buddha in the 
future.


<xa>法界</xa>
  (Dharmadha^tu); 'dharma-realm, reality
-realm,' 'object-realm,' 'realm of 
thought.' Originally dharma (法) is 
derived from the Sanskrit root dhr, with
 the meaning of that which preserves or 
maintains, especially that which 
maintains human activity. Dha^tu (界 is 
derived from the masculine nominal root 
dha, which originally had the meaning of
 'element', but after becoming a 
Buddhist term, it began to take on the 
meaning of 'nature' (性). In this term, 法
 refers to the various elemental 
constructs (諸法), and 界 refers to "
marking the limits" of something. (1) 
One of the 'eighteen realms' (十八界), the 
objects of the mano-consciousness. Where
 things are thought of, therefore the 
meaning is equivalent to that of 'locus 
of mental objects' (法處). (2) Limit, 
<pb n="731"/>
border. (3) Especially in Maha^ya^na 
teaching, dharma-dha^tu refers to a 
religious basis or principle--the origin
 of all things. In this kind of teaching
, where the whole universe is taken as 
phenomena, it is understood as the 
manifestation of true thusness. 
Accordingly, this reality-realm, being 
true existence as-it-is, is equated to 
the reality-body (dharma-body) 法身 of the
 Buddha. (4) Taken as one of the 
eighteen elements in Yoga^ca^ra theory, 
it includes 82 elemental constructs from
 the categories of imperceivable 
material elemental constructs, mental 
function elemental constructs, elemental
 constructs not concomitant with mind 
and unconditioned elemental constructs. 
(5) Huayan Buddhism teaches the 
existence of four realms of reality 四法界:
 the realm of phenomena 事, realm of 
principle 理, realm of non-obstruction 
between principle and phenomena 理事無礙, 
and realm of non-obstruction between 
phenomena 事事無礙.　(6) In the Awakening of 
Faith 起信論, the dharmadha^tu is 
identified with the one mind 一心.

<xa>法相</xa>
  <_-xa>法相宗</_-xa>


<xa>法相宗</xa>
<pb n="733"/>
  The Faxiang zong, or "Dharma-character
" school. An East Asian form of the 
Indian Yoga^ca^ra 瑜伽行派 tradition. This 
school was founded in China by Hsüan-
tsang (玄奘), who, on his return from 
China, brought with him a wagonload of 
the most important Consciousness-only 
texts. These, with government support 
and many assistants, he translated into 
Chinese. His disciple Kuiji 窺基 wrote a 
number of important commentaries on the 
Consciousness-only texts and further 
developed the influence of the school in
 China. The Faxiang teachings were 
transmitted to Korea (Popsang) and Japan
 (Hosso^), where they made considerable 
impact. Although the Faxiang zong/
Popsang chong/Hosso^ shu^ tradition 
would all but die out as an independent 
sect, its Consciousness-only teachings 
made a major impact on the native East 
Asian traditions that would later 
develop, most notably Tiantai, Huayan 
and Chan Buddhism. Peter Gregory writes:
 "Faxiang is especially associated with 
the thought of Xuanzang and Kuiji, as 
unlike earlier forms of Yoga^ca^ra 
traditions in China, it rejected the 
idea of the tatha^gatagarbha and so 
denied the universal accessibility of 
<pb n="734"/>
enlightenment, and for that reason was 
only regarded as an elementary form of 
Maha^ya^na by the Huayan 華嚴 tradition. 
The term Faxiang itself was first 
applied to this tradition by the Huayan 
thinker Fazang 寶藏, who used it to 
emphasize the inferiority of Faxiang 
teachings, which only dealt with the '
phenomenal appearances of the dharmas' 
in contrast to Huayan, which dealt with 
the underlying 'nature' on which such 
phenomenal appearances were based." (
Gregory-1995: 213). <_-xa>瑜伽行派</_-xa>and 
weishi 唯識.


<xa>法相教</xa>
  (1) The teachings of the dharma-
character (Faxiang) 法相 school--the East 
Asian version of Yoga^ca^ra 瑜伽行派. This 
is characterized as a special type of 
teaching with the various doctrinal 
classification schemes, especially as 
distinguished from the prajn~a^pa^ramita
^ teachings of emptiness. ［二障義 HPC 1.
814a］(\ (2) In Zongmi's fivefold scheme 
五教, the teaching of the phenomenal 
appearances of elemental constructs.


<pb n="735"/>
<xa>法眼</xa>
  The "dharma-eye." (dharma-caks!us) (1)
 The 'dharma-eye.' ability to see the 
dharma, or all dharmas perfectly. With 
this ability the bodhisattva can save 
all sentient beings. (2) The second of 
the five levels of vision wuyan 五眼. (3) 
(885-958) Fayan, the name of an 
important Tang period Chan monk, who is 
also commonly known by the posthumous 
title of "National Teacher Qingliang" 清涼
 國師. Also known by his dharma name Wenyi
 文益. He was known as a great exponent of
 the Huayan jing 華嚴經, and is regarded in
 the Chan histories to be the founder of
 a distinct lineage, called the Fayan 
lineage, which is said to have been 
spread through the efforts of his sixty-
three disciples. His name often appears 
in the Chan gongan 公安 collections. He 
also left behind a teaching record, the 
Jinling Qingliangyuan Wenyi chanshi yulu
 金陵清涼院文益禪師語錄. (T 1991.47.588)


<xa>法空</xa>
  The emptiness of elemental constructs;
 emptiness of objective entities. 
Synonymous with 法無我. the seminal Maha^ya
^na Buddhist position that says that not
<pb n="736"/>
 only do individual beings lack inherent
 selfhood (我空), but the compositional 
elements of the world from which beings 
are comprised also lack inherent 
selfhood. (dharma-/su^nyata^). This is 
considered by Mahayanists to be a level 
of insight that distinguishes from the 
practitioners of the two vehicles, who 
are only able to perceive the emptiness 
of person 我空. In terms of the two 
hindrances 二障 in Yoga^ca^ra Buddhism, 
the insight of emptiness of elemental 
constructs is important for the removal 
of noetic hindrances 所知障. ［二障義HPC 1.792c
］


<xa>法空觀</xa>
  The meditative practice in which one 
observes the compositional elements of 
the the world to be devoid of inherent

early Tang scholar-monk, who, because of
 his great contributions to the 
development and consolidation of the

patriarch, Zhiyan 智儼. After Zhiyan's 
death in 670, he formally entered the 
sangha at T'ai-yüan-ssu 太原寺. He 
subsequently moved around among the 
various temples, spreading the Huayan 
teaching and helping in translation 
projects. He eventually became well-
known to the Tang rulership, and was a 
teacher to Empress Wu. He became a 
prolific writer and commentator, his 
<pb n="742"/>

ao 文超 and Huiyuan 慧苑. He was also the 
junior to another famous disciple of 
Zhiyan--the founder of Huayan in Korea, 
Uisang 義湘, with whom he developed a deep
 friendship, such that they continued to
 correspond long after Uisang's return 
to Silla. (4) (637-714) A Sanjie jiao 三階
教 monk originally of the Jingyu si 淨域寺; 
later appointed controller of the

the Huadu si 化度寺.


<xa>法藏部</xa>
  The Dharmagupta sect.


<xa>法蘊</xa>
  The collection of the teachings.


<xa>法處</xa>
  (dharma-a^yatana). The 'locus of 
concepts.' One of the twelve loci 十二處 in
 Consciousness-only theory. That which 
<pb n="743"/>
exists as the point of the production of
 conceptualization. The locus of 
conceptions--non-perceptory objects. "
Ideas." Non-material objects of thought.


<xa>法處所攝色</xa>
  Also expressed as duofachuse 墮法處色. In 
the doctrine of the Faxiang school, this
 refers to all material elements that 
are included as objects of the six 
senses that are not covered under the 
categories of the five faculties (五根) 
and the five object-realms (五境). That is
, there are some objects of the mind 
which are included as material elements.
 In Consciousness-only theory, five 
types are included in this group.(1) 
jiluese 極略色 The understanding of the 
atomic nature of existence of the five 
faculties, the five object realms, the 
four elements and so forth, due to the 
analysis by wisdom. This is a level of 
subtlety that can be theorized through 
analysis, but cannot be perceived by the
 sense organs. Material objects too 
small to be seen. The existence of atoms
 cannot be directly perceived by the 
five senses, but their existence can be 
inferred. (2) jise 極色 The extreme 
<pb n="744"/>
subtlety of the visible colors of the 
relative category, such as light, shadow
, brightness, dullness, and the relative
 categories of forms, such as length, 
shortness, squareness and roundness. (3)
 shousuoyin se 受所引色 Unmanifest matter 
that is created as a result of receiving
 the precepts into one's mind. <_-xa>無表色</_-xa> and <_-xa>戒體</_-xa> In the doctrine 
of the Abhidharmako/sa-bha^sya 俱舍論, this
 is simply considered as "unmanifest 
form", but in Consciousness-only, the '
seeds of goodness' that are gained as a 
result of the mental action at the time 
of receiving the precepts are taken as 
the 'essence of the precepts.' The word 
means "gained according to the reception
 of the precepts." A provisional element
. (4) dingsuoyin se 定所引色 Forms of 
magical production and transformation.' 
This is a form element where the sage in
 meditation can freely transform and 
manifest things. By thinking of water or
 fire, he can manifest water or fire. Or
 he can transform sand and soil into 
gold and silver and so forth. (5) 
bianjisuoqi se 遍計所起色 The situation of 
the sixth consciousness, unconnected to 
the other five consciousnesses, 
reflecting on the past, or giving rise 
to illusory objects, such as flowers in 
<pb n="745"/>
the sky. This form (object) is risen 
through the mistaken discriminatory 
power of the sixth consciousness.


<xa>法行</xa>
  (dharma-carana). (1) Action, practice,
 according to reality. In the Sutra of 
Perfect Enlightenment (圓覺經) 法行, as 
religious practice, refers to the direct
 practice 隨順 of the Buddha's 
enlightenment, as opposed to methods of 
gradual advancement. Thus "reality-
practice." (2) To depend upon. (3) 
Making one's own thinking accord with 
the teaching. (4) A "wheel-turner" (
dharmaca^rin).


<xa>法觀經</xa>

reality-body' is a name for absolute 
existence, the manifestation of all 
existences. The true body of reality. 
Buddha as eternal principle. The body of
 essence that is pure, possesses no 
marks of distinction, and is the same as
 emptiness. (3) One of the three bodies 
三身 of the Buddha. The Buddha's body of 
the universe-the body of truth that 
lacks form. The basis of all things. (4)
 The Dharma (teaching) as body, as 
opposed to the physical body of the 
Buddha. (5) The tatha^gatagarbha. (6) 
Four kinds of Dharma-body (<_-xa>四種法身</_-xa>. (7) In the Awakening of Faith 起信論, 
the dharmaka^ya is identified with the 
one mind. (8) According to Hakuin 白隱, 
one of the categories of ko^an. A "
reality-body ko^an" is one that makes 
clear the absolute reality-principle (
Buddha-mind) that penetrates all 
existence. (9) In Yoga^ca^ra theory, the
 reality-body possesses the pure dharma-
world, as well as the Great Perfect 
Mirror Wisdom.


<xa>法輪</xa>
  The wheel of the dharma; the wheel of 
the law. The term translated as "wheel"-
-cakra, was a kind of weapon in ancient

India. Therefore, the dharma-cakra is a 
weapon that overcomes the mistaken 
belief of non-Buddhists--the teachings

<xa>涅槃宗</xa>
  The Niepan zong, or Nirva^na Sutra 
School. One of the so-called "thirteen 
sects 十三宗" of China. This school, 
centering on the teachings contained in 
the Maha^ya^na Nirva^na-sutra 涅槃經,
advocated such doctrines as the eternal 
existence of the dharma-body 法身 and the 
presence of the buddha-nature 佛性 in all 
sentient beings. Once the Northern 
edition of the sutra arrived in Honan, 
Tao-sheng 道生, who had been criticized 
for his denouncement of icchantika 一闡提 
<pb n="764"/>
theory, was vindicated. Studies of the 
sutra then began to flourish, and the 
southern Nirvana Sutra school came into 
being. Hui-kuan postulated the teaching 
classification 判教 of five periods of 
sudden and gradual 頓漸五時, placing the 
content of the Nirvana Sutra as 
reflecting the most complete expression 
of the Buddha's instruction. The peak of
 the Nirvana school was during the 
period of the northern and southern 
courts (439-589). After the time of the 
Sui, commentarial works on the sutra 
were written by such eminent figures as 
Huiyuan 慧遠, Chi-tsang 吉藏, and Kuan-ting 
灌頂, but it began to be phased out as a 
separate entity with the appearance of 
the Samgraha 攝論宗 and Tiantai 天台宗 schools
. It almost fully disappeared during the
 T'ang, especially after the appearance 
of the Sanlun 三論宗, Faxiang 法相宗 and 
Huayan 華嚴宗 schools, but its basic 
doctrines were deeply assimilated by 
these successor traditions. The Nirvana 
school tradition was also transmitted to
 Korea and Japan, where it held 
significant influence..

泥洹經, 6 fasc., translated in the Eastern 
Qin by Buddhabhadra and Faxian 法顯 in 416
-418, T 376.12.853-899. This sutra, 
which is supposed to be the account of 
the Buddha's final sermon prior to his 
passing away, stresses the fact that all
 sentient beings possess the buddha-
nature 佛性, and that all beings, even 
icchantikas 一闡提, will become buddhas. 
The original sutra had probably been 
expanded gradually by the time Dharmaks!
ema translated it, since the text that 
Faxian had first brought home from India
 was only a small work of six fascicles,
 while Dharmaks!ema's later translation 
grew to forty fascicles. Still later, 
Huiguan 慧觀, Huiyan 慧嚴 (363-443) Xie 
lingyun 謝靈運 (385-433) et.al. of the Liu 
Song dynasty (420-79) integrated and 
amended the translations of Faxian and 
Dharmaks!ema, a single edition of thirty
-six fascicles. That version is called 
the "southern text" of the Maha^
parinirva^na-su^tra, while Dharmaks!ema'
s work is called the "northern text."

<xa>涵虛得通</xa>
<pb n="768"/>
  Hamho Tukt'ong (1376-1433). Posthumous
 name Kihwa 己和. A late Koryo-early 
Choson monk of the Son order, who was 
the leading Buddhist figure of his 
generation. Hamho was originally a 
Confucian scholar of the highest 
reputation, but he converted to Buddhism
 at the age of 21 upon the death of a 
close friend. He wandered among the 
Korean mountain monasteries, until he 
had the fortune of becoming the disciple
 of the last Korean National Teacher 
Muhak 無學. Kihwa's writings showed a 
distinctive mixture between iconoclastic
 and suddenistic Chan language, and a 
strong appreciation for the scriptural 
tradition. Thus, he took up from Chinul 
the tradition of unification of Son and 
Kyo Buddhism. Among his writings, there 
are four works in particular that made a
 deep impact on the subsequent Son 
tradition in Korea. These are: (1) his 
commentary on the Su^tra of Perfect 
Enlightenment, the Won'gakkyong hae 
sorui 圓覺經解說誼; (2) his redaction and 
subcommentary to five famous earlier 
commentaries on the Diamond Sutra, the 
Kumgang panyaparamilgyong ogahae sorui 金
剛般若波羅蜜經; (3) his subcommentary and 
redaction of the Collection of Yongjia, 
<pb n="769"/>
the Yonggajip kwaju sorui 永嘉集科注說誼. As a 
result of his fourth major work (4) the 
Hyonjong non 顯正論 Hamho distinguishes 
himself as being the primary Buddhist 
respondent to the rising Neo-Confucian 
polemic of his period, as he responds 
with vigor to the Neo-Confucian 
criticisms of Buddhism. Hamho passed 
away while residing at Chongsu-sa 淨水寺, 
located at the southern tip of Kanghwa 
Island 江華島, where his tomb can still be 
visited. For a doctoral dissertation 
which analyzes Hamho's life and works 
see Muller (1993); Hamho's commentary on
 the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment is

<xa>淨土宗</xa>
  The Jingtu zong, or Pure Land school 
of East Asian Buddhism, whose chief 
tenet is salvation by faith in Amita^bha
 阿彌陀 Buddha. The Pure Land school, which
 taught relatively simple methods of 
recitation of the Buddha's name (念佛) for
 the purpose of attaining rebirth in the
 Western Heaven (Pure Land), became the 
most popular form of Buddhism among the 
common people and lay practitioners in 
East Asia. One of the most important 
early figures in the history of the Pure
 Land school was Huiyuan 慧遠 who is 
usually associated with the founding of 
a Pure Land society in 402. The next 
important figure in the movement was 
Tanluan 曇鸞 (476-542) from near Wutai 
shan, who is credited to be the first to
 actively propagate Pure Land doctrines 
to society. The leaders considered most 
fully responsible for the spread of the 
<pb n="772"/>
school in China were Daojo 道綽 and his 
disciple Shandao 善導 (613-681). Shandao's
 principal work was the 觀無量壽佛經疏, where 
he wrote that the five main activities 
that could lead to rebirth in the Pure 
Land were (a) uttering the name of the 
Buddha (b) chanting the sutras, (c) 
meditating on the Buddha, (d) 
worshipping images of the Buddha and (e)
 singing praises of the Buddha. Later on
, the primary practices would become the
 recitation of the Buddha's name and the
 chanting of the Pure Land Sutra.
(2) The Pure Land teaching was 
transmitted to Korea as Ch'ongto chong 
during the 5-7th centuries. Korea's most
 important Buddhist scholar, Wonhyo 元曉, 
would late in his career give up his 
writing and take to the streets 
spreading the Pure Land teaching among 
the common people. Although Pure Land 
would never really become established in
 Korea as a distinct sect, its teachings
 remained popular with the common people
 throughout the history of Buddhism in 
Korea.
(3) The Pure Land sect in Japan (Jo^do 
shu^)was founded by Ho^nen 法然 in 1175, 
when he was converted to Pure Land 
Buddhism upon reading Shandao's Sanzen-
<pb n="773"/>
gi. Before this time Pure Land teachings
 had been present in Japan, but it had 
not existed as a distinct sect. Ho^nen's
 Senjaku hongan nenbutsu shu^ 選擇本願念佛集 (T
 2608) became the fundamental text of 
the Japanese Jo^do sect. In it he 
teaches that anyone who believes in 
Amita^bha's original vow and recites his
 name, will be reborn in the Pure Land. 
Ho^nen chose as the main scriptures of 
the school: the Wuliangshou jing 無量壽經, 
the GuanWuliangshou jing 觀無量壽經, the 
Amituo jing 阿彌陀經 and the Ching-t'u lun 淨
土論.

fact of its relaxing on the code of 
discipline and allowing its priests to 
marry and lead lay lifestyles, as well

Consciousness-only theory, it is one of 
the twenty-four elements not concomitant
 with mind. When this concentration is 
practiced, the mano-consciousness is 
also extinguished. Then the practitioner
 can be reborn into the Highest Heaven. 
Since this concentration has the power 
to extinguish mental functions in the 
mano consciousness, it is said to be the
 concentration practiced by sages. Since
 low-level practitioners and non-
Buddhists are afraid to extinguish their
 egos, they do not enter this 
concentration of complete extinction. It

extinguishing feeling and perception.'

 In Consciousness-only theory, one of 
the twenty-four elements not concomitant

fourteen elements not concomitant with 
mind. In Consciousness-only theory, one 
of the twenty-four elements not 
concomitant with mind. This 
concentration is also practiced by non-
Buddhists, and is called a tainted 
concentration with the nature of 
goodness. It is tainted because the mano
-consciousness is still producing self-
view.

philosophical concepts in all of 
Buddhism, and is recorded as having been
 one of the primary realizations

enlightenment experience.


<xa>無所住</xa>
  No place to abide (Tib. mi gnas pa). A

<xa>無明</xa>

 fundamental misunderstanding of reality
 that underlies all of the sufferings of
<pb n="819"/>
 unenlightened people, it is the first 
of the twelve limbs of conditioned

factual knowledge it is a basic error in
 mode of perception that prevents people
 from seeing things as they really are (
Skt. avidya^; Pali avijja^). (2) In the 
Sarva^stiva^din 有部 doctrine it is 
categorized as one of the elements of

  'Undefiled seeds' or 'seeds of no-

enlightenment produces are undefiled 
seeds. In the a^laya-vijn~a^na 阿賴耶識 
there are defiled seeds, and since the 
undefiled seeds which must also be 
stored there would become defiled by

absolute conditions separated from

Unconditioned existence. A way of 
speaking about nirva^na, etc., which is 
not subject to cause, or the principle 
of the condition of escape from 
transmigration. In contrast to '
conditioned existence' (有為法) 
unconditioned existence has the meaning 
of 'eternally existing.' In Abhidharma 
philosophy, 'conditioned' and '
unconditioned' elements are considered 
to be impermanent and eternal 
respectively, each having their own 
isolated existence. On the other hand, 
in Consciousness-only theory, both are 
seen as two aspects of the same thing, 
the true nature of conditioned existence
 being that of the absolute existence of

<xa>熏習</xa>
  "Perfumation." (1) To be permeated 
with an odor. Also written with the 
first character alone. The literal 
meaning is that of being permeated with 
an odor, and this image is used as a 
metaphor to describe the how karma works
 in the form of various undefiled and 
defiled phenomena, whereby activities, 
without fail, leave impressions on the 
consciousnesses, thus altering them. 
Thus, the meanig of receiving an 
impression, or for one thing to have an 
<pb n="854"/>
effect on another thing, especially by 
habituation. The function of one thing 
gradually being conditioned by another. 
As clothes which have been exposed to 
perfume gradually come to have that same
 smell of themselves, our own activities
 of word, thought and deed leave an 
influence on our mind. (2) In Yoga^ca^ra
 theory, unmanifest karma is sown as a "
seed" in the a^laya-vijn~a^na. That 
which is the result of this perfumation 
are called "habit energies" 習氣 (va^sana^
) which again produce new karmas. (3) In
 the Awakening of Faith 起信論, purity and 
impurity permeate each other. The 
permeation of true thusness by ignorance
 produces sam!sa^ra, while the 
permeation of ignorance by true thusness
 produces nirva^na. <_-xa>四種法熏習</_-xa>

<xa>玄奘三藏</xa>
  (600-664); "Tripitaka Master" Xuanzang
 sanzang. One of the most important 
figures in the history of scholastic 
Chinese Buddhism. A monk who lived in 
Changan 長安 at the outset of the Tang 
dynasty. He became famous for his 17 
year-long trip to India, during which he
 studied with many famous Buddhist 
masters, especially at the famous center
 of Buddhist learning in Na^landa temple
 那爛陀寺. When he returned, he brought with
 him some 657 Sanskrit texts. With the 
emperor's support, he set up a large 
translation bureau in Changan, drawing 
students and collaborators from all over
 East Asia. He is credited with the 
translation of some 1,330 fascicles of 
scriptures into Chinese. His strongest 
personal interest in Buddhism was in the
 field of Yoga^ca^ra/Consciousness-only.
 The force of his own study, translation
 and commentary of the texts of these 
traditions initiated the development of 
the Faxiang school (法相宗) in East Asia. 
Although the school itself did not 
thrive for a long time, its theories 
found their way into the doctrines of 
other more successful schools. Xuanzang'

s closest and most eminent student was 
Kuiji (窺基) who became recognized as the 
first patriarch of the Faxiang school.

studied Yoga^ca^ra doctrine 瑜伽行派. While 
in China, he studied with Zhizhou 智周 and
 also received the patronage of the Tang
 emperor. Returning to Japan, he brought
 back more than 5000 scrolls of Buddhist
 materials from China. He represents the
 fourth transmission of Hosso^ Buddhism 
into Japan. In 737 he was invested with 
the title of So^jo^.

 defined as the obstruction to correct 
awareness, the Ina-Zbility to see things

 to perceive the emptiness, or suchness,
 of things. Compared to the "phenomenal 
hindrance," the noumenal hindrance is 
more subtle, and so is considered to be 
a problem for more advanced

The definitive text of the Yoga^ca^ra 瑜伽
行派 school of Buddhism. One hundred 
fascicles, composed in India between 300
 and 350 CE; translated into Chinese by 
Xuanzang 玄奘 between 646-648 at Hongfu 
and Dacien Monasteries. In East Asia 
authorship is attributed to Maitreya 彌勒,
 but Tibetan tradition considers it to 
have been composed by Asan%ga 無著. 
Sanskrit and Tibetan version of this 
text are extant.
          In the process of explaining 
the spiritual states, practices and 
fruits incurred in the course of the 
seventeen stages leading to Buddhahood, 
the text delves deeply into discussions 
of fundamental Yoga^ca^ra concepts such 
as the a^layavijn~a^na 阿賴耶識, three 
natures 三性 and three non-natures 三無性, 
seeds 種子, perfumation 薰, the two 
hindrances 二障 and mind only 唯識. The text
 has five major divisions: the first 
division, which comprises about half the
 treatise is called the "main stages 
division" 本地分 and contains seventeen 
sections which explain three vehicle 
theory. These are:
(1) The stage of the association of the 
five consciousness and the body 五識身相應地.
(2) The stage of the mental 
<pb n="882"/>
consciousness 意地.
(3) The stage of investigation and 
analysis 有尋有伺.
(4) The stage of analysis without 
investigation 無尋唯伺地.
(5) The stage of neither investigation 
nor analysis 無尋無伺地.
(6) The stage of sama^hita 三摩呬多地.
(7) The stage of non-sama^hita 非三摩呬多地.
(8) The stage of mind 心地.
(9) The stage of no-mind 無心地.
(10) The stage of completion of that 
which is heard 聞所成地.
(11) The stage of completion of that 
which is thought 思所成地.
(12) The state of completion of that 
which is practiced 修所成地.
(13) The stage of the /sra^vaka 聲聞地.
(14) The stage of the pratyekabuddha 獨覺地
.
(15) The stage of bodhisattva 菩薩地.
(16) The stage of (nirvana with) 
remainder 有餘衣.
(17) The stage of (nirvana with) no 
remainder 無餘衣地.
The second division of the text 攝決擇分, 
comprising fascicles 51-80, is a 
discussion of the problematic points of 
the seventeen stages discussed in the 
prior section. The third division 攝釋分 (
<pb n="883"/>
fasc. 81-82) discusses the positions of 
the various sutras on these points. The 
fourth division 攝異門分 (fasc. 82-84) 
explains the name and meaning of all the
 dharmas explained in the sutras. The 
fifth and final section 攝事分 addresses 
the key points of the Buddhist teaching 
as found in the Tripitaka.
          The section on /sra^vakabhu^mi
 has been translated from a Sanskrit ms.
 into English by Wayman; other partial 
English translations, from the Tibetan 
version, include Tatz and Willis.T 1579.

<xa>瑜伽行派</xa>
  The Yoga^ca^ra ("yoga practice") 
<pb n="884"/>
school of Indian Buddhism. The founders 
of this school, Maitreyana^tha 彌勒, Asan%
ga 無著, and Vasubandhu 世親, explained a 
course of practice wherein hindrances 
were removed according to a sequence of 
stages, from which it gets its name. 
Yoga^ca^ra becomes much better known, 
however, not for its practices, but for 
its rich development in metaphysical and
 psychological theory. The Yoga^ca^ra 
thinkers took the theories of the body-
mind aggregate of sentient beings that 
had been under development in earlier 
Indian schools such as the Sarva^stiva^
da 有部, and worked them into a more fully
 articulated scheme of eight 
consciousnesses 八識, the most important 
of which was the eighth, or a^laya (
store) consciousness 阿賴耶識. The store 
consciousness was explained as the 
container for the karmic impressions (
called "seeds" 種子), received and created
 by sentient beings in the course of 
their existence. These seeds, maturing 
in the course of future circumstances, 
show much parallel to modern 
understandings of genes. Thus, the 
thinkers of this school attempted to 
explain in detail how karma actually 
operates on a concrete, personal level. 
<pb n="885"/>
Included in this development of 
consciousness theory, is the notion of 
conscious construction--that phenomena 
that are supposedly external to us 
cannot exist but in association with 
consciousness itself. This notion is 
commonly referred to as "consciousness-
only" 唯識.
          The Yoga^ca^ra school is also 
known for the development of other key 
concepts that would hold great influence
 not only within their system, but 
within all forms of later Maha^ya^na. 
These include the theory of the three 
natures 三性 of the completely real, 
dependently originated, and imaginary, 
which are understood as a Yoga^ca^ra 
response to the Ma^dhyamika 中觀派 two 
truths 二諦. Yoga^ca^ra is also the 
original source for the theory of the 
three bodies 三身 of the Buddha, and 
depending on precedents in Abhidharma 
literature, also helped to greatly 
develop the notions of categories of 
elemental constructs 百法, path theory 五位,

<xa>由旬</xa>
  A transliteration of the Sanskrit 
yojana, an Indian measure of distance. 
Depending upon the source, either seven 
or nine miles, the distance appropriate 
for one day's travel for an emperor. 
According to A.L. Basham, in his The 
Wonder that was India:
"The commonest table (of measurements), 
omitting microscopic measurements was:
8 yava (barleycorns) = 1 angula (finger'
s breadth, 3/4 of an inch)
12 angulas = 1 vitasti (span, 9 inches)
2 vitastis = 1 hasta or aratni (cubit, 
18 inches)
<pb n="899"/>
4 hastas = 1 da.n.da (rod) or dhanus (
bow, 6 feet)
2,000 dhanus = 1 kro'sa (cry) or goruta 
(cow-call, 2 1/4 miles)
4 kro'sas = 1 yojana (stage, 9 miles 
approximately)
"Though most sources give the kro/sa (in
 modern Indian languages kos) as of 2,
000 dan!d!as the Artha/sa^stra gives it 
as only 1,000, the yojana, which was the
 commonest measure of long distances in 
ancient India, being thus of only 4 1/2 
miles. It is therefore clear that there 
were at least two yojanas, and distances
 as given in texts are thus very 
unreliable. It would seem that for 
practical purposes the shorter yojana 
was more often used than the longer, 
especially in earlier times." (from an e
-mail post on Buddha-L by Joseph Crea)

  (1) To differ; to differ in nature (

<xa>異熟</xa>
  'Differing in maturation, 'changed 
through maturation;' heterogeneous (
results); or simply 'results' (due to 
various kinds of good, evil and neutral 
causes).' A term that basically 
describes an important characteristic of
 the ripening of karma into results, or 
new phenomena, in that when one thing 
produces another, the next thing that is
 produced, while having a direct and 
close relation to its cause, must also 
be something different from its cause. 
According to the particular tradition 
and text, various connotations of this 
notion are emphasized: (1) The variance 
in times and types of karmic maturation 
or fruition (Skt. vipa^ka, vaipa^kya, 
Tib. rnam par smin). The deviation of 
results (karmic fruits) in relation to 
the quality of their causes. The fact 
that good and evil fruits can seem to 
have neutral 無記, or even opposite 
<pb n="906"/>
results. (2) The separation between 
causes and their fruition through 
succeeding worlds, or time. (3) The 
results of activity; the results of 
moral intention. The various results of 
good and evil actions. (Pali: phala). (4
) "Already matured fruits" of karmic 
activity. (5)In Yoga^ca^ra usage, the 
term refers especially to the natural 
fruition of the latent power of good and
 evil activities (karma), and is used 
especially in reference to the a^
layavijn~a^na 阿賴耶識. In the Chengweishi 
lun 成唯識論, the variant maturation of the 
a^laya is distinguished from that of 
other consciousnesses, since the latter 
are actually produced from the former. ［
有部律, T vol. 23, p. 647c; 集異門論, T vol. 26
, p. 369c.; 成唯識論, T vol. 31, p. 1a.; 瑜伽論
T 1579.30.290c23］ (6) A reference to 
unenlightened activity wherein one bases
 one's activities on knowledge of 
worldly phenomena instead of knowledge 
of reality.


<xa>異熟愚</xa>
  Folly in regard to one's understanding
 of mundane phenomena, which results in 
the production of evil karma. ［對法論T 1606
<pb n="907"/>
.31.728c9］


<xa>異熟果</xa>
  The unusual or impossible case where 
the quality of the effect is different 
from that of the cause. A result which 
is of a different nature from its cause.


<xa>異熟無記</xa>
  The (non-impedimentary) morally 
neutral hindrances of heterogeneous 
result, i.e., the retribution and result
 of good and evil karma. One of the four
 kinds of non-impedimentary morally 
neutral hindrances 四無記, originally 
taught by the Sarva^stiva^dins 有部. ［瑜伽論 
T 1579.30.580b26］


<xa>異熟識</xa>
  The consciousness which brings various
 kinds of karmas to fruition. A 
connotative term for the a^laya-vijn~a^
na (vipa^ka-vijn~a^na), which contains 
the seeds and other latent karmic 
factors that produce effects within the 
seven transformed consciousnesses 轉識. 
Also <_-xa>三能變</_-xa>
<pb n="908"/>


<xa>異生</xa>
  (1) 'Worldling,''ordinary person.' The
 ideograph i 異 means to differ, or to 
vary. Therefore this term, which 
literally means "different birth," or "
different existence," is explained as (a
) the ordinary person "differing" from 
the sage, or (b) the fact that an 
ordinary person, due to his/her good and
 evil acts, is reborn into various 
existences, such as heaven, hell, hungry
 ghost, etc. (2) Worldly, profane.


<xa>異生性</xa>
  (prthagjanatva). The 'nature of 
ordinary people.' 異生 (yisheng) means 
ordinary person, or 'worldling.' (1) One
 of the 24 elements not concomitant with
 mind 心不相應行法 in Consciousness-only 
theory. From the first of the ten 
bodhisattva-ground stages, the adept 
practitioner cuts off the seeds of the 
deluded view of the three worlds, and 
possesses the undefiled saintly nature. 
Nonetheless, when a sage gives rise to 
the worldly mind and it becomes manifest
, it is not different from the mind of 
<pb n="909"/>
an ordinary person; yet the worldling 
differs from the sage in that he 
possesses the seeds of deluded view. 
This 'worldling-nature' is something 
bound to transmigration and 
provisionally based on the seeds of 
defilement. (2) The Ina-Zbility to gain 
access to the path of the sages. (3) A 
term for the seeds of defilement in 
regular people. According to 
Consciousness-only theory, in the case 
of those of bodhisattva nature and 
undetermined nature, these are the seeds
 of the two hindrances of the hindrance 
by the known and hindrance due to 
defilement, while in the case of those 
possessing the nature of /sra^vaka and 
pratyekabuddha, it refers only to the 
seeds of hindrance due to defilement.


<xa>異相</xa>
  'Difference', 'differentiation.' (1) "
changing;" One of the four stages that 
the course of all existences, from their
 arising to their extinction, are 
divided into. One of The 'four marks of 
conditioned existence' 四有為相. (2) The 
appearance, or manifestation of 
difference. When all things are each 
<pb n="910"/>
seen individually, there are discernable
 differences (<_-xa>六相</_-xa> (paraspara) 
(Lanka^vata^ra-su^tra). (3) The '
differentiated aspect' 別異相. Despite the 
fact that both the enlightened world of 
pure existences and the world of defiled
 existences produced by ignorance have 
true thusness/original enlightenment as 
their essence, illusory distinctions are
 produced through the defiled mind of 
sentient beings. Also called "
discriminated aspect", and "arising and 
ceasing aspect" (Awakening of Faith). (4
) The appearance of possessing 
characteristics (Wu-chiao chang).

Each of these five are subdivided. In 
mind (心) there are eight; in 'elements 
possessed by the mind (心所) there are 
fifty-one, among which are the five '
pervasive functions' (五遍行), the five '
special environments' (五別境), the eleven 
'good elements' (十一善), the six primary 
afflictions (根本煩惱), the twenty secondary
 afflictions (二十隨煩惱) and the four 
indeterminate elements (四不定). In the 
group of form (色) there are ten, in the 
group that are not associated with 
action, there are twenty-four, in the 
unconditioned, there are six. This 
altogether totals one hundred. The 
explanation of these elements appears in
 the Dasheng baifa mingmen lun 大乘百法明門論.

 considered as the East Asian version of
 mantraya^na/tantraya^na/vajraya^na, 
also known as the Esoteric Sect (密教、密宗).

 based largely on scriptures brought to 
China by S/ubha^karasim!ha 善無畏,

Vajrabodhi 金剛智, and his disciple 
Amoghavajra 不空. S/ubha^karasim!ha

Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra arrived in 
720 and produced two selective 
translations of the 
Sarvatathagatatattvasamgraha (T. 866, 
865). For the next fifty years the 
wonder-working abilities of these a^ca^
ryas ("teachers" 阿闍梨) and the prestige 
of their newly imported teachings 
bolstered the school until, under 
Amoghavajra and Emperor Daizong 大宗 (r. 
762-779).
     The Shingon school was established 
in Japan by Ku^kai 空海, who received the 
True Word teachings from Huiguo 惠果, and 
it was in Japan where this tradition 
become firmly established as an 
independent school, based primarily on 
the Maha^vairocana Sutra and the Vajra/

In response to the request of the 
emperor Wu of Liang 梁武帝 (r. 502-549) of 
the southern court, he came to Jiankang

 Buddhist texts as a way of bringing 
peace to a land long torn by military 
struggles. Among the 64 works in the 278

 influential scriptural texts as the 
Suvarna-prabha^sa-(uttama)-su^tra 金光明經, 
the Maha^ya^na-sam!graha 攝大乘論 and the 
Madhya^nta-vibha^ga 中邊分別論. He is also 
attributed with the translation of the 
Awakening of Maha^ya^na Faith 大乘起信論, but

<xa>知訥</xa>
  Chinul (1158-1210); Korean monk of the
 Koryo period, who is considered to be 
the most influential figure in the 
formation of Korean Son Buddhism. Chinul
 entered the world at a time when the 
sangha was in a state of crisis, in 
terms of external appearance as well as 
internal issues of doctrine. Deeply 
disturbed at the degree of corruption 
that had crept into the sangha, he 
sought to establish a new movement 
within Korean Son which he called the "
sama^dhi and prajn~a^ society" (定慧社) 
whose goal was to establish a new 
community of disciplined, pure-minded 
practitioners deep in the mountains. 
Chinul eventually accomplished this 
mission with the founding of the 
Songgwangsa monastery (松廣寺) at Mt. 
Chogye (曹溪山).
One major issue that had fermented long 
in Chinese Ch'an and which had received 
special focus from Chinul, was the 
relationship between so-called "gradual"
 漸 and "sudden" 鈍 methods in practice 
and enlightenment. Drawing upon various 
Chinese treatments of this topic, most 
importantly those by Zongmi (宗密; 780-841
) and Dahui, (大慧; 1089-1163) Chinul came
<pb n="961"/>
 up with his famous "sudden 
enlightenment followed by gradual 
practice" 頓悟漸修 dictum. From Dahui Chinul
 also incorporated the kwanhwa (觀話 "
observing the key phrase of the kong'an"
) method into his practice. This form of
 meditation is the main method taught in
 Korean Son down to modern times.
Chinul did not undergo his enlightenment
 experiences as the result of the 
classical so-called personal "mind-to-
mind transmission" between teacher and 
student as characterized in the Son 
school. Rather, each of his three 
enlightenment experiences came in 
connection with the contemplation of a 
passage in a Buddhist text. In his final
 articulation of the issue, Chinul was 
highly influenced by the explanation of 
the relationship between Son and Kyo 
provided by the Tang Huayan master Li 
Tongxuan (李通玄; 635-730). Chinul's phi^
osophical resolution of this issue 
brought a deep and lasting impact on 
Korean Buddhism. Chinul produced a 
number of important disciples who passed
 on his teaching and continued to work 
within his discourse. His major works 
include: Encouragement to Practice: The 
Compact of the Sama^dhi and Prajn~a^

  Hizo^ho^yaku T 2426.77.363-374; Gilded
 Key to the Secret Vault. The abridged (
1 fasc.) and more widely studied version
 of Ku^kai's 空海 seminal treatise, 'The 
Ten Strata of Realization' 十住心論 (T2425),
 completed in 825. It opens with a 
statement of the problem: countless 
texts of every religious inclination 
have been published and studied, and 
though we may pore over these until our 
deaths, how can we get to the root of it
 all? (內外縑緗千萬軸。。。書死、諷死、本何為。) Living 
things endure a wide range of hardships 
and it is for this reason that there are
 so many kinds of remedies, reasons Ku^
kai, who proceeds to classify these 
paths to deliverance -- synonymous with 
degrees of realization -- in ten 
ascending stages: 1. A goatlike mind 異生羝
羊心 fixated on lust and hunger 但念淫食. 2. A
 retarded yet moderate mind 愚童持薺心, 
showing an emergent tendency to be 
charitable 施心萌動. 3. An infantile mind 
which fears not, 嬰童無畏心 held by heretics 
going to heaven 外道生天. 4. A mind which 
recognises transitory aggregates but no 
permanent self, 唯蘊無我心 as articulated in 
the entire Pa^li canon 羊乘三藏. 5. A mind 
purged of karmic seeds, 拔業因種心 having 
<pb n="973"/>
mastered the twelvefold causation 修身十二. 
6. A mind interdependent with others, 
that of the Maha^ya^na, 他緣大乘身 in which 
great compassion first manifests 大悲初發. 7
. A mind aware that it is unborn, 覺心不生心 
serene from comprehending emptiness in 
an instant 心原空寂. 8. A mind which knows 
Truly the One Way 如實一道心境. 9. A mind 
utterly without self-nature 極無自性心, just 
as the water's surface has no intrinsic 
nature 水無自性. 10. The hidden and lavish 
mind 秘密莊嚴心, revealed by the way of 
mantras when conventional medicines have
 cleared the dust 顯樂拂塵、真言開庫. Ku^kai 
further identifies the ten stages with 
different religious schools and the sama
^dhi 三昧 of particular divinities, but 
reiterates that all were taught by the "
Great Awakened, the Compassionate Father
" 大覺慈父. The notion of "kinds of minds" 
draws on discussions in the first 
chapter of the Vairocana^bhisam!bodhi 大日

<xa>禪宗</xa>
  The meditational school of East Asian 
Buddhism, a comprehensive rubric for a 
wide variety of sects which developed in
 China, Vietnam, Korean and Japan. Known
 in Chinese as Chan zong, in Korean as 
Sonjong and in Japanese as Zenshu^.
The Chinese Chan school's own historical
 accounts indicate that the school was 
founded with the arrival of a somewhat 
legendary Indian monk named Bodhidharma 
達摩, ostensibly the twenty-eighth 
patriarch in a lineage that extended all
 the way back to S/a^kyamuni. 
<pb n="983"/>
Bodhidharma is recorded as having come 
to China to teach a "separate 
transmission outside of the texts" which
 "did not rely upon textuality." His 
special new form of religion was then 
transmitted to through a series of 
Chinese patriarchs, the most famous of 
whom was the Sixth Patriarch, Huineng 慧能
. It is more likely however, in terms of
 history, that Chan began to develop 
gradually in different regions of China 
as a grass-roots movement which was 
reacting to what was perceived as an 
imbalance in Chinese Buddhism towards 
the blind pursuit of textual scholarship
 with a concomitant neglect of the 
original essence of Buddhist practice--
meditation and the cultivation of the 
right view.
After the time of Huineng, Chinese Chan 
began to branch off into numerous 
different schools, each with their own 
special emphasis, but all of which kept 
the same basic focus on meditational 
practice, personal instruction and 
grounded personal experience. During the
 late Tang and the Song periods, the 
tradition truly flowered, as a wide 
number of eminent teachers, such as Mazu
 馬祖, Baijang 百丈, Yunmen 雲門 and Linji 臨濟 
<pb n="984"/>
developed specialized teaching methods, 
which would become characteristic in 
each of the "five houses" 五家 of mature 
Chinese Chan. Later on, the teaching 
styles and words of these classical 
masters were recorded in such important 
Chan texts as the Biyan lu 碧岩錄 (Blue 
Cliff Record) and the Wumen guan 無門關 (
Gateless Barrier) which would be studied
 by later generations of students down 
to the present. Chan continued to be 
influential, along with Pure Land as a 
Buddhist religious force in China, 
although some energy was lost with the 
revival of Confucianism from the Song 
onward. Chan was mostly eliminated in 
China in the modern era with the 
appearance of the People's Republic, but
 still continues to hold a significant 
following in Taiwan.
Chan was gradually transmitted into 
Korea during the late Silla period (8th 
and 9th) centuries) as Korean monks of 
predominantly Hwaom 華嚴 and Consciousness
-only 唯識 background began to travel to 
China to learn the newly developing 
tradition. The first transmission of 
Chan into Korea is attributed to a monk 
named Pomnang 法朗, but he was soon 
followed by a throng of Son students, 
<pb n="985"/>
who later returned to Korea to establish
 the "nine mountain" 九山 schools, with "
nine mountains" becoming a nickname for 
Korean Son which survives down to the 
present. Korean Son received its most 
significant impetus and consolidation 
from the Koryo monk Chinul 知訥, who 
established the Songgwangsa 松廣寺 as a new
 center of pure practice. It is from the
 time of Chinul that the predominant 
single meditational sect in Korea 
becomes the Chogye 曹溪, which survives 
down to the present in basically the 
same status. Toward the end of the Koryo
 and during the Choson period the Chogye
 school would first be combined with the
 scholarly 教 schools, and then suffer 
from persecution at the hands of a 
Confucian influenced polity. Nonetheless
, there would be a series of important 
teachers during the next several 
centuries, such as Hyegun 慧勤, T'aego 太古,
 Kihwa 己和 and Hyujong 休靜, who continued 
to developed the basic mold of Korean 
meditational Buddhism established by 
Chinul. Son continues to be practiced in
 Korea today at a number of major 
monastic centers.
Despite the fact that Japanese Buddhists
 were aware of the development of the 
<pb n="986"/>
Chan school in China from a fairly early
 date, no formal schools were 
established until the 12-13th centuries,
 when Eisai 榮西 and Do^gen 道元 established
 the Rinzai 臨濟 and So^to^ 曹洞 schools, 
respectively. The Zen movement in Japan 
was fortunate to receive the patronage 
of the growing new force in Japanese 
politics, the military bakufu, and so 
both schools developed and throve for 
several centuries. But although the 
Shogunate of the Edo period supported 
Zen as an official religion, tight 
government control of the sect limited 
its creativity. Nonetheless, the 
Japanese schools of Zen produced a 
number of significant creative teachers,
 including such figures as Ikkyu^ 一休, 
Bankei and Hakuin 白隱. There are still a 
number of famous Zen monasteries 
preserved to the modern day in Japan, 
although the number of actual practicing
 Zen monks has declined sharply.

potentialities of all mental and 
physical elemental constructs which are 
stored in the a^laya consciousness 阿賴耶識.
 Coming into existence as the result of

present activities and conditions, the 
seeds result in new potentialities, 
giving rise to continued existence which
 has a direct relationship to prior 
causes and conditions. ［成唯識論T 1585.31.8,

<xa>種子六義</xa>
  The six characteristics of seeds: (1) 
Momentariness 刹那滅. Seeds pass out of 
existence each instant, and produce 
corresponding new seeds which endure for
 one instant and then pass out of 
existence, producing corresponding new 
seeds, and so on. Seeds must be 
momentary because that which is eternal 
is incapable of producing. (2) 果俱有 Seeds
 must be simultaneous with their 
manifestations. (3) 恒隨轉 Seeds must 
function in tandem with their 
appropriate consciousness. (4) 性決定 Seeds
 must have the same moral nature as 
their manifestations. (5) 待眾緣 Seeds can 
produce their manifestations only after 
the necessary associated causes are 
present. (6) 引自果 Each seed must produce 
<pb n="995"/>
its own peculiar manifestation and no 
other. These are defined in the 
Commentary to the Summary of the Great 
Vehicle. ［攝大乘論釋 T 1597.31.329b28-c10］

<xa>空</xa>
  (1) Sky, space. (2) 'emptiness', 'non-
existence', 'voidness.' (/su^nyata^, /su
^nya); The opposite of 有--the negation 
of existence. As the rejection by the 
Buddha of this 'emptiness' being simply 
the mistaken view of 'nothingness' 虛無, 
this basic Buddhist teaching of 
emptiness is the negation of the two 
mistaken views of the acceptance of the 
real existence of a self 我, and the 
understanding of an eternal nature of 
the compositional elements (法) that make
 up the world or the self. Therefore, it
 is an 'emptiness of self and dharmas.' 
Among Hinayanists the Satyasiddhi sect 成
實宗 and in Maha^ya^na teachings the Ma^
dhyamika 中觀派 and others strongly 
emphasized this teaching. Among the 
sutras, the Prajn~a^pa^ramita^ sutras 
all especially emphasize this teaching. 
Among the various understandings of 
emptiness are 'analytical emptiness' and
 'essential emptiness', as well as 'only
<pb n="4"/>
 emptiness' and 'not-only-emptiness' and
 so forth. As the teaching of emptiness 
is originally for the destruction of the
 attachment to false view, there is also
 the meaning of 'becoming empty'--to 
break attachment.

  Annihilating; reducing to nothingness.


<xa>空如來藏</xa>

 tranquility, commonly said of the Hi^
naya^na nirva^na. (2) Completely empty. 
The reality of the lack of inherent 
existence of all things. Emptiness. (
vivikta)


<xa>空教</xa>
  The teaching that beings and elements 
both lack inherent existence. According 
to the Prajn~a^pa^ramita^ sutras, if one
<pb n="5"/>
 investigates the five skandhas, one 
discerns that the basic nature of all 
elements is that of emptiness.


<xa>空有</xa>
  Empty and existent; emptiness and 
existence. Two ways of perceiving 
reality, also translated into Chinese as
 有無. The view of existence is to see all
 phenomena as dependently originated 緣起,
 while the view of non-existence is to 
see them as originally lacking own-
nature 本來無自性. ［二障義 HPC 1.813c］

<xa>空觀</xa>
  "observing emptiness;" the meditative 
practice in which one observes the lack 
of inherent nature in all things. The 
observation of the emptiness of all 
things, based on the Buddhist principle 
that all things arise through the 
process of dependent co-origination. A 
common Maha^ya^na explanation of the 
practice of the meditation on emptiness 
is that in which the two "hi^naya^na" 
practitioners (/sra^vaka and 
pratyekabuddha), meditating on the 
emptiness of self 我空 succeed in 
overcoming the hindrances of defilement 
<pb n="8"/>
煩惱障, while bodhisattvas, contemplating 
the emptiness of dharmas as well as the 
emptiness of self 我法二空, succeed in

explanation of Tiantai specific 
connotations of this tersm.

jagr!ha 王舍城結集, the Council of Ka^/syapa 
<pb n="12"/>
迦葉結集法藏, etc. The accounts of this 
council vary, but the most standardized 
version states that the council was 
convened by Maha^ka^/syapa, with the 
intent of establishing a defined written
 canon for the Buddha's teachings. The 
two leading monks who are said to have 
assisted in coordinating this 
compilation were Upa^li 優婆離, who 
supervised the compilation of the vinaya
 collection, and a^nanda 阿難, who 
compiled the sutra collection. For a 
detailed article on this event, see the 
Encyclopedia of Religion, Buddhist 
Councils, Vol.4, p.120 (Charles Prebish)

many Abhidharma texts, such as T 1546, 
along with similar tropes, such as "

etc. ［二障義HPC 1.814a］


<xa>第三次結集</xa>
  <_-xa>第三結集</_-xa>


<xa>第三結集</xa>
  The Third Buddhist Council. (1) Said 
to have been held in Pa^t!aliputra　波吒厘 
about 250 years after the passing of S/a
^kyamuni. Some scholars have doubts 
about the historicity of this event, but
<pb n="14"/>
 Prebish tends to accept the fact that 
it at least took place (see Encyclopedia
 of Religion, vol 4, p. 121). A monk 
from Pa^t!aliputra, Maha^deva, 
questioned the notion of the absolute 
perfection of the arhat, pointing out 
the fact that he can have nocturnal 
emissions, that he is not yet free from 
ignorance, and that he still has room 
for progress on the path to 
enlightenment. Differing views on these 
points led to division of the monks into
 two camps. The council, which was 
intended to reconcile these differences,
 could only confirm the division. Those 
who affirmed these points, and who 
believed themselves to be in the 
majority, called themselves Maha^sa^m!
ghikas (Great Community 大眾部). Their 
opponents, represented by the "elders," 
who were distinguished by outstanding 
wisdom and virtue, called themselves 
Sthavira　上座部.
(2)         The Pali school of Sri Lanka
 does not recognize this council. For 
them third council refers to the so-
called synod of the Pali school of Pa^t!
aliputra that took place around 244 B.C.
E., during the reign of King A/soka　阿育王.
 The occasion for this council was a 
<pb n="15"/>
conflict between the "authentic" 
Buddhist monks and those who insisted 
that the sangha be allowed to enjoy 
certain privileges. At the urging of A/
soka, Moggaliputta Tissa convoked the 
synod, in which those monks who rejected
 his position were excluded from the 
sangha. In his work Kathavatthu 論事, 
which is included in the Abhidharma of 
the Theravada school, he refuted the 
heretical views. At this synod also, the
 entire canon was read out. Prebish also
 considers that this was definitely an 
historical event.

<pb n="16"/>


<xa>第二結集</xa>
  The Second Buddhist Council, held at 
Vai/sa^li^ 毗舍離城 about one hundred years 
after the passing away of S/a^kyamuni, 
attended by seven hundred monks. The 
second council is considerably better 
documented in the texts than the first 
and is generally recognized as a 
historical event. The cause of the 
council lay in the accusations made by 
the Sthavira 上座 monk Ya/sas 耶舍 against 
the Vrjiputraka 跋耆族 monks, who were 
engaged in ten kinds of practices that 
were not in accord with his 
understanding of the vinaya, most 
obvious of which was the reception of 
gold and silver from lay practitioners. 
The Vrjiputraka side rejected these 
claims, and a conflict resulted. The 
conflict was resolved in the course of 
this council, led by Revata, following 
the authority of the elder monk 
Sarvagamin, who ruled against the 
Vrjiputrakas on all ten counts, which 
are called the ten practices not in 
accord with the dharma 十事非法. Records of 
this council are found in both the Pali 
and Sanskrit versions of the Vinaya-
<pb n="17"/>
pitaka. The Singhalese tradition (
Therava^da) explains the schism between 
the Sthaviras and Maha^sa^m!ghikas 大眾部 
on the basis of the conflict that led to
 the convocation of this council. 
According to their version, the monks of
 Vai/sa^li^ convoked a counter council 
in which they established themselves as 
Maha^sa^m!ghikas. For a more detailed 
explanation, see Charles Prebish's 
article on "Buddhist Councils" in the 
Encyclopedia of Religion (vol. 4, p. 121
).

<xa>第四結集</xa>
  The Fourth Buddhist Council, held in 
Ka/smi^ra 迦濕彌羅國　during the first century
 BCE. This council seems to have been 
the conference of a particular school, 
the Sarva^stiva^dins 說一切有部, rather than 
a general council. It is thought to have
 been initiated from the interests of 
the Buddhist king Kanis!ka 迦膩色迦王, for 
the purpose of clarifying the Sarva^
stiva^din Abhidharma. Following the 
suggestion of the Sarva^stiva^din 
scholar Pa^r/sva 脅尊者, invitations were 
sent to all the learned Buddhists of the
 time, from whom 499 were finally chosen
<pb n="19"/>
 to attend the conference.　Great debates
 were held on various aspects of 
Buddhist doctrine, and especially on the
 Abhidharma.　The conference chairperson 
was Vasumitra　世友 (said to be assisted by

supervised the writing of the Maha^vibha

ya^na sutras. The sutra expounds the 
profound principle of Maha^ya^na as 
opposed to lesser vehicle teachings, 
focusing on the explication of the 
meaning of non-duality. A significant 
aspect of the scripture is the fact that
 it is a teaching addressed to high-
ranking Buddhist disciples through the 
mouth of the layman bodhisattva Vimalaki
^rti. There are three translations 
extant: the Weimojie suoshuo jing 維摩詰所說經
 (trans. by Kuma^raji^va 鳩摩羅什; T 475.14.
537a-557b), the Shuo wugoucheng jing 說無垢

 佛說維摩詰經 (2 fasc., trans. Lokaks!ema 支謙. 
<pb n="40"/>
T 474.14.519-536). In addition to these,
 earlier translations had been done by 
Zhiqian (223-228), Dharmaraks!a 竺法護 (308
), Upa/su^nya (545), and Jn~a^nagupta (
591). Of the three extent renditions, 
Kuma^raji^va's has traditionally been 
the most popular. Charles Luk translated
 the Kuma^raji^va version into English, 
as did Richard Robinson (unpublished); 
Robert Thurman translated from the 
Tibetan, taking advantage of Robinson's 
rendition from Chinese; Burton Watson (
1997) also translated the Kuma^raji^va 
version. Lamotte took all editions, 
including Hsüan-tsang's, into account in
 his thorough translation of Vimalaki^
rti into French (L'enseignement de 
Vimalaki^rti, 1962); his version has 
been translated into English by Sara 
Boin (PTS, 1976).

did not exist, no results or 'fruits' (
phala: 果) could come into existence. 
<pb n="50"/>
This is a basic Buddhist teaching common
 to all schools of thought--that all 
production is the result of mutually 
dependent existence. Theoretically this 
shows the impossibility of a singular, 
eternal or truly substantial existence. 
In terms of practice, the aim is, in 
making this cause and effect 
relationship clear, to release one from 
the phenomenal world (of suffering) by 
removing these causes and conditions.

  luohan is the abbreviation of aluohan 
阿羅漢, the Chinese transcription of the 
Sanskrit arhat, the name for those who 
achieve the highest realm of spiritual 
attainment in the practices of the so-
called Lesser Vehicle (xiaosheng 小乘 ), 
tradition of Buddhism. Once this realm 
is reached, all vexation ceases, and one
 is released from the cycle of rebirth 
and enters nirvana. However, according 
to the Cheng weishi lun 成唯識論, a 
translation by the eminent monk Xuanzang
 玄奘 (ca. 600-664) of the Vijn~aptima^
trata^-siddhi-/sa^stra (659), the arhat 
has attained the realm of perfect 
understanding beyond learning reached in
<pb n="60"/>
 all three vehicles (Skt. ya^na, Ch. 
sheng 乘): the /sra^vaka (shengwen 聲聞), 
the pratyeka (pizhijia or yuanjue 緣覺), 
which comprise the Hinayana, and the 
Bodhisattva (pusa 菩薩), which comprises 
the Mahayana, the so-called Greater 
Vehicle (dasheng 大乘). Therefore, arhat 
is another name for Buddhahood as well 
as one of the ten appellations for the 
rulaifo (tathagata buddha 如來佛). (For 
Buddhist technical definitions, see 
under 阿羅漢)
          According to the earliest 
sutras, S/a^kyamuni originally had only 
four great arhats remain in the world to
 propagate the dharma, one for each of 
the four directions, east, west, north, 
and south, but later sutras gradually 
added to these until there were sixteen,
 most of whom still lacked specific 
names. It was not until the early Tang 
era when Xuanzang brought back sutras 
from India and translated the Nandimitra
^vada^na (Fa zhuji 法住記) (654) that 
people first became acquainted with the 
names and exploits of the sixteen arhats
. It was then that Chinese monks 
generally began to venerate the sixteen 
lohans 十六羅漢 and that pictures and 
statues representing them dressed in a 
<pb n="61"/>
wide variety of Chinese monks' attire 
appeared continuously and in great 
numbers all over China. For example, 
Wang Wei (701-761) is recorded to have 
painted forty-eight pictures of the 
sixteen lohans, and paintings of them by
 Lu Lengjia (active ca. 730-760) and 
others became famous throughout the Tang
 empire. Statues of the sixteen lohans 
made then for the Yanxiadong (Clouds and
 Mist Grotto) in Hangzhou were praised 
throughout subsequent ages. Beginning 
with the Song era, representations of 
the sixteen lohans gradually ceased to 
enjoy such popularity as a subject in 
Buddhist sculpture, but painters still 
often painted pictures of them through 
the end of the Ming era, including Li 
Gonglin (ca. 1049-1106), Liang Kai (
early thirteenth century), Zhao Mengfu (
1254-1322), and Chiu Ying (ca. 1494-ca. 
1552).
          Beginning with the Five 
Dynasties era, veneration for lohans 
flourished, and in painting the number 
depicted increased to eighteen 十八羅漢. 
When Su Shi (1037-1101) was exiled to 
Hainan Island, he once saw a Shiba 
luohan tu (Picture of the Eighteen 
Lohans) by the Five Dynasties era 
<pb n="62"/>
painter Zhang Xuan (active ca. 890-930) 
of the Former Shu kingdom (907-925), 
which inspired him to compose a Shiba 
daluohan song (Hymn to the Eighteen 
Great Lohans). Later, at the Baolin si 
he saw another such painting, which 
prompted another composition, Zi Hainan 
gui guo Qingyuanxia Baolinsi jingzan 
Chanyue suohua shiba daluohan (Returning
 from Hainan, I Stopped by at Baolin 
Temple in the Qingyuan Gorge to Pay My 
Respects to The Eighteen Great Lohans?¨ 
by the Monk Chanyue). Both of Su's 
compositions describe the appearance and
 provide the names of the eighteen 
lohans, with Qingyou 慶友 and Bintoulu 賓頭盧
 the two additional figures. After this,
 the eighteen lohans became an 
increasingly popular subject in both 
sculpture and painting. At temples 
statues of them were placed on the east 
and west sides of Daxiong baodian where 
they served as guardians for figures of 
S/a^kyamuni or of the Past, Present, and
 Future Buddhas.
          Five Hundred Lohans 五百羅漢 is a 
collective name often mentioned in 
sutras, where it is sometimes identified
 with the five hundred bhiks!us (五百比丘) 
and the five hundred (shangshou). Many 
<pb n="63"/>
legends concerning the five hundred also
 exist, for example, in the Fahua jing 
Wubai dizi shoujipin (The Five Hundred 
Disciples Undergo vya^karan!a 授記 (the 
Buddha's foretelling when each one shall
 Enter Nirvana)) section of the 
Fahuajing (Lotus Sutra), the Sheli fo 
wen jing, where it is told that after 
King Fushamiduolou destroys Buddhism, 
the Five Hundred Lohans reestablish it. 
The Fa zhuji records that each of the 
sixteen lohans is responsible for a 
certain territory of operations and that
 each has a staff of subordinates, five 
hundred lohans being the elementary unit
. Also, it is said that after the 
parinirva^n!a of S/a^kyamuni, Maha^ka^/
syapa 迦葉 together with five hundred 
lohans made the first collection of the 
scriptures at Ra^jagr!ha 王舍城. At the 
time of King A/soka, five hundred lohan 
monks and five hundred ordinary (凡夫, i. 
e. still unenlightened), monks assembled
 en masse to chant the Buddha's 
teachings. During the Fourth Council 第四結
集 at the time of King Kanis!ka, five 
hundred lohans also assembled to compose
 the Da piposha lun 大毗婆沙論. "Five hundred
" in such narratives surely stands for "
several hundred" and does not signify a 
<pb n="64"/>
definite number. Also, none of these 
accounts provide individual names for 
the five hundred lohans. We know that it
 was during the Tang era that the five 
hundred lohans were first represented in
 China. According to the Wudai minghua 
buyi (Supplement to Famous Paintings of 
the Five Dynasties Era), the prominent 
Tang era sculptor Yang Huizhi made 
figures of the five hundred lohans for 
the Guang'ai si in Hunan prefecture, 
which is the earliest known occurrence 
of sculptures of the five hundred lohans
 in China. During the Five Dynasties era
 veneration of the five hundred lohans 
became very popular. For example, the 
King of the Wu-Yue state (907-978), Qian
 Liu, had bronze statutes of the five 
hundred lohans made for the Fangguang si
 on Mount Tiantai, and, in the first 
year of the Xiande era (954), Chan 
master Daoqian received permission from 
Qian Zhongyi, then King of Wu-Yue, to 
move sixteen statues of the Buddha?'s 
disciples from the base of Thunder Peak 
Pagoda to the Jingci Temple and to have 
a Five Hundred Lohan Hall built there--
both sites in Hangzhou, the Wu-Yue 
capital. In the second year of Yongxi 
era of the Northern Song (985?), statues
<pb n="65"/>
 of five hundred sixteen lohans were 
made and placed in the Shouchang Temple 
on Mount Tiantai. In fact, during the 
Northern Song era, veneration of the 
five hundred lohans became increasingly 
popular, and throughout China many 
temples had halls constructed to hold 
statues of them, sparing no expense. 
Grottos to contain groups of the five 
hundred also began to appear, for 
example, the one hundred sixty-eighth 
cave at Dazu, Sichuan, which comprises 
the Dafo an, where the central wall and 
two side walls had lohans carved all 
over them.
          However, these places where 
the five hundred lohans were represented
 all failed to provide names for them. 
According to an entry in the Baoke 
congbian, juan 15, in the guisi year of 
Dahe era (933?), Dade chongyi composed 
Wu Longxing si Chongfu yuan wubai luohan
 bei (Five Hundred Lohan Stele at the 
Longxing Temple, Chongfu Sub-temple, in 
Wu (Xuanzhou)), each identified with an 
individual name, but this stele did not 
survive. For a slightly later period, 
the Jinshixubian, juan 17, contains a 
copy of a stele inscribed in the fourth 
year of the Shaoxing era of the Southern
<pb n="66"/>
 Song (1134), which Gao Daosu, who was a
 yuanwailang in the gongbu, had composed
 by collecting all available Buddhist 
writings and abstracting from them the 
names of five hundred lohans. This stele
 was erected in the Qianming Temple at 
Jiangyin--the renowned Jiangyinjun 
Qianmingyuan luohan zunhao bei (Stone 
Inscription of the Venerable Names of 
Lohans at the Qianming Temple of 
Jiangyin Commandery). Although this is 
the earliest such record of the names of
 the lohans known in China, it is just a
 list of "venerable names" (zunhao)--no 
illustrations of the lohan figures 
themselves were engraved. However, from 
this time on, all temples that had five 
hundred lohan halls constructed and all 
painters who made pictures of them named
 the lohans according to this list. 
During the Chongzhen era of the Ming, 
Gao Chengyan had the Qianmingyuan luohan
 zunhao bei engraved again, and his son,
 Gao Youji, had it re-engraved a second 
time and copied into the Jiaxing zang, 
where it is contained in case (han) 43. 
However, it still only contains the 
names of the lohans.
          Still during the Southern Sung
 era, someone compiled a collection of 
<pb n="67"/>
illustrations and produced a wood block 
edition of a Luohan tulu (Catalogue of 
Pictures of Lohans)--the first known 
illustrated catalogue of the lohans. 
This work was reprinted from new wood 
blocks in the sixteenth year of the 
Chongzhen era (1643). Although no copies
 of this work now survive, it was 
reprinted again from a new set of wood 
blocks in the fifty-second year of the 
Qianlong era (1787)--the Qianming yuan 
wubaishiba aluohan tulu (Catalogue of 
Illustrations of the Five Hundred 
Eighteen Lohans From the Qianming Temple
), under the direction of Abbot Dache, 
an eminent priest of the Qianlong era. 
The Qianming yuan or Luohan si is 
located in present-day Shifang district,
 Chongqing, Siquan. First built in the 
Song, it fell into disrepair during the 
Yuan and Ming era but was rebuilt in the
 seventeenth year of the Qianlong era (
1752), and some time after that statues 
of the five hundred eighteen lohans were
 made, after the illustrations in the 
Ming edition of the Luohan tulu. The 
temple was destroyed during wartime 
Japanese air raids and was rebuilt in 
1945, new statues filling the Lohan Hall
 once again.

  Uich'on (1055-1101); one of the major

His major area of expertise was in Hwaom
 華嚴, but he ended up becoming most 
famous for being a transmitter of the Ch
'ont'ae 天台 tradition in Korea. He was 
one of the Koryo's most famous advocates
 of Son/Kyo unity. Uich'on was the 
fourth son of a devout Buddhist king, 
and entered the sangha at a young age. 
Like most other early Koryo monks, he 
began his studies in Buddhism with Hwaom
. He later traveled to China, where he 
studied under a number of leading 
masters from a variety of lineages, 
including Ch'an 禪宗, Hua-yen, Vinaya 戒律, 
Pure Land 淨土 and Tiantai. Returning to 
Korea, Uich'on very actively spread the 
Ch'ont'ae teaching, believing that it, 
as a balanced system, provided a viable 
solution to the heated Son/Kyo debate 
which surrounded him at the time. 
Ultimately, however, his negative 
attitude towards Son undermined his 
efforts to accommodate Son adherents, 
and he died fairly young without 
accomplishing his mission. His main 
writings are contained in the Taegak 
kuksa munjip 大覺國師文集, and he is also

of Buddhist texts, which have been an

of "seeds" --i.e. karmic impressions 
which help to comprise the total 
character of the individual entity. 
Habit energies are distinguished from 
seeds by virtue of the fact that they 
are the traces that remain even after 
destroying the seeds existent in the a^
laya-vijn~a^na. According to the Yoga^ca
^ra school, the seeds and the habituated
 energies are removed during the period 
from the first bhu^mi until the tenth. 
These energies are fully eliminated only
 upon the attainment of Buddhahood, and 
therefore, as hindrances to liberation, 
are considered to be the most subtle, as
 all of the other hindrances proper of 
affliction and noesis can be eliminated 
at advanced bodhisattva stages. (Skt. va

Although not surviving as a distinct

Buddhism, the reason such "powers" are

possible is not because of the 
development of great personal power on 
the part of a buddha, but because of his
 or her realization of the world to be 
completely interpenetrated (通). Thus, 
the unhindered function of a buddha is

changes and decays, has the quality of 
shape and mutual obstruction. The 
Sanskrit root of the word ru^pa, rup, is
 a verb which means to have form, 
therefore the primary meaning of '
something which has form.' It is 
understood as something created by 
forming (Skt. ru^pyata iti ru^pam). It 
also has the meaning of the verbal root 
ru, meaning decay, or break down, and 
therefore, something which decays or 
breaks down, or changes. It is a word 
which refers to a material object which 
has shape, is formed or created, and 
changes. It is understood with the 
meaning of zhiai 質礙 "materially 
obstructing," and bianhuai 變壞, "changing
 and decaying," both of which are the 
nature of all that possesses form. Other
 technical usages of the term include 
the meanings of (1) color, colorful (Skt
<pb n="128"/>
. varna, citra, ranga); (2) color and 
form; that is, as an object of the eye 
consciousness. That which can be seen by
 the eye. All material existence, 
possessing form. The objects of the 
faculties of perception, so not simply 
color, but color and form together.

the 'six data-fields' or six objects of 
consciousness. Also has the meaning of '
form realm' (色界). In the Abhidharmako/sa
 school, 色 is also interpreted as 顯色, 
that is, visible color as opposed to 形 (
xing) which means visible shape. (3) In 
the doctrine of the Yogacara school 瑜伽行派
, one of the five categories of elements
 within the group of form elements (色法).

object realms (五境), it is the object-
realm of the faculty of sight.

as a school.

<pb n="143"/>

<xa>華嚴宗</xa>
  The Huayan zong school, one of the 
major schools of Chinese Buddhism, the 
doctrines of which ended up having 
profound impact on the philosophical 
attitudes of all of East Asian Buddhism.
 Established during the period of the 
end of the Sui and beginning of Tang 
dynasties, this school centered on the 
philosophy of interpenetration and 
mutual containment which its founders 
perceived in the Huayan jing 華嚴經. Yet 
despite basic reliance on this sutra, 
much of the technical terminology that 
the school becomes famous for is not 
found in the sutra itself, but in the 
commentarial works of its early founders
. The founding of the school is 
traditionally attributed to a series of 
five "patriarchs" who were instrumental 
in developing the schools doctrines. 
These five are: Dushun 杜順, Zhiyan 智儼, 
Fazang 法藏, Chengguan 澄觀 and Zongmi 宗密. 
Another important figure in the 
development and popularization of Huayan
 thought was the lay scholar Li Tongxuan
 李通玄. Some accounts of the school also 
like to extend its patriarchship earlier
 to A/svaghos!a 馬鳴 and Na^ga^rjuna 龍樹. 
<pb n="144"/>
Although there are certain aspects of 
this patriarchal scheme which are 
clearly contrived, it is fairly well 
accepted that these men each played a 
significant and distinct role in the 
development of the school: for example, 
Dushun is known to have been responsible
 for the establishment of Huayan studies
 as a distinct field; Zhiyan is 
considered to have established the basic
 doctrines of the sect; Fazang is 
considered to have rationalized the 
doctrine for greater acceptance by 
society; Chengguan and Zongmi are 
understood to have further developed and
 transformed the teachings. After the 
time of Zongmi and Li Tongxuan the 
Chinese school of Huayan generally 
stagnated in terms of new development, 
and then eventually began to decline. 
The school, which had been dependent 
upon the support it received from the 
government, suffered severely during the
 purge of 841-5, never to recover its 
former strength. Nonetheless, its 
profound metaphysics, such as that of 
the four dharmadha^tu 四法界 of 
interpenetration, had a deep impact on 
surviving East Asian schools, especially
 the Chan school.
<pb n="145"/>
The greatest lasting impact of the 
Huayan school was to be seen in Korea, 
where it was transmitted by Uisang 義湘, 
who had been, along with Fazang, a 
student of Zhiyan. After Uisang returned
 to Korea in 671, he worked vigorously 
toward the establishment of the Hwaom 
school on the peninsula. In this effort,
 he was greatly aided by the powerful 
influences of his friend Wonhyo 元曉, who 
although not an official representative 
of the school, relied deeply on Hwaom 
metaphysical principles to establish his
 concept of "interpenetrated Buddhism 通佛
教." After the passing of these two early
 monks, the Hwaom school became strongly
 established under the influence of a 
long series of Hwaom masters. The Hwaom 
school remained in the position of 
predominant doctrinal school in Korea up
 till the end of the Koryo period, when 
it was placed into a forced merger with 
the Son school 禪宗. Within the Son school
, Hwaom thought would continue to play a
 strong role, and continues as such to 
modern times.
Huayan studies were founded in Japan 
when, in 736, the scholar-priest Ro^ben 
良辯 (originally a Hosso^ 法相 specialist) 
invited the Korean Simsang 審祥 to give 
<pb n="146"/>
lectures on the Huayan jing at Konshu-ji
 金鍾寺. When the construction of To^daiji 
東大寺 was completed, Ro^ben entered that 
temple to formally initiate Kegon as a 
field of study in Japanese Buddhism, and
 the Kegon shu^ would become known as 
one of the "six Nara 奈良 schools." Kegon 
thought was later be popularized in 
Japan by Myo^e 明惠, who combined its 
doctrines with those of the esoteric 
school 密教, and Gyo^nen 凝然, who is most 
responsible for the establishment of the
 To^daiji lineage of Kegon.
The most important philosophical 
contributions of the Huayan school were 
in the area of its metaphysics, as it 
taught the doctrine of the mutual 
containment and interpenetration of all 
phenomena shishiwuai 事事無礙: that one 
thing contains all things in existence, 
and that all things contain one.

Chinese translations were done, all with

huayanjing 大方廣佛華嚴經. This text describes 
a cosmos of infinite realms upon realms,
 mutually containing each other. The 
vision expressed in this work was the 
foundation for the creation of a the 
Huayan school 華嚴宗 of Buddhism, which was
 characterized by a philosophy of 
interpenetration (通達、圓融). The sutra is 
also well known for its detail 
description of the course of the course 
of the bodhisattva's practice through 
fifty-two stages. Fragmentary 
translation of this text probably began 
in the second century, and the famous "
Ten Stages" 十地經 book, often treated as 
an individual scripture, was first 
translated in the third century. The

<xa>菩提樹</xa>
  (bodhi-druma) 'bodhi-tree.' (1) The 
tree underneath which S/a^kyamuni Buddha
 attained enlightenment. The original 
Sanskrit name of the tree was pippala or
 asvattha. Since Vedic times, it was 
known as a tree that possessed spiritual
 power. (2) A term for awakening or 
enlightenment.


<xa>菩提流支</xa>
  (1) (?-527) Bodhiruci, one of the most
 prolific translators of Sanskrit 
Buddhist texts into Chinese. His name is
 also transliterated as 菩提留支 and 
translated according to its meaning as 
Daoxi 道希. He was originally from 
northern India, and after settling down 
<pb n="154"/>
in the Northern Wei capital of Loyang, 
completed the translation of over thirty
 Maha^ya^na sutras and treatises. Most 
of these were reflective of the latest 
developments in Indian Maha^ya^na, most 
importantly Consciousness-only related 
works, and these translations ended up 
having a major impact on East Asian 
Buddhism from this time. Among the most 
important of these were the Lanka^vata^
ra Sutra 入楞伽經, Jingang panruo jing (
Diamond Sutra) 金剛般若經、 Foming jing 佛名經、 
Faji jing 法集經、 Shenmi jietuo jing 深密解脫經,
 Dabao jijing lun 大寶積經論, Fahuajing lun 法
華經論, and the Wuliang shoujing lun (
Treatise on the Sutra of Infinite Life) 
無量壽經論.
The northern branch of the Ten Stages 
sect 地論宗 was formed based on his 
translation and studies of the Treatise 
on the Book of the Ten Stages 十地經論. 
Danluan 曇鸞, one of the early founders of
 the Pure Land School 淨土宗, based many of
 his ideas on Bodhiruci's translation of
 the Treatise on the Sutra of Infinite 
Life. One of his most important 
colleagues was Ratnamati 勒那摩提, who 
worked together with him on the Dilun. 
Based on the differing interpretations 
of the two regarding key doctrines 
<pb n="155"/>
contained in this, the Dilun school 
developed into two branches of northern,
 started by Bodhiruci's disciple 
Daochong 道寵 and the southern, 
represented by Ratnamati's student 
Huiguang 慧光. (2) There was also a 
Bodhiruci who came to Loyang during the 
Tang, who served as a translator under 
the reign of empress Wu.

<xa>菩提達磨</xa>
  Bodhidharma (d. 536?) the putative 
founder of the Chan school 禪宗in China. 
He is said to have come from India to 
teach the direct transmission from mind 
to mind, not relying on scriptural 
sources 不立文字. The Chan school records 
him as having passed his enlightenment 
down to a succession of disciples, who 
<pb n="156"/>
are called the patriarchs of the Chan 
school.

  The obstruction to bodhi; same as

<xa>菩薩</xa>
  A transliteration of the Sanskrit 
bodhisattva, which means 'enlightening 
being.' (1) Generally speaking, a person
 intent on the attainment of 
enlightenment, who has fully altruistic 
motivations. (2) The bodhisattva is the 
model practitioner in the Maha^ya^na 大乘 
tradition, who dedicates his/her life 
entirely to the salvation of other 
beings. This concept is used in Maha^ya^
na texts to distinguish from the earlier
<pb n="157"/>
 Indian concept of arhat, a being who is
 also enlightened, but who, according to
 Maha^ya^nists, possesses an inferior, 
selfishly-attained enlightenment. In 
this regard, the bodhisattva is said to 
possess two main characteristics which 
distinguish her/him from the arhat 阿羅漢, 
and other inferior religious 
practitioners: a deep sense of 
compassion 慈悲 for the suffering of all 
other beings, and a special type of 
wisdom based on a realization of the 
nature of the emptiness (/su^nyata^ 空) 
of all existences. The bodhisattva 
attains his/her enlightenment by 
arousing the thought of selfless 
enlightenment (bodhicitta) and 
practicing the six perfections (pa^
ramita^ 六度) based on compassion (karuna^
). (3) The term bodhisattva is also 
often applied as an honorific title to 
the great Buddhist teachers of antiquity
, such as Na^ga^rjuna 龍樹 and Asan%ga 無著.

 superb understanding and practice 勝解行住。
 (3) The stage of ultimate bliss 極歡喜住。(4
) The stage of unimpeded action of the 
precepts 增上戒住。 (5) The stage of

stages of unimpeded wisdom 增上慧住: 
unimpeded wisdom concomitant with the 
stems of enlightenment 覺分相應增上慧住, 
unimpeded wisdom concomitant with all 
correct perceptions of reality 諸諦相應增上慧住,
 unimpeded wisdom concomitant with 
dependent origination, sam!sa^ra and the
 stopping of thought 緣起流轉止息相應增上慧住。(9) 
the markless stage that has preparatory 
practices and efficacy 有加行有功用無相住。 (10) 
The markless stage that lack preparatory
 practices and efficacy 無加行無功無相住。 (11) 
the stage of unhindered understanding 無礙
解住。 (12) The stage of ultimate 
consummation of bodhisattvahood 最上成滿菩薩住。
 This is followed by the stage of the 
Tatha^gata 如來住.［瑜伽論T 1579.30.552c25-

In the same way the commonality of dogs,
 cats, etc. is established. This is also

 fact that a human being, in the middle 
of his life, cannot suddenly change into
 a dog or cat, is due to this power.


<pb n="188"/>
<xa>眾徒</xa>

<xa>眾生</xa>
  "Sentient being." (1) All beings. In 
Buddhist scriptures, sentient beings are
 mentioned in contrast to buddhas, as 
those who are still bound in the 
suffering of sam!sa^ra, who are not yet 
enlightened; in this meaning, synonymous
 with 凡夫, which means "regular person," 
or "worldling." On the other hand, it is
 the awareness that is present in 
sentient beings--exactly their "
sentiency" which is the quality of 
buddhahood itself. Therefore there is 
the Maha^ya^na doctrine of "all sentient
 beings are originally buddhas." (2) 
After the time of Xuanzang 玄奘, this term
 was translated into Chinese as youqing 
有情 "having sentiency." In the Nirva^na-
su^tra, it is clearly stated that '
sentient beings' means all things, even 
those things that we would normally 
consider inanimate, such as minerals, 
and that all of these things possess the
 Buddha-nature.


<pb n="189"/>
<xa>眾生執</xa>
  Attachment to sentient being-hood. A 
term used throughout the Prakarana^ryava
^ca-/sa^stra as basically equivalent to

attachment to the notion of self." It is
 used in contradistinction to the term 法
執--attachment to elemental constructs. ［
顯揚論, T 1602.31.559c3-7］


<xa>眾生界</xa>

distinguished from the realm of the

<xa>眾經目錄</xa>
  The "Catalog of Scriptures." A record 
made of the extant Tripitaka in China on
 several occasions during the 
development of the Buddhist tradition in
 China. There are three: (1) That 
compiled in 594 by the team of twenty 
scholars headed by Fajing 法經, also known
 as Fajing's catalogue (法經錄). This was a
 comprehensive catalog of Chinese 
<pb n="190"/>
language sutras which was compiled by 
referring to all the listings of 
scriptures recorded in previous 
catalogues from the Six Dynasties period
. The catalogue's systematic arrangement
 included 2,257 works in 5,310 fascicles
, understood to be the total amount of 
sutras then extant in China. The 
compilers of this catalogue 
distinguished themselves by making clear
 note of the dubious provenance of such 
texts as the Renwang jing (仁王經; Sutra of
 Benevolent Kings) and the Dasheng qixin
 lun. 7 fasc., T 2146.55.115-149. (2) 
The five fascicle version compiled eight
 years later (602) during the Sui by 
Yancong (557-610) and a group of 
Buddhist experts, for the express 
purpose of distinguishing between extant
 and non-extant works, which had not 
been done in the prior catalog. This 
work is distinguished by the fact that 
it allows for the canonical inclusion of
 certain texts such as the Fanwang jing 
(梵網經; Sutra of Brahma's Net), Renwang 
jing and Dasheng qixin lun. (3) The five
 fascicle version by Qingtai 靜泰、 T 2148.

  Tibetan Buddhism. In Japanese, also

 century that a solid Buddhist element 
had developed. Tibet was an isolated 
mountain country and also possessed a 
well-established native tradition in the
 Bon religion. Nonetheless, through the 
eighth and ninth centuries Buddhism grew
 in influence, and sects began to form 
as the Tripitaka was translated into the
 Tibetan language. The eleventh century 
was a period of significant growth for 
<pb n="204"/>
Tibetan Buddhism through the influence 
of three major teachers of the period, 
Atis!a (982-1054), Marpa (1012-1097), 
and Milarepa (1040-1123). The origins of
 Tibetan Buddhism's most well-known sect
, the Gelukpa ("Partisans of Virtue"), 
can be traced back to its influential 
teacher, Tsong-kha-pa (1357-1419). It 
was Tsong-kha-pa and his school who 
implemented the famous geshe training 
system, wherein monks study at a 
Buddhist monastic college until they 
attain the equivalent of a Ph.D. in 
Buddhist philosophy. To this day Gelukpa
 monks are trained in accordance with 
this geshe system, accounting for the 
strong level of scholastic discipline 
for which this sect is famous. Tsong-kha
-pa's line is also associated with the 
development of a custom familiar to many
 modern people--the Dalai Lama system. 
The term lama 喇嘛 means "spiritual guide"
 and is equivalent to the Sanskrit term,
 guru. The Dalai Lama line started in 
the fifteenth century with the third 
successor in Tsong-kha-pa's line, his 
nephew Gendun Truppa, who was believed 
to be an incarnation of the great 
bodhisattva Avalokite/svara. Since the 
time of this first Dalai Lama, the Dalai
<pb n="205"/>
 Lamas have been considered to be the 
ongoing reincarnation of Avalokite/svara
, who is repeatedly found as a baby born
 forty-nine days after the death of the 
prior incarnation. The present Dalai 
Lama is the fourteenth incarnation in 
this line.
          In terms of doctrine and 
practice, Tibetan Buddhism has been 
developed primarily out of three major 
streams that it received from India: Ma^
dhyamika 中觀派, Yoga^ca^ra 瑜伽行派 and 
Vajraya^na 密教. Developments in Tibet of 
the latter school have been especially 
pronounced, as the tendencies of 
indigenous Tibetan shamanic practice 
thought provided much additional impetus
 to the Vajrayana tradition that had 
been developed by the Indians. Thus, 
Tibetan Buddhism is up to the present 
distinguished by its extensive use of 
mantras, ritual, iconography and its 
precise documentation of esoteric 
matters such as the passage of the 
spirit to its next destination after 
death.

  (1) Nakamura defines these as 
conceptual errors, errors in perception

severed in the Path of Seeing. Wonhyo, 
in his Doctrine of the Two Hindrances, 
explains the "seeing afflictions" as 
conceptually arisen afflictions 分別起 --
afflictions that have been produced in 
this lifetime due to misunderstandings 
regarding reality, and which are named 
as they are due to the fact that they 
are removed during the Path of Seeing 見道
--the same in connotation as 見道所斷 listed
 below. These are posited in contrast 
with the more fundamental innate 
afflictions 俱生起 of desire, hatred and 
ignorance, collectively called 修惑 or 思惑 
that are removed in the subsequent Path 
of Cultivation 修道. The 見惑 comprise the

stage at which one enters the level of 
the sagely wisdom without outflow 無漏智. ［
二障義HPC 1.808c12］It is after entry into 
this stage that one is considered in the
 Abhidharmako/sa and in Yoga^ca^ra, to 
be enlightened 聖者. In Abhidharma 
doctrine it is equivalent to the stage 
of stream-winner 預流向 and in Maha^ya^na, 
equivalent to the stage of the first bhu
^mi 初地. In the Abhidharmako/sa-bha^sya 
it is equivalent to the attainment of

equivalent to the stage of proficiency 通
達位. After the consummation of this stage
, one moves on to the Path of 
Cultivation 修道, where the correct views 
attained in the Path of Seeing are 
thoroughly and repeatedly practiced. The
 practices of the Path of Seeing are

<xa>觀世自在</xa>
  Avalokite/svara Bodhisattva. <_-xa>觀世音</_-xa>


<xa>觀世音</xa>
  The bodhisattva Avalokite/svara, whose
 name is interpreted as "The One who 
Observes the Sounds of the World." This 
particular Chinese rendering is that 
done by Kuma^raji^va, most importantly 
in his translation of the Lotus Sutra ［法
華經 T 262.9.2a8］. Dharmapa^la translated 
the name as guangshiyin 光世音 and Xuanzang
 translated as guanzizai 觀自在. Also 
commonly written as 觀音 and 觀世自在. 
Avalokite/svara is one of the most 
important Bodhisattvas in the Maha^ya^na
 tradition, considered the embodiment of
 the Buddhist virtue of compassion. He/
she is interpreted to be the power of 
the buddha Amita^bha manifested as a 
bodhisattva, and is therefore often 
depicted as the helper of the buddha of 
the Pure Land 淨土. Since Avalokite/svara 
is capable of manifesting 33 forms of 
incarnation to save people according to 
their capacities, he/she is depicted 
iconographically in 33 different ways, 
which are distinguished by the number of
 heads and arms as well as by the 
<pb n="223"/>
attributes held in the hands. One of the
 most important loci classicus for the 
description of Avalokite/svara is the 
chapter on the Universal Gate of 
Avalokite/svara Bodhisattva 觀世音菩薩普門品 in 
the Lotus Sutra 法華經, where the rationale
 for his/her naming is given.［法華經、T 262.
9.56a］
Regarding the difference in the Chinese 
renderings: When Xuanzang rendered the 
name as 觀自在, he was reading the original
 Sanksrit as avalokita ("observe") + i/
svara ("unimpeded"), which accords with 
the Tibetan rendering of spyan ras gzigs
 dban% phyug. Kuma^raji^va's rendering 
interprets the original name to be 
Avalokitasvara, meaning a compassionate 
buddha or bodhisattva who is sensitive 
to, and responds to the suffering of 
sentient beings.

while her husband was imprisoned. This 
scripture teaches sixteen kinds of 
meditation 十六觀 as a means for attaining 
rebirth in the Pure Land. It concludes 
by saying that even the most sinful of 
people can attain this kind of rebirth 
by chanting the name of Amita^bha Buddha

symbolizing wisdom, may burn the 
afflictions as well as demonic curses. 
To perform this, the trinity of subject 
(the Buddha), fireplace, and worshipper 
is necessary. If the worshipper's 
actions of body, mouth, and mind are 
completely pure, the corresponding 
actions in the world will be pure and 
every affliction and curse will be 
eliminated.

<xa>護法</xa>
  Dharmapa^la. One of the ten great 
exponents of Yoga^ca^ra 瑜伽行派 in India, 
supposed to have been born in the middle
 of the sixth century, C.E. He wrote a 
commentary on the Thirty Verses on 
Consciousness-only 唯識三十論 by Vasubandhu, 
which was later translated into Chinese 
by Xuanzang 玄奘. Born as the son of a 
high government minister. At about the 
age of twenty, on the evening that he 
was supposed to marry a princess, he ran
 away to a mountain temple. Subsequently
 he studied and mastered the teachings 
of the Lesser Vehicle 小乘 and Maha^ya^na 
大乘, later traveling extensively, and 
becoming famous for his debates with non
-Buddhists. Later he received 
instruction in the dharma from Digna^ga 
陣那 while staying at Na^landa^ temple. He
 taught Yoga^ca^ra doctrine extensively 
and had many disciples. He is especially
 well-known for his understanding that 
consciousness is always manifested in 
both its subjective and objective 
aspects, as distinguished from 
Sthiramati 安慧, who understood the 
bifurcation of consciousness into 
<pb n="272"/>
subject and object to be wholly 
imaginary. At the age of twenty-nine he 
retired into Asam!bodhi temple and 
passed away at the age of 32. His 
interpretations regarding the nature of 
consciousness became predominant in the 
Faxiang 法相 stream of Xuanzang and Kuiji 
窺基.

<xa>輪回</xa>
  (sam!sa^ra); 'transmigration.' (1) The
 original meaning of sam!sa^ra is "flow 
together." This is the expression of the
 ancient Indian idea that all living 
things repeatedly pass through life and 
death. Like a continually spinning wheel
<pb n="302"/>
, sentient beings are reincarnated and 
die without end. In Buddhism, one is 
said to transmigrate through the triple 
realm (desire, form and formless realms)
 and the six destinies (god, demigod, 
human, animal, hungry ghost, hell-being)
. However, this original word sam!sa^ra 
in modern Sanskrit and Hindi usage means
 "world" or "within the world." This 
usage can be traced back to a fairly 
early period. Accordingly, when the term
 lunhui is found in Chinese Buddhist 
texts, it should not be simply 
understood as 'reincarnation.'


<xa>輪轉</xa>

aimlessly, to repeatedly pass through

Buddhist Indian tradition, this refers 
to a sagely, benevolent and capable 
ruler, who eminently handles the domain;
 somewhat of an ideal, mythical vision 
of the perfect king, who is able to rule
 by righteousness rather than by force. 
In Buddhism, a special meaning is 
implied, with this ruler possessing a 
buddha's enlightenment and abilities. In
 particular, there are four kings, who 
possess gold, silver, bronze and iron 
wheels respectively (cakravarti-ra^ja).

the Maha^ya^na scriptures, is aimed 
toward the "lesser" goal of arhatship 阿羅
漢, rather than toward complete 
buddhahood. (1) The first Chinese 
rendering of the term, yuanjue 緣覺, 
emphasizes the method by which the 
practitioner attains the goal, that is 
by analyzing the principle of the twelve
-part conditioned origination 十二因緣.［寶性論T
 1611.31.821a］ (2) The second rendering,
 dujue 獨覺, refers to the fact that this 
practitioner attains liberation through 
his or her own study and effort, not 
relying on the sermons of a teacher, and
 staying alone, absorbed in 
contemplation. This term was originally 
borrowed from the non-Buddhist Jain sect
. ［俱舍論、 T 1558.29.64a］ (3) Related to 
definition #2, a person who attains 
liberation but who does not come to the

  Ben kenmitsu nikyo^ron; T 2427.77374-
381; Comparing Exoteric and Esoteric 
Discourse, 2 fasc. Ku^kai's 空海 classic 
work on esoteric thought, composed in 
814 CE. Justifying his presentation on 
the grounds that esotericism remains 
poorly understood 人末多解 while exotericism
 has been expounded at length, Ku^kai 
outlines several differences in the two 
modes of discourse which may be 
summarised as follows: 1) the exoteric 
is characterised by literalism 顯 and 
omission 略逗機, while the esoteric is 
<pb n="312"/>
hidden 密 and final 全. 2) exoteric 
discourse originates in ostensibly real 
or historical figures 應身, while esoteric
 discourse is revealed by universal 
entities for their own pleasure 自受法樂. 3)
 "esoteric" refers to the concealed 
original nature of sentient beings and 
the inner realization 內證 of the Tatha^
gata; "exoteric" refers to the 
concealment of inner realization in 
expedient teachings. Ku^kai acknowledges
 that "esoteric" is a somewhat relative 
term, so that the Maha^ya^na may be 
considered esoteric from the standpoint 
of the Hinaya^na. Furthermore, esoteric 
notions may be found in earlier texts 
such as the Da/sabhu^mika 十地經 and in non
-Buddhist treatises as well. On the 
question of whether dhara^n!i^s 陀羅尼 
ought to be considered esoteric, since 
they are often based on exoteric texts, 
Ku^kai says that they are of esoteric 
character but are not final like the 
teaching of the Dharma Embodied 法身. Much
 of the text is occupied by quotations 
from a number of sources (T 261, T 360, 
T 671, T 848, T 861, T 865, T 866, T 867

sect of Japanese Buddhism. Born into a

parents at an early age. He entered Mt. 
Hiei 比睿山 as a novice at the age of 
thirteen, staying for about two years. 
After learning with Ko^in 公胤 of Miidera 
三井寺 for a period of time, he next moved 
on to Kenninji 建仁寺 where he had a chance
 to study with Esai 榮西, the founder of 
the Japanese Rinzai school. Following 
<pb n="338"/>
Esai's death, he traveled to Song China 
together with Esai's successor Myo^zen 明
全. Here he was exposed to a number of 
the influential streams of Ch'an, 
including that of Dahui 大慧, but his 
major awakening came as a result of his 
encounter with the Caotong 曹洞 master 
Rujing 如淨 at Tiantong shan 天童山. In 1227 
Do^gen returned to Japan where he began 
to institute the Caotong (So^to^) 
teaching at Kenninji and then moving to 
Fukakusa where he opened up Ko^sho^ji 興聖
寺. Here he spent about ten productive 
years during which he composed his most 
important work, the Sho^bo^genzo^ 正法眼藏. 
His final important period followed this
, when he moved into the mountains of 
Echizen prefecture to establish a center
 for pure meditational practice away 
from the secular influences of the 
capital. This new monastery was 
originally named Daibutsuji 大佛寺 and was 
later named Eiheiji 永平寺, which survives 
to the present as an active monastery 
for the practice of Zen. In addition to 
the Sho^bo^genzo^ (95 fasc.) he composed
 numerous influential works, including 
the Fukanzazengi 普勸坐禪(1 fasc.), the 
Eiheishingi 永平清規 (2 fasc.), and Gakudo^

greatly responsible for the spread of 
Buddhism during his era, said to have 
more than five hundred disciples. He was
 an early developer of precepts in East 
Asia, and a prolific author/commentator.
 A sort of chi^d prodigy in terms of 
Buddhist studies, he began at an early 
age to write commentaries on the dhya^na
 sutras that had been translated by An 
Shigao 安世高, a work which brought him 
early admiration and numerous disciples.
 In his commentarial work, Daoan was one
 of the first to acknowledge the need to
 break dependence on the translation 
method of matching the meanings 格義 of 
Buddhist philosophical concepts with pre
-existent Daoist terms, desiring instead
 the establishment of an independent 
Buddhist system of terminology. He was 
deeply concerned about establishing 
standards of quality for Chinese 
translations of Indian works, and in 
line with this aim, created one of the 
earliest catalogues of Chinese Buddhist 
scriptures, called the Zongli zhongjing 
mulu 綜理眾經目錄, popularly known as the Anlu
 安錄 (An's Catalogue). Daoan is also 
credited as being a founder of the

<pb n="372"/>
of instruction on Buddhist practices 
such as expression of faith and 
repentance, as well as basic doctrine, 
such as the five skandhas, dependent 
origination, emptiness and so forth. 
There are five Chinese translations, as 
well as various commentarial works 
available. The three primary 
translations are (1) by Dharmaks!ema 曇無讖
 of the Northern Liang (金光明經; T 663.16.
335-357, 4 fascicles in eight chapters);
 (2) By Baogui 寶貴 et. al. of the Sui 
dynasty (合部金光明經; T 664.16.359-402; 8 
fasc.); (3) by Yijing 義淨 of the Tang 
dynasty (金光明最勝王經; T 665.16.403-457, 10 
fascicles in 31 chapters). Though the 
first translation is incomplete, it has 
famous commentaries attached. The merit 
of this sutra is that wherever it is 
worshipped, the four Guardian Gods (護四王)
 protect the state and benefit the 
people. One of the three 'state 
protecting sutras' in Japan, along with 
the Lotus Sutra 法華經 and Sutra of the 
Benevolent King 仁王經. See T 1783-1787.

trance where all of the most subtle 
defilements are destroyed, which is the 
final stage of bodhisattva practice. 
Also called "vajra-sama^dhi 金剛三昧." Maha^

(2) Vajrabodhi (671-741). Indian monk, 
translator and ritual master 
acknowledged as one of the eight 
patriarchs of the doctrine 傅授八祖 in 
Shingon lineages. Born into the Bra^hman
!a caste, he joined Na^landa monastery 那
爛陀寺 at age 10. There, he is said to have
 studied Yoga^cara and mainstream texts 
such as the Madhya^ntavibha^gat!i^ka 辯分邊
論, later becoming preceptor to the 
Pallava king Narasim!havarma Ra^jasim!ha
 II. His esoteric studies began in 702 
after meeting Nagabodhi 龍智, an expert in
 the vajrayoga of the Tattvasam!graha 金剛
頂. Vajrabodhi received initiation and 
continued to be his disciple for the 
next seven years. while on a pilgrimage 
to Lan%ka 楞伽山, a mysterious vision 
inspired him to propagate the doctrine 
in China. Taking the sea route, he 
briefly sojourned in S/rivijaya; on the 
last leg of the trip, he lost the 
massive Sanskrit text of the Tattvasam!

 He arrived in Canton in 720 and 
proceeded to Loyang 洛陽. There he began 
performing rituals, initiating disciples
 and translating esoteric texts. In 723,
 he wrote down the first chapter of the 
Tattvasam!graha from memory, the '
Abridged, Recitable Vajra Summit Yoga' 金
剛頂瑜伽中 略出念誦經 (T 766). The emperor 
Xuanzong 玄宗 lent his support to this 
proselytising and was later initiated 
into the esoteric doctrine by Vajrabodhi
. From 723 onwards Vajrabodhi resided at
 the Zisheng temple 資聖寺, translating and
 composing a substantial number of 
esoteric texts, most of which were 
completed between 731 and 736. He passed
 away shortly before a planned return to
 India in 741. His most prominent 
disciple was Amoghavajra 不空金剛, who 
continued his work as author, imperial 
patron and propagator of the esoteric 
doctrine.

nengduan panruo boluomi jing 金剛能斷般若波羅蜜經 
and Foshuo nengduan jingang panruo 
boluomi jing 佛說能斷金剛般若波羅密經, which are 
more faithful to the original title in 
Sanskrit. Six Chinese translations 
survive of this popular short Prajn~a^pa
^ramita^ sutra, listed here by 
translator (Taisho^ reference) and date:
 (1) Kuma^raji^va 鳩摩羅什 (T235.8.748c-752c
), 403 CE; Bodhiruci (T 236.8.752c-761c)
, 509 CE; Parama^rtha (T 237.8.762a-766c
), 562CE; Dharmagupta (T 238.8.766c-771c
), 605 CE; Xuanzang (T 220(9)), 648 CE; 
and Yijing (T 239.8.771c-775b), 703 CE. 
The Bodhiruci translation actually 
consists of two separate versions of the
 sutra, presumably either of differing 
Sanskrit manuscripts, or translated at 
different times in his career. The Kuma^
raji^va version was the first and most 
popular of the translations, as 
evidenced by the fact that it is his 
text that is used by later commentators.
 However, as is typical of Kuma^raji^va'
s translations, it is somewhat freer in 
style compared with other Chinese 
renditions of the Sanskrit. Later 
translations, by contrast, were much 
more literal. Most notable is 
Dharmagupta's, which breaks with Kuma^
<pb n="386"/>
raji^va's text entirely and translates 
very literally. The exegetical tradition
 regarding this sutra is extensive in 
the Chinese Canon, including both native
 treatises and treatises of Indian 
origin translated into Chinese. In the 
Taisho^ gempan Daizo^kyo^, texts 
directly related to the Vajracchedika 
Prajn~a^pa^ramita^-su^tra include T 1510
-15, T 1698-1704. Due to the 
combinationn of its brevity and 
popularity, the Diamond Sutra has been 
translated into English many times, from
 both Chinese and Sanskrit.

  The Jingangdingjing yujia shiba hui 
zhigui (Synopsis of the Eighteen 
Assemblies in the Vajra/sekhara Yoga). 1
 fasc. (T 869.18.284-287), abbr. 
Synopsis of the Eighteen Assemblies 十八會指
歸, composed by Amoghavajra 不空 shortly 
after his voyage to India in the mid-8th
 century CE. A short account of a 
massive corpus of esoteric literature, 
known in its entirety as the Vajra/
sekhara 金剛頂經. This corpus is said to 
consist of 18 texts or "assemblies" 會 
totaling 100,000 /slokas, and is headed 
by a fundamental work called the 
Tattvasam!graha 真實攝經, here said to 
consist of the fundamental work, whose 
contents are described in some detail. 
The remainder of the account is occupied
 by much shorter summaries of the 
remaining 17 assemblies. Several of the 
assemblies have since been identified 
with independently circulated texts, 
although these texts are generally 
larger and more evolved than indicated 
<pb n="393"/>
by Amoghavajra. Eastman (1981) has 
tentatively established the identity of 
the Vajra/sekhara and eighteen maha^yoga
 texts found in an edition of the rNying
 ma rgyud 'bum, a large collection of 
esoteric works associated with the 
rNying ma pa 寧瑪流. It has also been shown
 by Tanaka-Ki (1984) that the ninth text
, the Sama^yoga, combines the practices 
and six families (Vajrasattva-kula, 
Vairocana-kula, Heruka-kula, Vajrasu^rya
-kula, Padmanarte/svara-kula, Parama^/
sva-kula) of preceding assemblies. 
According to Tanaka-Ki (1987) and de 
Jong (1980), the assemblies so far 
identified (partially or otherwise) with
 known texts are as follows:
1. Sarvatatha^gatatattvasam!graha 一切如來真實
攝教王 (T 865, 882);
4. Trailokyavijaya-maha^kalpara^ja 降三世金剛
瑜伽 (part P.115, T.1040);

9. Sarvabuddhasama^yogad!a^kini^ja^lasam

15. Guhyasama^ja-tantra 秘密集會瑜伽 (T 885);
16. Advayasamata^-kalpara^ja^ 無二平等瑜伽 (T

<xa>金輪</xa>
  "Metal wheel" "gold wheel." (1) From 
Buddho-Indian mytho-cosmology. Above the
 primordial void are three layered

kings (轉輪聖王). In this case there are 
four wheels (cakra, or rings, which are 
made of gold, silver, copper and iron. 
The "wheel turning King" takes his name 
from the fact that he takes the 
uppermost wheel and on it distributes 
the four great continents and their 
respective contents. This thousand-
spoked golden wheel treasure, originally
 a symbol of the ruling authority of the
 Wheel Turning King is borrowed into 
Buddhism, where it is used to symbolize 
the authority of the King of the Dharma 
(the Buddha), and his exposition of true
 reality comes to be referred to as "
turning the wheel of the dharma." 
Because of this, in Buddhist iconography
 and art, the Buddha is depicted as 
having the physical marks of thousand 
spoke wheels on the palms of his hands 
and the undersides of his feet. (3) The 
Golden Wheel Sage King.

by Sho^cho^ 承澄 (1205-1281) in Fuminaga 文
永. The three syllables of the title 
refer to the three families 三部 of the 
East Asian esoteric pantheon: the buddha
 family is 'a' 阿 (anutpa^da), the dharma
-body of originally uncreated dharmas; 
the lotus family is 'sa' 娑 (sata), the 
lotus of attachment to untainted dharmas
; and the vajra family is 'va' 縛 (
varjana), the vajra of preaching dharmas
 which transcend words. Historical 
anecdotes and quotes from relevant texts
 accompany the presentations of 
iconography and ritual. This compendium 
is authoritative for Japanese Tendai 台密.

<xa>阿彌陀</xa>
  A transliteration of the Sanskrit 
Amita^bha (the Buddha of Limitless Light
 無量光佛) or Amita^yus (the Buddha of 
Limitless Life 無量壽佛). A Buddha who 
possesses infinite meritorious qualities
; who expounds the dharma in his pure 
paradise (Sukha^vati^) in the West. 
According to tradition Amita^bha was in 
ancient times a king who, having come in
 contact with the Buddhist teaching, 
renounced his throne and became a monk 
with the name of Dharmaka^ra. He 
resolved to become a Buddha and in this 
way to come into possession of a 
paradise in which all who call his name 
might be born into a life of unbounded 
joy. This is the result of his forty-
eight vows 四十八願, the most important of 
<pb n="420"/>
which are the eighteenth 十八願 and 
nineteenth 十九願, in which he promises not
 to achieve supreme perfect 
enlightenment until he have saved all 
sentient beings in his paradise. Amita^
bha is thus the primary deity of the 
Pure Land school 淨土宗 of Buddhism which 
developed and spread in China, Vietnam, 
Korean and Japan. In iconographic art, 
Amita^bha is usually portrayed as having
 two assistants: Avalokite/svara 觀音 (
also considered as his incarnation) who 
appears on his left and Maha^stha^mapra^
pta 勢至 who appears on his right. He is 
also one of the five buddhas 五佛 of the 
vajradha^tu. The basic doctrine 
concerning Amita^bha and his vows can be
 found in the Amita^bha-su^tra 阿彌陀經 and 
the Sutra of Infinite Life 無量壽經.

 Kuma^raji^va 鳩摩羅什; with the full name 
of 佛說阿彌陀經 (T 366.12.346b-348b). One of 
the three basic scriptures of the East 
Asian Pure Land school 淨土宗, which gives 
an exact account of the Pure Land. It 
was commented on by a wide number of 
scholars after the Kuma^raji^va 
translation appeared. Before the Sui and
 Tang periods the Greater Sukha^vati^ 
Sutra and the Sutra on the Meditation on
 Infinite Life 觀無量壽經 were predominant in
 Pure Land Teaching, but after Shandao's
 善導 influence, this sutra came to be 
held in equal regard to the prior two. 
This was primarily a result of Shandao's
 Fashizan 法事贊, in which he explained the
 rituals associated with the reading of 
the text. It was also commented on by 
Sengzhao 僧肇 and Zhiyi 智顗.

161-310) and between 651 and 654 by 
Xuanzang 玄奘 (30 fasc., T 1558.29.1-160).
 Vasubandhu's most important pre-Yoga^ca
^ra work. Consisting of verses (also 
translated separately as T 1560) with 
exposition, the Ko/sa organizes and 
condenses primarily Sarva^stiva^da 
Abhidharma teachings, but not without 
being critical, and hence adopting 
positions associated with other Buddhist
 schools, such as the Sautra^ntikas 經量部.
 It was this intellectual restlessness 
that eventually led Vasubandhu to become
 a Yoga^ca^rin. This text includes 
detailed analysis of the action of human
 consciousness in its relationship to 
the environment, as well as the 
transformations that occur in the 
process of meditation practice, 
containing treatment of most of the 
philosophical topics contained in the 
<pb n="427"/>
Abhidharma treatises, as well as a 
refutation of the theories of the Vaibha
^s!ikas. Both Chinese versions consist 
of nine chapters, including discussions 
on dha^tu 界, indriya 根, loka, karman 業, 
anu/saya 隨眠, a^ryapudgala, jn~a^na 知, 
sama^dhi 定, and refutation of the 
concept atman 我. Its doctrines would 
contribute to the development of the 
theories of the school of Yoga^ca^ra 瑜伽行
派. The title is commonly abbreviated as 
Jushe lun 俱舍論.
         Vallée Poussin (1931) 
translated Xuanzang's version into 
French (6 vols.) before a Sanskrit 
version was rediscovered in this century
. Leo Pruden (1988) translated the 
French version into English, though some
 errors were introduced. Jha (1983) 
offers separate English translations of 
the Sanskrit version (as edited by 
Prahlad Pradhan) and Vallée Poussin's 
rendition of Xuanzang, but he stops with
 Chapter Two (the Ko/sa has nine 
chapters). Further volumes of Jha's work
 have not been announced.

Nirvana Sutra 涅槃經, and venerated 
especially by Zen sects, were believed 
to have compiled the Maha^vibha^s!a four

the end of rebirth into the world of 
suffering. The highest rank of 
attainment in early Indian Buddhism; one

<xa>阿陀那識</xa>
  The a^da^na-vijn~a^na which is, in 
East Asian dharma-characteristic schools
, equivalent in meaning to a^laya-vijn~a
^na 阿賴耶識. The special connotations 
implied by a^da^na is that of 執持--
holding, or maintaining, as is the base 
consciousness which holds and maintains 
the sense consciousnesses, seeds, and 
the appearance of individuality. Also 
translated into Chinese as 執持識--the "
maintaining consciousness."［顯揚論, T 1602.
31.480c］ (2) Also used as a term for the
 seventh consciousness, or the 
obstructed neutral aspect of the eighth 
consciousness. In schools such as Dilun 
and Shenglun, this had to be interpreted
 as the seventh consciousness, as they 
understood the eighth consciousness to 
be completely undefiled.

time of Buddha's death he had not yet 
attained enlightenment, and only 
achieved this following the exhortations
 of Ka^/syapa 迦葉, S/a^kyamuni's 
successor. After his enlightenment, the 
rest of the sam!gha allowed his

begins each recitation with "Thus I have
 heard...(如是我聞)"

<xa>阿賴耶</xa>
  The transliteration of the Sanskrit a^

<pb n="448"/>
consciousness. <_-xa>阿賴耶識</_-xa>


<xa>阿賴耶識</xa>
'Store consciousness (a^layavijn~a^na). 
,' 'container consciousness;' translated
 into Chinese as 藏識. Also known as the 
eighth consciousness 第八識. The eighth and
 the most fundamental of the eight 
consciousnesses established in the 
doctrine of the Yoga^ca^ra 瑜伽行派 school. 
The a^laya consciousness accumulates all
 potential energy for the mental and 
physical manifestation of one's 
existence, and supplies the substance to
 all existences. It also receives 
impressions from all functions of the 
other consciousnesses and retains them 
as potential energy for their further 
manifestations and activities. Since it 
serves as the basis for the production 
of the other seven consciousness (called
 the "transformed consciousnesses" 轉識), 
it is also known as the "base 
consciousness" (mu^la-vijn~a^na) 本識, and
 "causal consciouness" 緣識. Since it 
serves as the container for all 
experiential impressions (termed 
metaphorically as "seeds" it is also 
called the "seed consciousness" 種子識.
<pb n="449"/>
There are three meanings of the term '
storehouse:' (1) Subject store. The a^
laya-vijn~a^na stores and keeps all the 
seeds of the mind within one's 
consciousness. (2) Object-store. The 
eighth consciousness store and 
perfumates the seeds for the prior seven
 consciousnesses. (3) Attachment-store. 
The eighth consciousness provides a 
sense of eternality, unity, subjectivity
 and mastery, resembling an eternal a^
tman, thus causing the seventh 
consciousness to mistakenly perceive and
 attach to a self.

Vasubandhu. He wrote the Nya^yadvarataka
-/sa^stra (因明正理門論: "Treatise on Entering
 the True Principle of Causal Logic"), 
establishing the New School of Hetu-
vidya^. By establishing the three 
characteristics of cause on the nine 
possible combinations of like and unlike
, by converting the old five-part 
syllogism into a three-part syllogism, 
he changed Buddhist logic from the 
analogical method to the deductive 
method, giving it a completely different
 logical basis. Also, in the field of 
Consciousness-only theory, he developed 
the theory of the three aspects 三分 of 
consciousness: subjective, objective and
 self-witnessing. Among his works are 
the one fascicle Guan suoyuan lun 觀所緣論, 
the Zhangzhong lun 掌中論, the Wuxiangsi

Also called suihuo 隨惑. In the 
Abhidharmako/sa-bha^sya 俱舍論, there are 
two meanings to this term, the first 
being the meaning of all afflictions. 
This entails regarding all afflictions 
as arising afterwards in relation to the
 mind. The second is the meaning of 
these defilements as "outside" the six 
primary afflictions 六煩惱, that is, as "
branch" afflictions. In the Abhidharmako
/sa these are indolence 放逸, laziness 懈怠,
 no-faith 不信, depression 沈, flightiness

, enmity 恨, flattery 諂, deception 誑, 
haughtiness 憍, torpor 睡眠, and remorse 悔,
 totaling nineteen.
In the doctrine of the Yoga^ca^ra school
 瑜伽行派, this term refers to the twenty 
secondary afflictions that are derived 
from the six fundamental afflictions i.e
., the six primary defilements 六煩惱. In 
Yoga^ca^ra theory, these twenty are 
divided into three groups. The first 
group, containing the ten lesser 
afflictions includes anger 忿, enmity 恨, 
vexation 惱, concealing 覆, deceit 誑, 
flattery (or trickery) 諂, haughtiness 憍,
 harming 害, jealousy 嫉, and stinginess 慳
. The group of middling secondary 
defilements includes no conscience 無慚, 
and no-shame 無愧, and the greater 
secondary afflictions include no-faith 不

capacity of afflictions (煩悩). The latent
 or dormant condition of defilements, 
esp. as contrasted with their active, or
 manifest condition: 現行, 纏. (4) A 
synonym for defilement or affliction. (5
) In the later writings of the Sarva^
stiva^da school 說一切有部, the term was 
defined with the three meanings of 隨增 (
increasing in strength), 隨逐 (concomitant
 with marks) and 隨縛 (binding). They 
furthermore gave a number of lists of 
defilements, such as "six defilements," 
"seven defilements," etc. (anu/saya) (6)
 In Yoga^ca^ra theory the term refers to
 the afflictions that lie dormant in the
 a^laya-vijn~a^na 阿賴耶識 in the form of 
seeds 種子 or debilitating afflictions 粗重.
 The defilements in their state of 
dormancy, as opposed to when they are in
<pb n="464"/>
 the state of manifest activity → 現行. 
Practitioners who experience a feeling 
of purity and enhanced awareness are 
often self-deceived into thinking they 
have eliminated their bad habits, and 
are unaware that many still lie hidden 
in the a^laya consciousness.［二障義、 HPC 1.

<xa>隱劣顯勝識</xa>
  The 'consciousness of covering the 
inferior (mental functions) and 
manifesting the superior.' The fourth of
 the five levels of apprehension of the 
principle of consciousness-only. In this
 level there is a covering of those of 
the distinctive mental faculty elements 
心所 which are considered inferior, and a 
manifestation of the mind's basic 
functioning 心王. The four aspects 四分 of 
mental function are not only present in 
the overall cognitive function, but are 
also present in the distinctive mental 
faculties. Thus, the apprehension of 
consciousness-only in the prior (third) 
level is applied to the two above-
mentioned functions. Accordingly, as far
 as the essence of the mind and mental 
<pb n="468"/>
functions are concerned, the overall 
cognitive function which acts as 
governor is developed, and the 
distinctive mental faculties which act 
subordinately are concealed. This is

<xa>首楞嚴三昧經</xa>
  Shoulengyan sanmei jing The S/u^ram!
gama-sama^dhi-su^tra. 　'Sutra of the 
Concentration of Heroic Progress.'　An 
early Maha^ya^na sutra, closely related 
in content to the Vimalaki^rti-nirde/sa-
su^tra 維摩經. Sama^dhi 三昧means 
concentration, a state of mind fixed on 
one point (cittaika^grata^). The 
concentration explained here is the /su^
ra^mgama, or Heroic Progress. It is 
called Heroic Progress because whoever 
possesses it goes everywhere in the 
manner of a hero (/su^ra) without 
meeting any resistance, or because it is
 frequented (gata) by those heroes the 
Buddhas and bodhisattvas. The work is 
undoubtedly of Indian origin, but we 
possess only a few fragments of the 
Sanskrit original: two quotations in S/a
^ntideva's S/iks!a^samuccaya and one 
folio of a manuscript discovered in 
Eastern Turkestan. The complete work is 
known at present through two 
translations: a Chinese translation made
 by Kuma^raji^va 鳩摩羅什, probably between 
402 and 409 C.E.3 and a Tibetan 
translation dating from the beginning of
 the ninth century C.E. ascribed to the 
<pb n="514"/>
collaboration of the Indian pandit S/a^
kyaprabha and the Tibetan exegete 
Dharmaraks!a (in 291), Zhu Shulan (in 
291), Zhang Tianxi, Zhi Shilun and Bo 
Yan (in 373). These translations were 
already lost by the sixth century and we
 only know of them through their titles.
 The full title of the sutra was S/u^ram
!gama-sama^dhi, transliterated in 
Chinese with shoulengyan sanmei 首楞嚴三昧, 
translated into Chinese as yongfuding 勇伏
定 'Concentration of Heroic Victory.' 
Translated into French by Lamotte in 
1965, and this version has been 
translated into English by Boin-Webb in 
Lamotte 1998 (the contents of this entry

<xa>體用</xa>
  Substance-function, essence-function. 
A way of talking about the internal/
external, hidden/manifest, fundamental/
superficial aspects of any person, thing
, or situation, referring most commonly 
<pb n="521"/>
to the most fundamental nature of the 
human mind and its manifest activity/
appearances. One of the most important 
and pervasive metaphysical categories in
 East Asian philosophical thought. (1) 
Usually considered to be first 
articulated as such by Wangbi 王弼, but 
can be seen as a thematic governing 
principle in the earliest of texts such 
as the Yijing易經 and Liji禮記, where the 
same concept is worked out in the form 
of "roots and branches 本末." (2) The 
essence-function construction becomes a 
seminal tool in the sinification of 
Buddhism, as it is applied to reconcile 
the dualism present in such Buddhist 
categories as nirvana/sam!sa^ra, Buddha 
and sentient being, innate enlightenment
/initial enlightenment (本覺?始覺), the two 
truths 二諦 theory and so forth. The 
essence-function concept was first 
pervasively applied in the Awakening of 
Faith 大乘起信論 (along with the intermediate
 concept of attributes 相), to explain 
the meaning of the One mind 一心 and its 
myriad attributes and functions, as well
 as to explain the problem of innate vs.
 initial enlightenment. Subsequent to 
this, the structure was implemented in 
the composition of Chinese scriptural 
<pb n="522"/>
works such as the Platform Sutra of the 
Sixth Patriarch 六祖壇經, and the Sutra of 
Perfect Enlightenment 圓覺經. The essence-
function construction also formed the 
backbone for the Huayan 華嚴metaphysics of
 li/shi 理事 and the four realms of 
reality 四法界. Later East Asian Maha^ya^na
 philosophers, such as Wonhyo 元曉, Zongmi
 宗密, and Chinul 知訥, as well as the 
famous Chan masters of the Five Houses 五
家, utilized essence-function logic 
extensively in their work.

luoshi 羅什. He was from a noble family of

studied the "Hi^naya^na" 小乘 teachings 
and later became a Maha^ya^na 大乘 
adherent, and a specialist in the Ma^
dhyamika 中觀派 doctrine of Na^ga^rjuna. He
 came to Changan in 402, and with the 
aid of numerous collaborators and 
assistants, became one of the most 
prolific translators of Buddhist texts 
in history, rendering some 72 texts into
 Chinese. Among the most important of 
these are the Diamond Sutra 金剛經, Amita^
bha-su^tra, Lotus Sutra 法華經, Vimalaki^
rti-nirde/sa-su^tra 維摩經, Madhyamaka-ka^
rika^ and the Maha^-prajn~a^pa^ramita^-/
sa^stra. His translation was distinctive
, possessing a flowing smoothness that 
reflects his prioritization on the 
conveyance of the meaning as opposed to 
precise literal rendering. Because of 
this, his renderings of seminal Maha^ya^
na texts have often remained more 
popular than later, more exact 
translations.

  From the dàzhua^ngyánlùnji^ng 大莊嚴論經,

" A Buddhist teaching story about a monk
 in ancient India who was exemplary in 
his practice of the precepts. A 
traveling monk comes to an inn where a 
royal jeweler is also staying. The 
jeweler happens to leave a gem on a 
table which is eaten by a goose. Upon 
becoming aware of the missing gem, the 
jeweler blames the monk, who is aware 
that it was actually the goose who stole
 the gem. Fearful that exposure of the 
truth will result in the slaughter of 
the goose, the monk keeps silent, and is
 therefore bound and beaten severely. 
The goose, who returns to drink the 
blood of the bleeding monk, is killed by
 the jeweler, who cuts it open and finds
 the jewel inside.

justification by faith not by works').



<xa>arahant</xa>
One who has attained enlightenment.



<xa>asava</xa>
a 'taint' that obstructs progress toward
 enlightenment. The Abhidhamma lists 
four asavas (perhaps for convenient 
identification with the four 
supramundane paths?): sensual desire, 
desire for eternal existence, 
speculative opinions and ignorance. The 
Suttas usually list only three asavas, 
omitting explicit mention of the taint 
<pb n="223"/>
of speculative opinions (but it is 
referred to implicitly, e.g. at MN 2).



<xa>Avalokiteshvara</xa>
Mahayana Bodhisattva of Compassion



<xa>avijja</xa>
ignorance



<xa>bhavanga</xa>
Sometimes rendered 'life-stream'. In 
Theravada Buddhism, this is the 
underlying stratum of existence that is 
used to explain memory and other '
temporal' phenomena such as moral 
accountability. It is described by 
Buddhaghosa and others as the natural 
condition of mind, bright and shining 
and free from impurity. Note that it is 
regarded as a conditioned phenomenon, 
not as a 'soul' in the sense of Western 
religion. (The Sarvastivadin/Mahayana 
treatment of bhavanga is different.) See
 also alaya-vijnana.

<xa>Heart</xa>
The Prajnaparamita Hridaya Sutra, one of

 paradoxical in its language ("there is 
no suffering, cause, cessation or path")
. Central to most Mahayana schools.



<xa>hermeneutics</xa>
The science of interpretation or 
exegesis of Scripture.



<xa>Hinayana</xa>
Lesser Vehicle. According to Walshe, 
this term was originally coined by 
Mahayana polemicists to distinguish 
their path (seen as a 'greater vehicle' 
with room for all) from the path of the 
<pb n="229"/>
Sarvastivadins (seen as a 'lesser 
vehicle' with room for only one at a 
time). Over time, it came to be applied 
to the only surviving member of the 
original 'eighteen schools' of Southern 
Buddhism, Theravada (q.v.). Many 
Buddhists prefer the term Theravada, 
because 'Hinayana' is perceived to have 
negative connotations.

overcome through training, viz. greed, 
hate, delusion, conceit, speculative 
views, skeptical doubt, mental torpor, 
restlessness, lack of shame, and lack of
 moral dread. (A related term, 
upakkilesa, is also sometimes translated
 as 'defilement' but 'impurities' may be
 preferable in that case. Nyanatiloka's

 Mahayana scriptures. Lotus Sutra 
Buddhists sometimes practice recitation 
of the title of the sutra. See daimoku.



<xa>mappo</xa>

<xa>Mahayana</xa>
Greater Vehicle. The northern branch of 
Buddhism. More doctrinally liberal than 
Theravada (recognizes several non-

doubt. The scriptures compare them 
respectively to water mixed with colors,
 boiling water, water covered by moss, 
water whipped by wind, and muddy water.
<pb n="235"/>



<xa>ontology</xa>
In philosophy, the branch of metaphysics
 that deals with the notion of Being per
 se, as opposed to specific instances of
 it (such as God). Buddhist philosophy 
is somewhat allergic to the notion of 
Being in the sense of Western and/or 
Hindu philosophy, so most of what passes
 for ontological discourse in other 
philosophies would be considered 
unintelligible in Buddhism.



<xa>parinirvana</xa>
The end of the Buddha's physical 
existence (i.e., his death).



<xa>paticcasamuppada</xa>
Dependent origination. The twelve-stage 
process that leads from ignorance to

<pb n="236"/>
<xa>pratyekabuddha</xa>
A 'solitary awakened one'. Sometimes 
used as a term of reproof, to refer to 
students who get entangled in personal 
striving for illumination. One of the 
characteristic marks of pratyekabuddhas 
is that they do not teach.



<xa>Precepts</xa>
A basic set of standards for moral 
conduct: to refrain from killing, 
stealing, harmful sexual behavior, lying
 and the use of intoxicants. These are 
the five "normal" precepts for the laity
; more extensive sets may apply to 
persons in special circumstances, e.g. 
the monastic community.



<xa>Pure</xa>
See Amitabha.



<xa>samadhi</xa>

meditation.



<xa>samatha</xa>
'Calmness' meditation, a set of 
techniques for developing one-
pointedness of mind. Cf. samadhi and

<xa>samsara</xa>
(lit. 'wandering together') The wheel of
 suffering and rebirth.



<xa>samyojana</xa>
one of ten 'fetters' that tie beings to 
the wheel of birth and death. They are: 
belief in a substantial self, skeptical 
doubt, clinging to rules and ritual, 
sensual craving, ill will, craving for 
fine-material existence, craving for 
immaterial existence, conceit (mana), 
restlessness and ignorance. The first 
five are the 'lower' fetters; the second
<pb n="238"/>
 five are the 'upper' fetters. In the 
Stream Enterer the first three fetters 
have been destroyed; in the Once-
Returner the next two are weakened, and 
in the Non-Returner they are destroyed; 
in the Arahant all fetters have been 
destroyed.



<xa>Sangha</xa>
A word with several associations. One 
meaning refers specifically to the 
Aryasangha (Pali Ariyasangha -- those 
who have attained to the supramundane 
Path). Another meaning is the patimokkha
 sangha -- the community of ordained 
monks and nuns. Western Mahayanists 
sometimes use the word in yet a third 
sense, to refer to the "mahasangha" -- 
the community of all believers. The 
Sangha that is referred to in the Triple
 Gem is the Ariyasangha; from an 
orthodox viewpoint (whether Theravada or
 Mahayana), beings who have not cut off 
the defilements are not a satisfactory 
object of refuge.



<pb n="239"/>
<xa>sati</xa>
Mindfulness (as in the 'right 
mindfulness' of the Eightfold Path). 
Consciousness of/attention to experience
 here and now. Cf. vipassana and samadhi

<xa>sutra</xa>
In Theravada, a historical discourse of 
the Buddha as passed down by oral 
tradition and ultimately committed to 
writing (the Suttapitaka was not 
actually compiled in written form until 
circa 80 B.C.E., around the same time as
 the earliest Mahayana sutras were set 
down in writing). In Mahayana, the set 
of canonical sutras is enlarged to 
include some nonhistorical sermons -- 
the Heart Sutra, the Lotus Sutra, etc.

<xa>Three</xa>
All conditioned phenomena are 
unsatisfactory, impermanent and devoid 
of Self.



<xa>Three</xa>
Used as a synonym for the three 
unwholesome roots (q.v.). We are not 
aware of any use of this precise 
expression in the Pali Canon, but the 
English usage is fairly well established
. Not to be confused with the 'taints' (
see asava).



<xa>Three</xa>
three conditions that determine the 
<pb n="244"/>

emphasis on teacher-student relationship
.



<xa>vetulyavada</xa>
This term or one of its cognates (
vetulyaka, vetullaka, vaipulyavada, etc.
) is found in a few Theravada sources, e
.g. at Kathavatthu XXIII. Originally, 
the terms designated a pre- (possibly 
proto-) Mahayana doctrine that was 
regarded as heretical by the more 
orthodox. Later, some Theravada writers 
may have adopted it as a polemical label
 for Mahayana per se -- which is 
<pb n="246"/>
reminiscent of the history and use of 
the word 'hinayana' by certain Mahayana 
writers. See hinayana.



<xa>vipassana</xa>
Insight, seeing things as they are. Also
 used to refer to insight meditation, a 
technique that develops attention to the
 arising and passing away of conditioned
 phenomena (Theravada) or attention to 
the emptiness of conditioned phenomena (
Mahayana).



<xa>Zen</xa>

Vietnam, Japan and Korea (and of course 
various centers in the West).




<xa>Amitabha</xa>
阿彌陀佛
The Buddha of the Land of Ultimate Bliss
<pb n="247"/>
, the land created in the West through 
the power of his vows which enable 
living beings to be reborn simply 
through the power of constant 
mindfulness and recitation of his name.
aka Amida, Amita, and Amitayus. The word
 Amitabha is used in English to 
represent two Sanskrit terms, "Amitabha"
 ("Infinite Light") and "Amitayus" ("
Infinite Life"). Amitabha is the most 
commonly used name for the Buddha of 
Infinite Light and Infinite Life, "the 
archtype of cosmic compassion (T. Cleary
). A transhistorical Buddha venerated by
 all Mahayana schools (T'ien-T'ai, 
Esoteric, Zen) and, particulary, Pure 
Land. (He) presides over the Western 
Pure Land (Land of Ultimate Bliss) or 
Sukhavati, where anyone can be reborn 
through utterly sincere (i.e., 
singleminded) recitation of his name, 
particularly at the time of death.


<xa>Arhat</xa>
阿羅漢
One of the fruitions of the path of 
cultivation. Arhats have attained the 
cessation of involuntary physical birth 
and death. The word has three meanings: 
<pb n="248"/>
(1) worthy of offerings, (2) killer of 
thieves--arhats have killed the thieves 
of afflictions and outflows , and (3) 
free of birth.


<xa>Bodhisattva</xa>
菩薩
Those who aspire to Supreme 
Enlightenment and Buddhahood for 
themselves and all beings. The word 
Bodhisattva can therefore stand for 
realized beings such as Avalokitesvara 
or Samanthabhadra, but also for anyone 
who has developed the Bodhi Mind--the 
aspiration to save oneself and others.
An enlightened being who does not enter 
Nirvana but chooses instead to remain in
 the world and save living beings.


<xa>Bhikshu</xa>
比丘
A bhikshu is a fully ordained Buddhist 
monk. He is one who leads a pure and 
celibate life and upholds the 250

A bhikshuni is a fully ordained Buddhist
 nun. She is one who leads a pure and 
celibate life and upholds 348 precepts.


<xa>Buddhadharma</xa>
佛法
The teachings of the Buddha.


<xa>Cultivation,</xa>
As a famous quotation has it: "For 
teaching, develop your own school. For 
self-cultivation, practice Pure Land."
"In entering the Buddha Dharma, there 
are generally three approaches: teaching
, interpretation, and practice. 
Teachings are shallow, interpretation is
 profound, but practice is supreme (
Master Ching-yin Hui-yan)."
"A scholar who studies and 'teaches' a 
sutra with the intent of footnoting and 
categorizing it, instead of practicing 
it, is like a starving man who, given 
food, puts it under a microscope instead
 of eats it, and who teaches others to 
starve with him. "
In Buddhism, regardless of the school 
followed, practice (cultivation) is a 
<pb n="250"/>
must. A Buddhist who merely studies or 
lectures on the Buddha's teaching while 
failing to put it into practice has been
 likened to a sick doctor who prescribes
 medicines for others while refusing to 
take any himself. According to Buddhist 
teachings, we all have within us varying
 degrees of greed, anger, and delusion. 
To practice is to avoid or mitigate the 
conditions that promote greed, anger, 
and delusion. Thus, for example, 
whenever anger flares up, one's thoughts
 should be redirected, as a form of 
displacement, toward the Buddha through 
Buddha-remembrance (Buddha Recitation).
The cardinal rule of all Buddhist 
cultivation, regardless of tradition or 
school, is introspection--looking at 
your own mistakes and correcting them. 
To look at other people's shortcomings 
and criticize them is bound to disturb 
the mind and keep us in a perpetual 
state of anger and frustration.


<xa>Dharma</xa>
法
a) The teachings of the Buddhas (
generally this meaning of Dharma is 
capitalized in English); b) duty, law, 
<pb n="251"/>
doctrine; c) things, events, phenomena, 
everything.
The teaching of the Buddha (Shakyamuni),
 who recognized and formulated this "law
"; thus the teaching that expresses the 
universal truth. The dharma in this 
sense existed already before the birth 
of the historical Buddha (Shakyamuni), 
who is no more than a manifestation of 
it. It is the dharma in this sense that 
a Buddhist takes refuge.


<xa>Dhyana</xa>
禪那
It is said that one day Brahma, lord of 
creation, offered the Buddha a flower 
and asked him to preach the Dharma. When
 the Buddha held up the flower, his 
audience was puzzled, except for 
Kashyapa, who smiled. This is how ... (
dhyana} began. And this is how it was 
transmitted: with a flower, with a rock 
wall, with a shot. 
Dhyana is the Sanskrit word for Ch'an, 
itself the Chinese word for Zen. Zen was
 derived from the word Ch'an, which was 
derived from the word dhyana.


<pb n="252"/>
<xa>Earth</xa>
地藏菩薩
The Bodhisattva who saves suffering 
beings in the hells; he is especially 
popular in Japan as the saviour of the 
souls of dead children, particularly 
aborted ones. He is usually represented 
standing, holding in his right hand a 
pilgrim's staff, and in his left hand a 
pearl. He is also known by the name of 
Ksitigarbha.
Earth Store Bodhisattva or "Earth-Womb" 
Bodhisattva is more popular in the Far 
East than he ever was in India. From a 
bare mention in the roll of the Eight 
Bodhisattvas, he has risen, in Asia, and
 particularly in East Asia, to a 
popularity second only to Avalokitesvara
 (Kwan Yin Bodhisattva). Like all 
Bodhisattvas, he aspires to deliver 
sentient beings wandering astray in the 
five (or six) paths of mundane existence
; but he specializes in delivering them 
from hell... he takes upon himself the 
fearful task not merely of plumbing the 
depths of existence, and bringing relief
 and consolation to those in torment, 
but of personally transforming and 
uplifting the vast inchoate mass of fear
, hatred, and despair swarming and 
<pb n="253"/>
polluting in the pitch darkness of the 
Abyss.


<xa>Field</xa>
福田
A figurative term for someone who is 
worthy of offerings. Just as a field can
 yield crops, so people will obtain 
blessed karmic results if they make 
offerings to one who deserves them. 
There are many kinds of "fields of 
blessings": monks, enlightened beings, 
parents, the poor, etc, including 
animals.
Buddhas, bodhisattvas, arhats and all 
sentient beings, whether friends or foes
, are fields of merits for the 
cultivator because they provide him with
 an opportunity to cultivate merits and 
virtues. For example, needy people 
provide the opportunity for the 
cultivator to practice charity. Thus, 
they are fields of merits for him. As 
the Avatamsaka Sutra (chapter 40) states
, "Bodhi (Enlightenment) belongs to 
living beings. Without living beings, no
 bodhisattva could achieve Supreme, 
Perfect enlightenment."

<pb n="254"/>

<xa>Gwan</xa>
觀音菩薩
Known also as Avalokitesvara (Sanskrit) 
and Kuan Yin, Gwan Yin Bodhisattva is 
one of the Three Pure Land Sages, the 
other two being Buddha Amitabha and 
Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva. Amitabha 
Buddha is frequently depicted standing 
between Gwan Yin and Mahasthamaprapta...
 In some texts, Gwan Yin is referred to 
in the masculine form. However. the 
feminine form is commonly used to 
reflect popular East Asian imagery.
Gwan Yin is the Bodhisattva of 
Compassion, and is usually recognized by
 the small Buddha adorning her crown or 
headdress... In China, she is known as 
the "Goddess of Mercy." She is also 
known as the one who hears the sounds of
 the world, because she attained 
enlightenment by means of the faculty of
 hearing.
Gwan Yin's attainment of enlightenment 
by means of the faculty hearing is 
documented in the Shurangama Sutra.


<xa>Hsuan</xa>
宣化上人
<pb n="255"/>
The Venerable Master Hsuan Hua developed
 the inclination to cultivate early on 
in his childhood. Influenced by the 
filial piety of Filial Son Wong (Great 
Master Chang Ren) of Shuangcheng County,
 the Master vowed to follow his example.
 Every morning and evening after bowing 
to the Buddhas, he would make three bows
 to his parents. Later he took refuge 
with the Triple Jewel and had deep faith
 in Buddhism. When he was nineteen his 
mother passed away, and he lived in a 
tiny hut by her graveside for three 
years in observance of filial piety. At 
that time he left the home-life with 
Venerable Master Chang Zhi and 
cultivated quietly and earnestly. He 
travelled widely to study under Elder 
Masters of great virtue. Later he 
received the transmission of Dharma from
 Venerable Master Hsu Yun and became the
 Ninth Patriarch of the Wei Yang Sect, 
the forty-fifth generation since the 
First Patriarch Mahakashyapa. In 1949 
the Master went to Hong Kong to 
propagate the Dharma. He founded 
monasteries, delivered lectures on 
Sutras, and engaged in other activities 
to benefit living beings, thus causing 
Buddhism to flourish in Hong Kong. In 
<pb n="256"/>
1962 he came to America alone. 
Responding to the ripening conditions in
 the West, he worked to gradually 
actualize his vow to raise the banner of
 the Proper Dharma in the West.
The Venerable Master Hua's three great 
vows after leaving the home-life were (1
) to promote and develop education in 
the Buddhist tradition, (2) to translate
 the Buddhist Canon, and (3) to 
establish a foundation for Buddhism in 
America. In order to make these vows a 
reality, the Venerable Master based 
himself in the Three Great Principles 
and the Six Great Guidelines. 
Courageously facing every hardship, he 
founded monasteries, schools, and 
centers in the West, drawing in living 
beings and teaching them on a vast scale
. Over the years, he founded the 
following institutions: The City of Ten 
Thousand Buddhas, Instilling Goodness 
Elementary School, Developing Virtue 
Secondary School, Dharma Realm Buddhist 
University, Sangha and Laity Training 
Programs, Proper Dharma Buddhist Academy
, International Translation Institute, 
Administrative Headquarters of the 
Dharma Realm Buddhist Association, and 
Dharma Realm Buddhist Books Distribution
<pb n="257"/>
 Association, The Institute of World 
Religions, Affiliated Monasteries (
including this monastery, the Gold 
Summit Sagely Monastery).

Master Hsuan Hua can be found at these

the DRBA Web sites.


<xa>Icchantika</xa>
一闡提
According to early Buddhism, a sentient 
being who, being inherently unreceptive 
to the teachings of the Buddha, will 
never attain enlightenment. Later 
Mahayana tended to regard an icchantika 
as one who would ultimately attain 
Buddhahood, although his path would be 
difficult.
(An) unbeliever... a person who has cut 
all the wholesome roots... in himself 
and has no wish to attain Buddhahood.

(A Sanskrit word meaning) the human 
world. The world in which we are living.
 Also ancient name of India. 
<pb n="258"/>
Jambudvipa is a small part of the Saha 
World, the realm of Sakyamuni Buddha.
The 'Continent of the Jambu Tree,' so 
called because this continent is 
overlooked by a gigantic Jambu tree 
growing on the summit of Mount Sumeru. 
Jambudvipa is the southermost of the 
four continents, supposedly the world in
 which we humans live. It is said to be 
wide in the north and narrow in the 
south, shaped almost like an inverted 
triangle.

禪那
Alternative transliteration into English

<xa>Karma</xa>
羯磨，業
Deeds, activity. Karma does not mean 
fate. It means the deeds which we create
 ourselves and the retributions which 
those deeds bring upon us.
(Karma is) action leading to future 
retribution or reward or future 
lifetimes... The doctrine of karma is 
subtle and extremely intricate. Reduced 
<pb n="259"/>
to its most elementary meaning, karma is
 action; it refers also to the fruits of
 action. It may be seen as the law of 
causation on a personal level, a 
combination of primary and secondary 
causes... every thought, utterance, and 
deed is a seed that ripens over time 
until, under suitable conditions, it 
comes to fruition as an event or 
circumstance. It is, moreover, a 
continuous process, for the way in which
 one responds to these circumstances 
determines the quality of his present 
life as well as future ones. Thus, the 
doctrine of karma repudiates any notion 
of 'fate' or 'fixed destiny,' inasmuch 
as these circumstances and our response 
to them are constantly changing... The 
Buddha said, "If you want to know the 
past (cause), look at your present (
effect). If you want to know the future 
(effect), look at your present (cause)."
 
Poverty and want, for example, are the 
results of miserly thoughts and actions 
in past lives. For a destitute person to
 cheat and steal in order to escape 
poverty and become wealthy is a classic 
case of creating more evil karma in the 
hope of escaping retribution.
<pb n="260"/>
How do we reconcile bad happenings 
occuring to good people with the law of 
karma? The general answer is that karma 
extends over many lifetimes, and 
therefore our present good deeds may 
attenuate the bad results of past 
misdeeds but not necessarily eliminate 
them completely.

<xa>Lankavatara</xa>
楞伽經
A sutra which expounds the doctrines of 
the eight consciousnesses and Tathagatha
-matrix (womb). This is one of the 
sutras upon which the Zen and Yogacara 
schools are based. There are three 
extant Chinese versions.
A scripture of the Yogacara School of 
Mahayana Buddhism, written in Sanskrit 
in India (ca. 350 AD). Contains an 
epitome of nearly all Mahayana teaching.
 Teaches subjective idealism based on 
the Buddha's Enlightenment, and the 
doctrines of Sunyata and Mind-Only. Said
 to have been given by Bodhidharma to 
<pb n="261"/>
his disciple, the Second Patriarch, Hui-
K'o, as containing the Buddha's teaching
.


<xa>Maitreya</xa>
彌勒菩薩
A Bodhisattva predicted to succeed 
Shakyamuni as a future Buddha. Also 
called Ajita, meaning "invincible". Some
 accounts view him as a historical 
personage who preceded the Buddha in 
death. He is said to have been reborn in
 the Tushita Heaven where he is now 
expounding the Dharma to the heavenly 
beings in the inner palace. It is said 
that he will reappear in this world (
several billion years) after Shakyamuni'
s death, attain Buddhahood, and save the
 people in Shakyamuni's stead. For this 
reason he is also sometimes called 
Miroku Buddha.
Maitreya means "compassionate clan." He 
is also known as Ajita, "Invicible," 
because no heavenly demons or 
externalists can be victorious over him.
 Maitreya Bodhisattva dwells in the 
inner court of the Tushita heaven and 
cultivates "compassionate heart samadhi.
" Everyone who meets him brings forth a 
<pb n="262"/>
compassionate heart. Because he is 
compassionate towards all beings, all 
living beings are fond of him and loyal 
to him... When Shakyamuni Buddha steps 
down as teaching host of the Saha world,
 Maitreya will succeed him. When will 
this happen? Many externalists say, "
Maitreya Bodhisattva has come; Maitreya 
Bodhisattva has appeared in the world," 
but they are speaking in a dream. Why do
 I say this? Shakyamuni Buddha stated 
very clearly when Maitreya would come:
This present world kalpa is now in a 
period of decrease. Every hundred years,
 man's average lifespan decreases by one
 year and his height by one inch. When 
man's average lifespan is ten years, the
 period of increase will begin again and
 every hundred years man's height will 
increase one inch and his average 
lifespan will increase by one year. When
 man's lifespan has reached eighty-four 
thousand years, the period of decline 
will begin again and, when man's 
lifespan has decreased to eighty-
thousand years, Maitreya Bodhisattva 
will appear in the world.


<xa>Nirvana</xa>
<pb n="263"/>
涅槃
Perfect quiescence realized by 
enlightened sages.
"Originally, nirvana meant total 
extinction of desire and suffering. 
Today it refers to the state of 
liberation through full enlightenment. 
In Mahayana (Buddhism), nirvana is 
classified into four categories: 1. 
Nirvana with residue, the state of a 
person who has realized the nature of 
nirvana, but has not yet eliminated the 
five aggregates; 2. Nirvana without 
residue, wherein the aggregates have 
been eliminated; 3. Svabhava nirvana, 
the primeval nirvana which is always 
present, whether we realize it or not; 
and 4. Nonabiding nirvana, in which one 
abides in neither samsara nor ultimate 
quiescence. This is the nirvana of the 
Buddhas and the highest Bodhisattvas."


<xa>Outflows</xa>
All bad habits and faults are outflows. 
Outflows are the root of birth and death

<xa>Paramita</xa>
<pb n="264"/>
波羅蜜多
Some say it is as sweet as pineapple. (
Pineapple,  (in Mandarin Chinese) po lo 
kuo, and paramita, po lo mi, contain the
 same characters, po lo. Mi means "sweet
"; thus the pun, "sweet as pineapple.") 
Not only that, it is the sweetest of 
sweets. It is separation from suffering 
and attainment of bliss. Whenever a task
 is well done the people of India say it
 is "paramita," just as we would say it 
is "finished." But paramita means more 
than just finished. It means the task 
has been perfectly accomplished.
Paramita means "arrived at the other 
shore." If you take a bridge or ferry 
from San Francisco to Oakland, your 
arrival in Oakland is "paramita." 
Receiving a certificate of promotion 
from elementary school is "paramita." 
Obtaining a high school diploma is "
paramita." Acquiring a Bachelors degree 
is "paramita." A Masters degree, a 
Doctorate, are also "paramita." At 
present we are on "this shore" of birth 
and death. By passing through the sea of
 suffering we can arrive at the other 
shore of Nirvana. This is also "paramita
."

"Green bamboo... yellow flowers... 
Everything is prajna." The Sanskrit word
 prajna is included among the Five Kinds

盂蘭盆節
A Buddhist festival... of the hungry 
ghosts, celebrated on the fifteenth day 
of the seventh month (lunar calendar). 
On this day ceremonies are held in which
 the sutras are recited in order to 
soothe the torments of the deceased in 
the lower realms of existence. The 
origin of this ceremony is to be found 
in the story of Maudgalyayana, who 
thanks to his "divine eye" saw that his 
mother had been reborn as a hungry ghost
<pb n="271"/>
, and he wanted to save her. The Buddha 
told him that only the combined effort 
of all Buddhist monks could (help her 
escape her fate). From this tradition 
developed the custom of offering food, 
clothing, and so on to the (clergy on 
Ullambana, the date of which coincides 
with the end of the yearly Rains Retreat
). The combination of the Buddhist world
 view and the Chinese custom of ancestor
 veneration explains the tremendous 
popularity of this festival in East Asia
, in which not only Buddhists but also 
Taoists and Confucians participate.

Recitation Samadhi念佛三昧</_-xa>

"The Sanskrit prefix 'A' means 'not', 
the negative. Before another vowel a 
consonant may be added. (Humphrey)." The
 meditation on the Sanskrit letter "A" 
is the most important meditation in 
Esoteric Buddhism.
"The entire system of doctrine and 
practice set forth in the Mahavairocana 
Sutra (key text in Esoteric Buddhism) is
 symbolized in concentrated form in the 
single seed syllable 'A'. The commentary
 on the Mahavairocana Sutra says, 'The '
A' syllable gate is the king of all 
mantras.' (T. Yamasaki, Shingon)." 
"The sound 'A' is regarded as the source
 from which all words are produced. It 
is therefore termed the 'mother of all 
sounds'. It exemplifies the Mahayana 
doctrine that the world of change is 
immediately the realm of ultimate 
reality or, in other words, Samsara is 
identical with Nirvana. 'A' is also 
<pb n="276"/>
employed to suggest the idea of the 
evolution of all phenomena from (
thusness). In Esoteric Buddhism, it 
symbolizes the unity of the whole world.
 Thence it is identified with Vairocana,
 (the primordial) Buddha." 
Buddhism of Wisdom ＆ Faith/ excerpts:
"If the mind is very unsettled and we 
cannot use (Buddha Recitation), we 
should, with each utterance, concentrate
 firmly on the letter 'A' in Amitabha 
Buddha. When the letter 'A' is present, 
all the other letters are also present. 
If, because of delusion and 
forgetfulness, the letter 'A' is lost, 
all the other letters are also lost. 
Moreover, the letter 'A' is the key and 
fundamental letter of the alphabet and 
is therefore considered the mother of 
all other letters. Through concentration
 on reciting the Buddha's name while 
simultaneously holding fast to the 
letter 'A', eventually mind and 
environment both dissolve and amalgamate
 into one bloc, as great as space itself
. Buddha Amitabha and the practitioner 
will then both disappear. At that time, 
naturally, the letter 'A' will have 
ceased to exist as well. However, it was
 lost earlier because the mind was 
<pb n="277"/>
unsettled and scattered, while it no 
longer exists now precisely because of 
the harmonious state of 'perpetual 
concentration.' This is the 
manifestation of emptiness of Mind and 
environment -- the entry point into the 
Buddha Recitation Samadhi (q.v.)."

<xa>ABHIDHARMA，阿毗達磨</xa>
<_-xa>Tripitaka</_-xa>; <_-xa>Sastra</_-xa>

"Lit. Higher Dhamma (Dharma). The third

and Mahayana Schools. It is largely a 
commentary on the sermons or sutras, and
 subjects them to analysis. 
Philosophical and psychological, it 
contains an entire system of mind 
training." 
In Buddhism, commentaries and treatises 
are of two types: (1) the Abhidharma 
contains mainly, though not exclusively,
 the commentaries expounded by Buddha 
<pb n="278"/>
Sakyamuni and recited at the First 
Council, held in 483 B.C., the year of 
the Buddha's passing. Maha-Kasyapa, the

 It is codified in the third basket of 
both the Theravada and Mahayana canons; 
(2) Sastras are later commentaries and 
treatises, written by Mahayana 
patriarchs such as Nagarjuna (2nd/3rd B.
C.), Asangha and Vasabandu (5th century)
 to explain important points in the 
teachings of the Buddha. (An important 
sastra, for example, is the Awakening of

Buddhist canonical scriptures, in the 
Vinaya-Pitaka, as a grave offence. If 
abortion is brought about by a Buddhist 
monk, or if he is in any way a party to 
the procuring of an abortion by offering
<pb n="279"/>
 advice as to the methods or supplying 
abortive medicine, penalty is expulsion 
from monkhood. This is in accordance 
with Buddhist view that destruction of 
life is a moral transgression." 
Ling:7
"According to Buddhist tenets, the life 
cycle of a sentient being begins when 
the consciousness enters the womb, and 
traditionally this has been considered 
the moment of conception. Therefore, 
there is no objection to contraception 
which interferes with conception without
 damaging sentient life. Termination of 
pregnancy, on the other hand, 
necessarily occurs after conception, so 
it is not advised." 
"As a scholar, Dr. R. Thurman (q.v.) is 
especially critical of fuzzy thinking in
 popular Buddhism. As an example, he 
cites a 1992 article in Tricycle by 
Helen Tworkov, the magazine's editor, in
 which Tworkov acknowledges strong anti-
abortion teachings in Buddhism but also 
writes that 'Dharma teachings can be 
used to validate either pro-choice or 
anti-abortion politics.' To Thurman, '
that's simply incorrect. It's the taking
 of life. The fundamentalists do have it
 emotionally right -- the killing of 
<pb n="280"/>
fetuses is a mass massacre from the 
Buddhist point of view. It is not a 
fuzzy issue in Buddhism.' (R. Kamenetz)"

<_-xa>North America (Buddhism in)</_-xa>; 
<_-xa>Europe (Buddhism in)</_-xa>

"Early interest in the Mahayana, 
stimulated by the discovery of Sankrit 
texts from Nepal and the work of Eugene 
Burnouf and other scholars, had rather 
weakened by the end of the nineteenth 
century. This was due to the natural 
enthusiasm at the discovery of the Pali 
literature. A number of scholars active 
during the first half of the twentieth 
century sought to re-emphasize the value
 of works available in Chinese and 
Tibetan translation. Many of these 
represent North Indian traditions just 
as ancient as those from Sri Lanka. One 
group of scholars working in Russia was 
especially associated with the name of T
. Shcherbatsky. Influenced by contact 
with the living tradition of Northern 
Buddhism, they sought to comprehend 
<pb n="281"/>
Buddhist thought in terms of European 
philosophical development. A second 
group, composed mainly of Belgian and 
French scholars, was more interested in 
the Mahayana as a religion and in the 
history of Buddhism. The most 
influential writer of this group was 
probably Louis de La Vallee Poussin... 
The period (following) the Second World 
War has seen a strong continuance of 
this Franco-Belgian school, most notably
 with the work of E. Lamotte. Moreover 
the researches in Tibet of the Italian 
scholar, G. Tucci, have given a new 
impetus to studies of Northern Buddhism.
 Important contributions have been made 
by scholars from India, especially in 
the study of Buddhist philosophy and 
history, and by Japanese scholars 
notably in the field of Eastern Buddhism
. At the same time new discoveries from 
the sands of Central Asia, the caves of 
Tun-huang, Gilgit in Kashmir and from 
the libraries of Nepal and Tibet have 
recovered lost Buddhist literature and 
opened up new fields for research. Text-
critical and historical studies using 
these new materials have been developed,
 especially in Germany. The recent 
expansion of Buddhist studies in North 
<pb n="282"/>
America seems likely to develop new 
approaches (Tantric school, Pure Land 
school, Women Studies, etc.)." 
Pure Land School 
Unlike Zen or Tibetan Buddhism, Pure 
Land Buddhism is still little known in 
the West. However, it is the most 
popular school in Asia. Although Pure 
Land is sometimes looked upon as a 
basically popular form of Buddhism, it 
actually covers all strata of 
practitioners. For some practitioners, 
Pure Land is synonymous with complete 
reliance on other-power, the power of 
Amitabha Buddha. For others, Pure Land 
is Mind -- it is Mind created, Mind-only
. (see Pure Land School).

(A legal term.) "From the Buddhist point

related to the thoughts and actions 
primarily of human beings. Man and his 
environment are not separate; they are 
mutually conditioning -two aspects of 
one reality. Each of our thoughts 
pulsates with the heartbeat of the 
cosmos, and the universe in turn is 
affected by and reflects our thoughts 
and actions. We cannot ravage and 
pollute the earth, upsetting the balance
 of the forces of nature -our own nature
 - without repercussions from the earth.
 C.G. Jung was quoted in a 1971 article 
in the New York Times as saying (
following an earthquake that destroyed 
many Chilian cities), 'Even though today
<pb n="284"/>
's scientists may reject the idea, the 
earth seems to be in tune with the 
destructive fury of mankind.' But this 
is only half the equation. Through man's
 pollution of the atmosphere and the 
soil, the very air he breathes and the 
food he eats poison him, eliciting from 
his body a similar protest in the form 
of pollution diseases, the foremost of 
which may be cancer. Thus the circle of 
destruction is complete."

"The passions and ignorance that cause 
<pb n="287"/>
one to wander in Samsara and hinder one 
from reaching enlightenment. The word '
afflictions' emphasizes the effects of 
defilements. One list of the basic 
defilements names six: greed, hatred (or
 anger), ignorance (or delusion), 
arrogance, doubt, and wrong (evil) views
." 
The basic goal of Buddhist teachings is 
to keep the mind empty and still so that
 our innate wisdom can manifest itself. 
(A Buddha is all wisdom at all times.) 
Thus, Buddhism fosters practices and 
habits that subdue passions and simplify
 life, freeing the cultivator for 
spiritual pursuits. It is in this 
context that sexual desire, excessive 
rest and sleep, etc. are considered 
afflictions.  
Buddha Sakyamuni compared human beings 
chasing after the fleeting pleasures of 
this world to a child licking honey off 
a sharp knife. There is no way they can 
avoid hurting themselves. "They are like
 men who carry torches against a strong 
wind; the flame will surely burn their 
hands and faces."
Subduing Afflictions
Buddhism of Wisdom ＆ Faith/excerpts:
"The karmas of greed, anger and delusion
<pb n="288"/>
 manifest themselves in many forms, 
which are impossible to describe fully. 
I will discuss, in general, four basic 
ways to subdue them. 
I. SUPPRESSING AFFLICTIONS WITH THE MIND
. There are only two points of 
divergence between the deluded and the 
enlightened (i.e., Buddhas and 
Bodhisattvas): purity is Buddhahood, 
defilement is the state of sentient 
beings. Because the Buddhas are in 
accord with the Pure Mind, they are 
enlightened, fully endowed with 
spiritual powers and wisdom. Because 
sentient beings are attached to worldly 
Dusts, they are deluded and revolve in 
the cycle of Birth and Death. To 
practice Pure Land is to go deep into 
the Buddha Recitation Samadhi, awakening
 to the Original Mind and attaining 
Buddhahood. Therefore, if any deluded, 
agitated thought develops during Buddha 
Recitation, it should be severed 
immediately, allowing us to return to 
the state of the Pure Mind. This is 
counteracting afflictions with the mind.
II. SUPPRESSING AFFLICTIONS WITH 
NOUMENON. When deluded thoughts arise 
which cannot be suppressed with the mind
, we should move to the second stage and
<pb n="289"/>
 'visualize principles.' For example 
whenever the affliction of greed 
develops, we should visualize the 
principles of impurity, suffering, 
impermanence, No-Self. Whenever the 
affliction of anger arises, we should 
visualize the principles of compassion, 
forgiveness and emptiness of all dharmas
.
III. SUPPRESSING AFFLICTIONS WITH 
PHENOMENA. Persons with heavy karma who 
cannot suppress their afflictions by 
visualizing principles alone should use 
phenomena, that is, external forms. For 
example, individuals who are prone to 
anger and delusion and are aware of 
their shortcomings, should, when they 
are on the verge of bursting into a 
quarrel, immediately leave the scene and
 slowly sip a glass of cold water. Those
 heavily afflicted with the karma of 
lust-attachment who cannot suppress 
their afflictions through 'visualization
 of principle,' should arrange to be 
near virtuous Elders and concentrate on 
Buddhist activities or distant travel, 
to overcome lust and memories gradually.
 The saying 'absence makes the heart 
grow fonder,' should really read 'out of
 sight, out of mind.' This is because 
<pb n="290"/>
sentient beings' minds closely parallel 
their surroundings and environment. If 
the surroundings disappear, the mind 
loses its anchor, and, gradually, all 
memories fade. 
IV. SUPPRESSING AFFLICTIONS WITH 
REPENTANCE AND RECITATION. In addition 
to the above three methods, which range 
from the subtle to the gross, there is a
 fourth: repentance and the recitation 
of sutras, mantras and Amitabha Buddha's
 name. If performed regularly, 
repentance and recitation eradicate bad 
karma and generate merit and wisdom... 
Depending on circumstances, the 
practitioner can use any of these four 
methods to counteract the karma of greed
, anger and delusion in a general way. 
If these methods are practiced patiently
 and in earnest, there is nothing that 
cannot be accomplished." 



<xa>AFFLICTIONS</xa>
<_-xa>Samsara is Nirvana</_-xa> 
<_-xa>Ultimatism</_-xa>

A Mahayana teaching of the highest level
, for those already awakened / 
<pb n="291"/>
enlightened (see Ultimatism for 
explanation).
"A basic Zen teaching. Afflictions are 
inseparable from Buddhahood. (At the 
noumenon or the theoretical level), 
afflictions and Buddhahood are 
considered to be two sides of the same 
coin. Since all existence has the 
tathata (thusness) as its underlying 
essence, afflictions too must rest on 
this tathata. Enlightenment, i.e., 
identity with the tathata, is achieved 
only when one realizes that afflictions 
in themselves can have no real, 
independent existence. The doctrine is 
considered to express the ultimate 
teaching of Mahayana." 
Turn Affliction into Bodhi 
This is a key Mahayana concept. As an 
example, supposing a woman returns home,
 only to discover that her only child 
has suddenly died. This is the worst 
affliction imaginable. Yet, if through 
this affliction she understands that 
disease and death are the common lot of 
all sentient beings, she will have 
realized the truth of impermanence. She 
will have turned an affliction (loss of 
a loved one) into Bodhi (Enlightenment).

<xa>AGADA，阿伽陀</xa>

<_-xa>Pure Land Buddhism</_-xa>

A panacea, a cure-all, a remedy for all 
diseases and evils. All methods and 
schools of Buddhism are best -- best for
 a particular group, at a particular 
time. This is why the Buddha extolled 
all sutras as being foremost, as being 
kings of the Dharma. Of all these 
methods and schools, the one that is 
considered foremost and at the same time
 a panacea is Pure Land. Pure Land is a 
cure-all because it applies to people of
 all capacities and walks of life. 



<xa>AGAMA，阿伽摩/阿含</xa>
"Often used as a generic term for the

"A king of Magadha in Shakyamuni's day. 
While still a prince, he became friendly
 with Devadatta, who incited him to have
<pb n="296"/>
 his father Bimbisara killed and become 
king in his stead. He made Magadha into 
the most powerful kingdom in India. 
Later he converted to Buddhism and 
supported the First Buddhist Council for
 the compilation of Buddha Shakyamuni's 
teachings. According to the Nirvana 
Sutra, since King Bimbisara had no heir 
by his wife Vaidehi, he consulted a 
diviner, who said that there was a 
hermit presently living in the mountains
 who, after he died, would be reborn as 
Bimbisara's son. Bimbisara was so 
impatient for the birth of an heir that 
he had the hermit killed. Shortly after,
 Vaidehi conceived, but the diviner 
foretold that the child would become the
 king's enemy.' In fear of this child, 
the king dropped him from atop a tower (
but the child survived the fall)... It 
is said that as a young man Ajatasatru 
was persuaded to rebel against his 
father by Devadatta, who told him the 
story of his birth." 
"Ajatasattu's name means 'enemy before 
birth,' which according to the legend, 
derives from his mother's wish to drink 
blood from the knee of her husband (when
 she was pregnant with him). This was 
interpreted by the astrologers to mean 
<pb n="297"/>
that her child would kill his father.
Ajatasattu is described as an ambitious 
prince who wanted to become ruler of the
 kingdom as quickly as possible and 
could not wait for the death of his 
father. Together with Devadatta, he 
contrived a double conspiracy: since 
Devadatta was eager to take over the 
leadership of the Buddhist order, he was
 to murder the Buddha, and Ajatasattu 
was to kill his own father. The plot was
 discovered. Bimbisara pardoned his son 
and ceded him the throne. Ajatasattu, 
nevertheless, did not feel secure with 
his father still alive and had him 
incarcerated and starved together with 
his wife, Queen Vaidehi." 
"After Bimbisara's death Ajatasatru came
 to regret his conduct deeply. Tormented
 by guilt over the death of his father, 
he broke out in virulent sores during 
the second month of his fiftieth year, 
and it was predicted that he would die 
in the third month. At the advice of his
 physician and minister Jivaka, he 
sought out Shakyamuni Buddha who taught 
him the doctrines of the Nirvana Sutra, 
enabling him to eradicate his evil karma
 and prolong his life."

<pb n="298"/>
NOTE: The story of Ajatasatru has been 
immortalized in the prologue of the 
Meditation Sutra, one of the three core 
texts of the Pure Land school.

century. It is composed of seven 
fascicles and is a collection of 
references to Amitabha Buddha and his

two hundred texts are mentioned by name.
 It is of great value for materials

<xa>AMIDA-JI，阿彌陀寺</xa>
One of the most common names of the 
<pb n="304"/>
temples in Japan, especially those of 
Pure Land Buddhism. Amida is the 
Japanese transcription of the word 
Amitabha who is the primary Buddha of 
this school. (Five of the most popular 
Amida-Ji are:) 
(1) The Amida-ji in Suo Prefecture (
presently Yamaguchi prefecture). It is 
in Mure village, Saha-gun, Yamaguchi of 
western Japan. Its full name is Keguzan 
Amidaji. It belongs to the Kogi Shingon-
shu (or orthodox Mantrayana school), the
 main temple of which is Koyasan. This 
temple shows a good example of the 
relation of Buddhism and the state. The 
temple was founded in 1180 A. D. by Shun
-jobo Chogen who was the reconstructor 
of Daibutsu in Nara. The history of this
 temple during the middle ages is not 
quite clear. But in the Kanbun period ( 
1661-1673 A.D.), it was reconstructed 
just as it is seen now, and converted to
 the Shingon-shu from the Jodo-shu. (
Festival: July 14-15.) 
(2) The Amida-ji in Yamashiro Prefecture
 (presently Kyoto Prefecture). It is in 
Kochiya, Atago-gun, Kyoto of central 
Japan. It was founded by Tanzei in the 
early l7th century along with the other 
Amida-jis founded by him in many 
<pb n="305"/>
districts of Japan. Of them this is the 
largest and most famous; its full name 
is Isshinki-myoketsujo Komyozan. It 
belongs to the Jodo sect. This is a very
 silent and quiet place with many old 
and big pine trees in its park. Some of 
these trees are especially famous 
because of their legends connected with 
the founder, Tanzei. The 25th of May is 
the festival day of this temple. 
(3) The Amida-ji in Sagami Prefecture (
presently Kanagawa Prefecture). It is in
 Tonosawa village. Ashigara-gun, 
Kanagawa Prefecture of eastern Japan. 
This also was founded (1632 A. C.) by 
Tanzei and was supported by the count of
 Sagami. In the park there is the so-
called Asoka stupa. 
(4) The Amida-ji in Kyoto, viz., 
Rendaizan Amida-ji. It belongs to the 
Jodo sect and was founded in the Tenmon 
period (15321555.) by Seigyoku. Formerly
 it was in Omi Prefecture (presently 
Shiga Prefecture) and transferred here 
in 1585. 
(5) The Amida-ji in Nagato Prefecture. 
It is in Shimonoseki city, Yamaguchi 
Prefecture, western Japan. It was built 
for the delight of the young emperor 
Antoku, who died in the last battle 
<pb n="306"/>
between the Taira and Minamoto clans. It
 became popular after Lafcadio Hearn 
wrote about it. It first belonged to the
 Tendai sect, but was later converted 
into Shingon and then into Jodo. After 
the separation of Buddhism and Shintoism
 in 1875. The temple was forcibly 
converted into a Shinto shrine (current 
name of temple is Akamanomiya). (

Chin/ O-Mi-T'o-Fo; Jpn/ Amida; Vn/ A-Di-
<pb n="307"/>
Da. The word Amitabha is used in English
 to represent two Sanskrit terms,
"Amitabha" ("Infinite Light") and "
Amitayus" ("Infinite Life"). Amitabha is
 the most commonly used name for the 
Buddha of Infinite Light and Infinite 
Life, "the archetype of cosmic 
compassion" (T. Cleary). A 
transhistorical Buddha venerated by all 
Mahayana schools (T'ien-T'ai, Esoteric, 
Zen ...) and, particularly, Pure Land. 
Presides over the Western Pure Land (
Land of Ultimate Bliss) or Sukhavati, 
where anyone can be reborn through 
utterly sincere (i.e., singleminded) 
recitation of his name, particularly at 
the time of death. 
"About the middle of the 7th century in 
China, Amitabha replaced Shakyamuni and 
Maitreya as the supreme object of 
popular devotion. Associated with 
Amitabha were the two great Bodhisattvas
, Mahasthamaprapta and Avalokitesvara (
Kuan Yin)." 
"Although (Amitabha) Buddha figures 
prominently in a very large number of 
Mahayana sutras, the three principal 
sutras (in terms of later Buddhism) of 
the Pure Land school are the two 
Amitabha Sutras and the Meditation Sutra
<pb n="308"/>
. The religious faith within Buddhism 
that is oriented to the personality of 
this particular Buddha is known as 'the 
Pure Land teaching'. It is generally 
believed that both Nagarjuna (2nd-3rd c.
) and Vasubandhu (5th-6th c.) in India 
held to this faith." 
"The Fourth of the Dhyani (Esoteric) 
Buddhas. The personification of 
Compassion. In the Pure Land schools of 
China and Japan, Amitabha is the 
intermediary between Supreme Reality and
 mankind, and faith in him ensures 
rebirth in his Paradise (Sukhavati). 
Symbolically, Amitabha is Higher Self (
or Self-Nature)." 
Amitabha Buddha at the higher or 
noumenon level represents the True Mind,
 the Self-Nature common to the Buddhas 
and sentient beings -- infinitely bright
 and everlasting. This deeper 
understanding provides the rationale for
 the harmonization of Zen and Pure Land,
 two of the most popular schools of 
Mahayana Buddhism.
I.. BUDDHA vs. CREATOR-GOD
"Although the tone of Pure Land Buddhist
 devotion may be theistic... its content
 is clearly Buddhist. Amita Buddha is 
both like and unlike a Supreme Being or 
<pb n="309"/>
God in the following respects: 1) He is 
unique in his own realm (the Pure Land),
 but he is not unique in the universe as
 a whole, being only one of many Buddhas
, each unique in his own realm (Buddha-
land) and each having distinctive 
properties. (2) He is the creator of his
 realm, the source of all good in it, 
and the parent-like protector and helper
 (or savior) of its inhabitants, but he 
does not create, sustain, or destroy the
 universe as a whole, nor is he the 
ontological support (a 'Ground of Being'
) for the universe as a whole. (3) He is
 omniscient and all-seeing within and 
outside of his realm and is especially 
concerned with knowing human activity, 
so that he may remove ignorance; but he 
does not judge or punish. (4) He is 
outside 'this world'; he is visualized 
as living in a paradise in the sky and 
is 'Other Power'--that is, other than
the passionate, defiled mind of the 
practitioner; but he does not stand 
above the worshiper as an ontologically 
'Higher Power.' (5) His life is 
immeasurably long, but his life is not 
infinite, since there was a time when he
 was not a Buddha."

<pb n="310"/>
II. PURE LAND IN THE TRIPITAKA
In the Encyclopedia of Buddhism, Vol. I,
 Dr. G.P. Malalasekera, founding 
president of the World Fellowship of 
Buddhists, quotes a Japanese author who 
found in the Tripitaka two hundred texts
 referring to Amitabha Buddha and His 
Pure Land (thirty-one of the texts are 
in Sanskrit).
"Thirty-one Sanskrit texts and over (two
) hundred Chinese and Tibetan 
translations refer to Amitabha and/or 
Sukhavati. For example, the author of 
the Treatise on the Buddha-womb Theory 
concludes his highly technical work on 
the tathagatagarbha (Buddha-womb or 
embryo) doctrine by stating: 'By the 
merit I have acquired through (writing) 
this (treatise), may all living beings 
come to perceive the Lord Amitabha 
endowed with infinite light.' Such 
references attest to the influence 
wielded by Pure Land thought in the 
devotional lives of the commentators." 

III. NOTE:
"In the sutra Rebirth According to One's
 Vows, Buddha Sakyamuni was asked by a 
Bodhisattva, 'Honored One! There are 
pure lands in all ten directions. Why do
<pb n="311"/>
 you especially extol the Western Pure 
Land and urge sentient beings to focus 
continuously on Amitabha Buddha, seeking
 rebirth in His Land?' The Buddha 
replied, 'Sentient beings in this Saha 
World generally have polluted, scattered
 minds. Therefore, I extol only the Pure
 Land of the West, focussing their minds
 on a single realm. If they meditate on 
all Buddhas, the scope of attention will
 be too broad, their minds will be lost 
and scattered and they will find samadhi
 difficult to attain. Thus, they will 
fail to achieve rebirth in the Pure Land
.' Furthermore, seeking the virtues of 
one Buddha is the same as seeking the 
virtues of all Buddhas -- as all Buddhas
 have one common Dharma Nature. That is 
why to focus on Amitabha Buddha is to 
focus on all Buddhas, to be born in the 
Western Pure Land is to be born in all 
pure lands.'" P.L.

for details.

is entitled 'Amitabha Sutra' and 
consists of one fascicle. (It is the one
 most commonly used nowadays.) The 
<pb n="313"/>
Amitabha Sutra is one of the Three Pure 
Land Sutras (q.v.), together with the 
Longer Amitabha Sutra and the Meditation
 Sutra. 
I. SUMMARY
"Written in the form of a discourse by 
Shakyamuni to Shariputra and others at 
the Jetavana Monastery, the Amitabha 
Sutra describes the blessings and 
virtues of Amitabha Buddha and his Pure 
Land of Perfect Bliss in the western 
region of the universe. It further 
teaches that one can attain rebirth in 
this Pure Land by relying on Amitabha. 
Subsequently the Buddhas in the Six 
Directions are described as bearing 
witness to the truth of Shakyamuni's 
teaching." 
"The Amitabha Sutra is an address 
delivered by Shakyamuni to Shariputra in
 the Jeta grove near Sravasti. Like the 
Longer Amitabha Sutra, which it may 
slightly predate, this sutra deals 
mainly with a description of the Pure 
Land -- the gorgeous palaces, parks, and
 gardens; the gem trees made of gold, 
silver, crystal, and coral; the fragrant
 flowers and luscious fruits; the rivers
 and lotus lakes with their perfumed 
water that is either hot or cold for 
<pb n="314"/>
bathing as desired; the delightful, 
soothing sounds of birds and angelic 
singers. The major difference between 
the two sutras lies in the fact that the
 Shorter Amitabha Sutra (emphasizes) 
salvation through faith and the 
recitation of Amida's name (Buddha 
Recitation, q.v.), rather than through 
works." 
II. BACKGROUND
"The story of the Amitabha Sutra is set 
in a world of tradition and myth. Time 
and location, temporal and spatial 
dimensions, are without question of a 
special kind--one that we could perhaps 
call sacral or mythical, for lack of a 
better word. Extraordinary rules and 
boundaries also apply to body and action
, spirit and matter, the ideal and the 
real. Access to these special dimensions
 of reality is possible through a set of
 assumptions about the world and the 
beings that inhabit it and through an 
accompanying belief and confidence in 
the spiritual realities and processes 
embodied in the mythology. Among many 
differences between the world view of 
the two texts and the world view of 
contemporary Western secular culture, 
two stand out as central to 
<pb n="315"/>
understanding the message of the two 
sutras. First, existence after death is 
a given; but it is not simply an 
extension of human life. Existence after
 death means the possibility--or rather,
 the reality--of many lives, in a 
variety of realms other than our world, 
and in a variety of roles or '
incarnations' that include rebirth as an
 animal, as a hungry ghost, or in one of
 many paradises, or rebirth in a hell or
 purgatory, and rebirth in other world 
systems as well. Second, the process of 
rebirth is for most of us sentient 
beings an unending cycle of suffering. 
This cycle would be a desperate, 
hopeless, and meaningless eternal return
 if it were not for the possibility of 
deliverance. The moral and spiritual 
quality of our lives can have a 
significant effect on the course of our 
wandering through the many rounds of 
rebirth. Human beings who attain moral 
and spiritual perfection may in fact 
attain liberation from the cycle of 
rebirth. Those who attain liberation 
through their own spiritual effort are 
the Buddhas of the universe. In turn, 
the moral and spiritual quality of 
Buddhas can also have a significant 
<pb n="316"/>
effect on the course o f our journey 
through the many stations of rebirth--in
 other words, the liberation of Buddhas 
facilitates the liberation of other, 
less perfect sentient beings. Much of 
Mahayana Buddhist literature is devoted 
to these two issues: the manner in which
 human beings attain the perfection of 
Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and the manner
 in which Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 
assist other beings in their quest for 
liberation from suffering." 
III. AMITABHA SUTRA / LOTUS SUTRA 
"The Lotus Sutra is the Amitabha Sutra 
preached in detail, and the Amitabha 
Sutra is the Lotus Sutra in summary. In 
contrast to other sutras which expound 
many terms in connection with the nature
 and characteristics of things and 
persuade people to understand the 
principles and to work on self-
cultivation, these two sutras deal only 
with perception of phenomenal reality by
 the direct reasoning mind. In the 
Amitabha Sutra, Buddha said, 'If there 
is a good man or a good woman who hears 
someone speak of Buddha Amitabha and 
holds firmly his name... when this 
person approaches the hour of death, 
Buddha Amitabha and his holy company 
<pb n="317"/>
will manifest themselves in front of him
. This person, since he is not confused,
 will be reborn in the most blissful 
country of Buddha Amitabha.'.. To quote 
from the 23rd chapter of the Lotus Sutra
, 'Anyone who hears this Sutra and 
practices accordingly, when his present 
life ends, will go to the Western 
Paradise.' The similarity of these two 
passages is apparent. Other descriptions
 in the Amitabha Sutra of the grandeur 
and splendor of the Land, of Buddha's 
life, of Buddha's radiance and of the 
protection and care by the Buddhas of 
the Six Directions, though different in 
comprehensiveness and language, are, in 
fact, identical in their content and 
significance. Therefore, one invocation 
of Buddha Amitabha's name represents the
 supreme Dharma and covers unlimited 
approaches."

the Vimalakirti Sutra." 
"Not long before the Parinirvana of the 
Buddha, Amrapali, the famous courtesan

renounced the throne to study Buddhism 
earnestly." 
"An Shih-kao is the first historical 
figure of Chinese Buddhism. He initiated
 the systematic translation of Buddhist 
texts through so-called 'translation 
<pb n="319"/>
bureaus.' Records concerning the number 
of works he translated vary between 34 
and 176. These works may be divided into
 two categories: (1) texts on the 
practice of dhyana (meditation), which 
also treat preparatory techniques such 
as counting the breath, mindfulness of 
body, and so forth; and (2) texts that 
treat enumerated categories like the 
five skandhas. An Shih-kao used many 
Taoistic terms in his translations in an
 effort to convey specialized Buddhist 
expressions in Chinese."

"Non-returning. The third of the four

<xa>ANANDA，阿難</xa>
<_-xa>Buddhist Councils，結集</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Tripitaka，三藏</_-xa>; <_-xa>Sunaksatra，阿難</_-xa>

"A cousin of the Buddha, the brother of 
Devadatta (q.v.). One of the ten great 
disciples of the Buddha. Ananda 
accompanied the Buddha for more than 
twenty years and was the Master's 
favorite disciple. He attained 
enlightenment after the demise of the 
Buddha under the guidance of Mahakasyapa
. He was famed for his excellent memory 
and recited the Sutra-Pitaka (the 
sermons contained in the Tripitaka, q.v.
) at the First Buddhist Council." 
"Ananda was more than any other an 
advocate for the cause of women. He gave
 Dharma discourses in the presence of 
<pb n="322"/>
women, and it was at his intercession 
that Buddha consented to the founding of
 an order of nuns. He is said to have 
attained Arhatship only after the death 
of the Buddha, immediately before the 
First Council." (See Buddhist Councils 
for details). 
NOTE: 
According to Mahayana teachings, Ananda,
 like many other disciples of the Buddha
 was in reality a Bodhisattva who 
expediently took the form of a monk to 
assist Sakyamuni Buddha ... Thus, at one
 time he "defended" the cause of women 
at another time he was "lured" by a 
beautiful prostitute (See the Surangama 
Sutra for example).

<_-xa>Sudatta，須達多</_-xa>
<_-xa>Jeta Grove，祗樹林</_-xa>; <_-xa>Golden 
Colored King，金色國王</_-xa>

"Another name for Sudatta who lived at 
Sravasti, India, during the time of 
Sakyamuni Buddha. He was wealthy and 
often donated food and clothing to 
orphans and old people. Hence he was 
<pb n="323"/>
called Anathapindika or 'one who takes 
care of widows and orphans.' He 
presented Sakyamuni with the Jetavana-
vihara (Jeta grove or garden)." 
"The chief supporter of the Buddha was 
Anathapindika, the millionaire. Amongst 
lay followers he was regarded as the 
foremost alms-giver. The original name 
of Anathapindika, which means 'Feeder of
 the Helpless', was Sudatta. Owing to 
his unparalleled generosity he was 
latterly known by his new name. His 
birthplace was Savatthi (Sravasti). 
Anathapindika bought the park belonging 
to Prince Jeta at a price determined by 
covering, so the story goes, the whole 
site with gold coins and erected the 
famous Jetavana Monastery at a great 
cost. Here the Buddha spent nineteen 
rainy seasons. This monastery where the 
Buddha spent the major part of his life 
was the place where he delivered many of
 his sermons. (Narada Maha Thera, The 
Buddha and His Teachings)." 
"Sudatta's wife and children also became
 disciples of the Buddha. Ananda and 
Sariputra visited Sudatta when he fell 
ill, and he is said to have been reborn 
in the Tusita Heaven after his death." 
NOTE: The name Anathapindika has come to
<pb n="324"/>
 be synonymous with extreme generosity 
in connection with Buddhist activities. 
However, this is not his only claim to 
fame. An interesting story about 
Anathapindika goes like this: at the 
time of the Buddha, the role of lay 
people was merely to provide material 
support to monks and nuns. It was not 
the practice to teach them the higher 
truths, which were reserved for those 
who had joined the Order. At 
Anathapindika's deathbed however, the 
Elder Sariputra made an exception and 
conveyed to him the Buddha's teaching on
 Wisdom. Anathapindika was moved to 
tears and requested that henceforth, 
such teachings be shared with lay people
 also, as some of them could benefit 
from these ideas. It was as a result of 
this plea that lay people may now be 
exposed to the higher teachings of the 
Buddha.

Cause and Effect，因果</_-xa>; <_-xa>Herbs (

A major affliction, one of the three 
poisons in Buddhism.
Buddhism of Wisdom ＆ Faith/ excerpts:
"Among the various afflictions, only 
anger manifests itself in a crude manner
, destroying the practitioner in a most 
effective way. Therefore the ancients 
said: 'When we allow an angry thought to
 arise, we open the door to millions of 
obstructions.' For example, while 
reciting the Buddha's name, a 
practitioner may suddenly think of a 
wicked, ungrateful, stern and evil 
person who has treated him cruelly; or, 
he may remember close relatives who are 
troublesome and unreliable and have 
caused him grief. He therefore becomes 
sad and angry, fidgety and uneasy. In 
that state of mind, his mouth recites 
the Buddha's name while his mind is 
saddened and full of delusive thoughts. 
Some practitioners drop their rosaries 
and stop reciting; lying down, they put 
their arms on their foreheads and let 
their minds wander aimlessly. Others are
 so afflicted and saddened that they 
<pb n="327"/>
forget about eating and sleeping in 
their desire to confront the culprit and
 shout at him; or they look for ways to 
take revenge and get even. The angry 
mind can harm the practitioner to that 
extent. To combat and subdue anger and 
resentment, we must develop a 
compassionate mind. The Lotus Sutra 
teaches: 'We should take the mind of 
great compassion as our house, 
forbearance as our armor, the Truth of 
Emptiness as our throne.' We should 
think: we ourselves and all other 
sentient beings are common mortals 
drowning in the sea of Birth and Death, 
all because of karma and afflictions. 
However, afflictions by their very 
nature are illusory and unreal. For 
example, where does an angry thought 
come from before it arises? Where does 
it return to when it dissipates? When we
 are angry and resentful, we are the 
first to suffer, because we have ignited
 the fire of afflictions, which will 
consume us. Anger, moreover, can neither
 convert nor bring a single benefit to 
anyone. Is it not then a useless case of
 delusion? We should think further: 
those who have harmed us by their 
wrongful actions have, through delusion,
<pb n="328"/>
 planted evil seeds; they will 
necessarily suffer retribution. They 
should therefore be the objects of pity,
 not anger. This is because, if they 
were clear-minded and understood the 
causes of merit and retribution, they 
would never dare do such things. We are 
offspring of the Buddhas and should 
apply their teachings to dissolve our 
own afflictions -- because the goal of 
cultivation is to seek liberation and 
happiness, not to descend upon the path 
of suffering. We should feel 
compassionate and forgiving of injurious
 actions and practice forbearance, 
understanding that everything is 
illusory and void. We should remember 
the words of the ancient masters: 'The 
fire of the three poisons, greed, anger 
and delusion,/ Burns up all the forests 
of virtue/. Those who would tread the 
Bodhisattva Path,/ Should be forbearing 
in mind and body.'" 
"Coming at the conclusion of the section
 devoted to the protection of Bodhicitta
 (Bodhi-Mind), patience is celebrated as
 the supreme austerity. It is the 
antidote to anger, regarded in Buddhism 
as the most destructive and perilous of 
all mental factors. Anger, defined as 
<pb n="329"/>
the flooding of the mind with violent 
and aggressive feelings, leading 
naturally to hostility and conflict, is 
outlawed in Buddhism as in no other 
religious tradition. Even so-called 
righteous anger, so often excused as 
having injustice and abuse as its object
, is utterly condemned if this involves 
the overpowering of the mind in a wave 
of uncontrollable and destructive 
passion. Aside from a purely external 
and as it were artificial indignation, 
put on for educational purposes--which 
has compassion as its motive and is 
acted out by one whose mind is under 
control--anger has absolutely no place 
in the scheme of spiritual development. 
It is totally inimical to mental 
training and will ruin and annihilate in
 an instant all progress and merit 
gained. This being so, the crucial 
question of how to behave in a hostile 
environment begins to emerge. Step by 
step, patriarch Shantideva (q.v.) 
focuses on the real source of the 
problem, the basis of anger as of every 
other defilement. This is the ego, the 
self, the sense of 'I,' experienced as 
the center of the universe, and a 
universe interpreted as friend and enemy
<pb n="330"/>
 in relation to how it is perceived from
 the egocentric viewpoint. In Buddhism, 
this is of course the central issue, and
 it is only in the light of the full 
teachings on emptiness that it can be 
satisfactorily discussed." 
NOTE: As a practical application, if 
family members constantly "dangle the 
word Death before their eyes," realizing
 that it can strike at any time, there 
will be less friction, less anger, more 
tolerance of others' shortcomings -- 
more compassion. 



<xa>ANGKOR</xa>
<_-xa>Cambodia (Buddhism)，柬埔寨佛教</_-xa>

"Temple complex in central Cambodia, 
considered the high point of classical 
Khmer art and architecture. Built under 
King Suryavarman II ( 1113-50), Angkor 
Wat was initially a holy site 
consecrated to Vishnu. Following the 
conversion of the succeeding Khmer kings
 to Buddhism, Angkor Wat served as a 
Buddhist holy place. After the 
destruction of Angkor by the Thais and 
the flight of the Khmer kings to Phnom 
<pb n="331"/>
Penh in the fifteenth century, Angkor 
Wat fell into oblivion and was covered 
by jungle. It was not rediscovered until
 the nineteenth century." 



<xa>ANGULIMALA，央掘摩羅</xa>
<_-xa>Paritta，護身咒</_-xa>

"According to the Anguliimala Sutra, 
Angulimala originally studied under a 
teacher of Brahmanism in Shravasti. When
 he spurned the advances of his teacher'
s young and beautiful wife, she 
slandered Angulimala to her husband. 
Enraged, the teacher resolved to destroy
 the young man without dirtying his own 
hands. He told Angulimala that if he 
killed a hundred people (some sources 
say one thousand) and cut off their 
fingers, he could complete his religious
 practice. Torn between his own moral 
sense and belief in his duty to obey his
 teacher, Angulimala went mad. He had 
already killed ninety-nine people and 
was about to kill his mother for the 
hundredth, when he met the Buddha who 
instructed him and converted him to 
Buddhism." 
<pb n="332"/>
"The life story of the Venerable 
Angulimala is one of the most moving 
accounts in the Buddhist canon. After 
killing ninety-nine persons, Angulimala 
was converted by the Buddha, repented 
his evil ways and joined the Order: One 
day as he went on his round for alms he 
saw a woman in labor. Moved by 
compassion, he reported this pathetic 
woman's suffering to the Buddha who then
 advised him to pronounce the following 
words of truth, which later became known
 as the Angulimala Paritta (Mantra) . '
Sister, since my birth in the Arya clan 
(i.e., since my ordination), I know not 
that I consciously destroyed the life of
 any living being. By this truth may you
 be whole and may your child be whole.' 
He went to the presence of the suffering
 sister and uttered these words. 
Instantly, she delivered the child with 
ease." (Narada Maha Thera, The Buddha 
and His Teaching, p.124.)" 



<xa>ANIMAL，畜生</xa>
<_-xa>Evil Paths，惡道</_-xa>; <_-xa>Animal 
Slaughter，殺動物</_-xa>

<pb n="333"/>
"One of the six forms of rebirth and one
 of the three Evil Paths is rebirth as 
an animal in the human world. Beings who
 are reborn as animals suffer at the 
hands of hunters, trappers, and butchers
, and by being forced to work as beasts 
of burden for farmers and merchants." 



<xa>ANIMAL</xa>
<_-xa>Vegetarianism，吃素</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Killing殺</_-xa>; <_-xa>Abortion，墮胎</_-xa>

Note the following stanza from an 
ancient Buddhist poem, linking animal 
slaughter to bad karma, particularly 
insurrection and warfare:
"For hundreds of thousands of years,/ 
the stew in the pot/ has brewed hatred 
and resentment/ that is difficult to 
stop./ If you wish to know why there are
 disasters/ of armies and weapons in the
 world,/ listen to the piteous cries/ 
from the slaughterhouses at midnight." 
In Mahayana Buddhism, violence and 
warfare can never be ended as long as 
animal slaughter and other forms of 
violence (castration, forced feeding, 
etc.) against the animal realm continue 
<pb n="334"/>
unabated. To seek world peace while 
continuing the slaughtering of animals 
for food is no different from trying to 
cool a boiling pot by fanning the top, 
all the while keeping the flame going 
underneath. 
NOTE: 
See also the following excerpt about Dr.
 Temple Grandin, a cattle expert who 
devoted her life to designing humane 
slaughtering systems that would at least
 drastically reduce pain and fears for 
the animals: "When a... humane system 
was installed in Alabama a few years ago
, Dr. Grandin operated the hydrautic 
gears of the restraining box (where the 
animal was going to be killed) herself (
as a test run), concentrating on easing 
the animal into the box as gently as 
possible. 'When I held his head in the 
yoke, I imagined placing my hands on his
 forehead and under his chin and gently 
easing him into position,' she wrote in 
her book. 'Body boundaries seemed to 
disappear, and I had no awareness of 
pushing the levers.' She compared it to 
a state of Zen meditation: 'The more 
gently I was able to hold the animal 
with the apparatus, the more peaceful I 
felt. As the life force left the animal,
<pb n="335"/>
 I had deep religious feelings. For the 
first time in my life logic had been 
completely overwhelmed by feelings I did
 not know I had.' A slaughterhouse 
certainly 'makes you look at your own 
mortality,' said Dr. Grandin. 'Those 
animals just walk into the chute and it'
s all over. If you see them cut up, they
're so fragile inside. People are made 
of the same stuff.'" NY Times: Aug 5 '97
 



<xa>ANTHOLOGIES，結集</xa>
<_-xa>Tripitaka，三藏</_-xa>

"Buddhism seems always to have suffered 
a surfeit of sutras. Even in the 
centuries when the teachings were 
maintained only in memory, it appears 
that no one monk was expected to 
remember everything: we find reference 
to 'reciters of the middle-length 
discourses.' With the explosion of 
Mahayana sutra writing about four 
centuries after the Buddha's death, the 
problem of a surplus of sutras was 
greatly compounded. A remedy was 
attempted in the form of the anthology. 
<pb n="336"/>
The first of these is attributed to the 
Indian master, Nagarjuna (second-century
 C.E.). Entitled Compendium of Sutras, 
it consist of passages from sixty-eight,
 mostly Mahayana, sutras. The history of
 anthologies in the West began in 1871 
when Samuel Beal, who described himself 
as 'a Chaplain in Her Majesty's Fleet', 
published A Catena of Buddhist 
Scriptures from the Chinese. This book 
included a wide variety of Buddhist 
texts -- for the most part Indian works 
-- that had been translated into Chinese
 ... The first major attempt at 
anthologizing occurred as part of the 
Sacred Books of the East series, 
published in 1894. Ten of the forty-nine
 volumes of the series were devoted to 
Buddhism. Reflecting the opinion of the 
day that Pali texts represented the most
 accurate record of what the Buddha 
taught (an opinion since rejected), 
seven of these volumes contain 
translations of Pali works. In 1895, 
Paul Carus (q.v.) published The Gospel 
of Buddha According to Old Records. The 
work was arranged like the Bible, with 
numbered chapters and verses, and was 
intended to point up the many agreements
 between Buddhism and Christianity, 
<pb n="337"/>
thereby bringing out 'that nobler 
Christianity which aspires to be the 
cosmic religion of universal truth.' 
Carus drew from the Buddhist sources 
that were available to him in English, 
French, and German. He was free in his 
manipulation of his sources, 
paraphrasing, abbreviating, and 
rearranging the translations ... One 
year later, the Harvard Pali scholar 
Henry Clarke Warren published what was 
to be one of the most widely read 
anthologies of Buddhist texts, Buddhism 
in Translations. Drawn entirely from 
Pali sourcos, it contained a much wider 
range of materials than had been 
available. These works provided much of 
the material for future anthologies, 
which were often made up entirely of 
extracts (often no more than snippets), 
with the bulk of the materials drawn 
from the Pali.
There were, however, some important 
exceptions. Dwight Goddard's popular 
1938 collection, A Buddhist Bible, was 
organized by language of origin and 
contained works that had not previously 
been translated into English. Going 
against the trend to excerpt 'key' 
passages, Goddard included full 
<pb n="338"/>
translations of these texts. A Buddhist 
Bible is not, however, without its 
eccentricities. Goddard rearranged the 
Diamond Sutra into a more 'sensible' 
order, including the Tao Te Ching ... 
Another exception to the 'recycling' 
trend was Edward Conze's Buddhist Texts 
through the Ages ( 1954), which brought 
together some of the leading scholars of
 the day to translate works never before
 rendered into English, including 
tantric texts. More recently, Stephan 
Beyer's The Buddhist Experience: Sources
 and Interpretations (1974) includes a 
rich range of works from Pali, Sanskrit,
 Tibetan, Chinese, and Japanese, all 
translated by Beyer. It has been 
replaced in the same series by John 
Strong's excellent new anthology, The 
Experience of Buddhism: Sources and 
Interpretations (1995). This long and 
venerable tradition loomed before me as 
I set out to make a new anthology... 
entitled Buddhism in Practice". (Donald 
S. Lopez, Jr./ 1996)

<xa>ARHAT，阿羅漢</xa>
<_-xa>Arhatship (Four Stages)，阿羅漢果（四種果位）</_-xa>; <_-xa>Buddhist Councils，結集</_-xa>; 
<_-xa>Sravaka，聲聞</_-xa>; <_-xa>Bodhisattva，
菩薩</_-xa>

"A Buddhist saint; one who has attained 
enlightenment and is no longer subject 
to death and rebirth." 
Arhatship is the highest rank attained 
by Sravakas (senior disciples of the 
Buddha). An Arhat is a Buddhist saint 
who has attained liberation from the 
cycle of Birth and Death, generally 
through living a monastic life in 
accordance with the Buddha's teachings. 
This is the goal of Theravadin practice,
 as contrasted with Bodhisattvahood in 
Mahayana practice.

"One of the ten appellations of the 
Buddha. In early Buddhism, the Buddha 
was called Arhat, but after the rise of 
Mahayana, the word Arhat was limited to 
the saints of Theravada Buddhism." 
"In the passage of Buddhism to China, 
<pb n="341"/>
the conception of the Arhat underwent a 
particular development and became one of
 the most important elements in Chinese 
Buddhism, even of the Mahayana schools. 
The prime vehicle for the veneration of 
Arhats was the Ch'an (Zen) school. 
Because of its emphasis on the human 
side of things and its aversion to any 
worship of deities, it saw in these 
saints, who had attained liberation 
through their own effort, beings 
corresponding to the mind of Ch'an (Zen)
. Magical abilities were attributed to 
the Arhats as the fruit of their wisdom.
 In East Asian monasteries, groups of 
500 Lohan (Arhat) images are found, 
arranged in special halls, and also 
groups, originally of sixteen, later 
mostly of eighteen, located left and 
right on the short walls of the halls of
 the monasteries. Each individual Arhat 
has unique features that are 
characteristic of him and that are 
highly expressive. The depictions of 500
 Lohans derives from the canonical 
descriptions of the first Buddhist 
Council, at which 500 Arhats were 
present. Also the council of Kashmir is 
said to have been attended by 500 Arhats
." (See also: Buddhist Councils). 
<pb n="342"/>
"Evidence of the contrast between the 
Bodhisattva and the Arhat is plentiful 
in the Mahayana scriptures, but for a 
really vivid impression you have only to
 look at the Buddhist paintings and 
sculptures produced in India and China, 
and now preserved in temples and museums
 throughout the World. The Bodhisattva 
is usually depicted as a beautiful young
 man (or woman) sitting on a delicate 
lotus flower. He has a graceful figure, 
long flowing locks, and many fine 
ornaments. The Arhat, on the other hand,
 is usually an old man with a bald head 
and bushy eyebrows. Clad in a shabby 
monastic robe, he leans wearily on a 
knotted staff. No lotus seat for him--he
 is usually standing on solid rock, or 
sometimes, for a change, floating on the
 ocean. The Bodhisattva represents the 
ideal in all its perfection and purity, 
the abstract ideal not stained or 
touched by anything of the world, but 
lifted above it. The Arhat, by contrast,
 represents the realization of the ideal
 under the conditions and limitations of
 space and time, the stress of history. 
No wonder the Arhat has a weather-beaten
, worn look."

Refers to four levels of Enlightenment, 
culminating in Arhatship. Arhats are no 
longer subject to rebirth in Samsara, i.
e., in the cycle of Birth and Death. 
"These are the four stages of 
enlightenment on the Theravada path, 
namely, the stage of Stream-enterer (
Srotapanna), the Once-returner, the Non-
returner (Anagamin), and the Arhat." 



<xa>ARISING，生/生起</xa>
"This word appears frequently in 
Mahayana texts, often in the negative 
form. It denotes the appearance, 
production, or coming into being of a 
thing or event. According to the 
emptiness (sunyata) view, that which 
arises from dependent generation is by 
nature empty; hence all arising things 
are illusory (maya)."

became Principal of Deccan College in 
Poona, India. He published his first 
book of verse in 1853, translated texts 
from Sanskrit, and even compiled a 
Turkish grammar in 1877. The Light of 
Asia became immediately popular upon 
publication in 1879. The book inspired 
many other authors, and was seen as an 
antidote to a number of mid-century 
writers and scholars (such as Eugene 
Burnouf, Barthelemy Saint-Hilaire, and 
others) who saw Buddhism as a wholly 
nihilistic religion. Although he never 
publicly avowed a personal commitment to
 the Buddhist religion, many observers 
felt that Arnold was a Buddhist at heart

"Much of the art of Buddhist countries 
has been directly inspired by Buddhist 
ideas and practices, although very 
little has been the work of Buddhist 
monks. The production of works of art 
has been primarily done by Buddhist

architecture are the major fields; music
 is not encouraged in Buddhist 
devotional contexts and is not used by 
monks, whose corporate chanting of 
sutras in devotional services bears some
 slight similarity to European plain-
chant but is basically a reciting aloud.
In the field of sculpture, however, 
Buddhism has a rich record, particularly
 in the development of the rupa, or 
Buddha-statue, from early beginnings in 
N.W. India to its modern forms in S.E. 
Asian countries (Taiwan, Thailand, 
Vietnam, etc...). The painting of murals
 on walls of monasteries and temples has
 also had a long development and has

produced many different styles; the 
principal subjects have been, and still

<xa>ASTROLOGY，占星術</xa>
<_-xa>Fortune Telling，算命</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Spirit World</_-xa>

<pb n="351"/>
"The question many people ask is whether
 Buddhism accepts or rejects astrology. 
Strictly speaking, the Buddha did not 
make any direct pronouncement on this 
subject, because as in many other cases,
 He stated that discussion on matters 
such as these do not pertain to 
spiritual development. Buddhism, unlike 
some other religions, does not condemn 
astrology and people are free to use the
 knowledge they can get from it to make 
their lives more meaningful. If we study
 the Buddha's teaching carefully, we 
will come to accept that a proper and 
intelligent understanding of astrology 
can be a useful tool. There is a direct 
link between the life of an individual 
human being and the vast workings of the
 cosmos. Modern science is in accordance
 with the teachings of Buddhism.
We know for example that there is a 
close link between the movement of the 
moon and our own behaviour. This is seen
 especially among mentally disturbed and
 abnormally violent people. It is also 
true that certain sicknesses like asthma
 and bronchitis are aggravated when the 
moon waxes. There is, therefore, 
sufficient basis for us to believe that 
other 'planets' can also influence our 
<pb n="352"/>
lives. Buddhism accepts that there is an
 immense cosmic energy which pulsates 
through every living thing, including 
plants. This energy interacts with the 
karmic energy which an individual 
generates and determines the course that
 a life will take. The birth of an 
individual is not the first creation of 
a life but the continuation of one that 
had always existed and will continue to 
exist so long as the karmic energy is 
not quelled through final liberation in 
the unconditioned state. Now, for a life
 to manifest itself in a new existence, 
certain factors, namely seasons, 
germinal order and nature, must be 
fulfilled. These are supported by mental
 energy and karmic energy and all these 
elements are in constant interaction and
 are interdependent with each other, 
resulting in constant changes to a human
 being's life. According to astrologers,
 the time at which a person is born is 
predetermined by cosmic energy and 
karmic energy. Hence, it can be 
concluded that life is not merely 
accidental: it is the result of the 
interaction between an individual's 
karma and the universal energy force. 
The course of a human life is 
<pb n="353"/>
predetermined, caused partly by a being'
s own actions in the past and by the 
energies that activate the cosmos. Once 
started, a life is controlled by the 
interaction between these two forces 
even to the moment at which a birth 
takes place. A skillful astrologer then,
 as one who understands cosmic as well 
as karmic influence, can chart the 
course of one's life, based on the 
moment of a person's birth. While we are
 in one sense at the mercy of these 
forces, the Buddha has pointed out a way
 through which we can escape their 
influence. All karmic energies are 
stored in the subconscious mind normally
 described as mental purities and 
impurities. Since karmic forces 
influence one's destiny, a person can 
develop his mind and negate certain evil
 influences caused by previous bad karma
. A person can also 'purify' his mind 
and rid himself of all karmic energies 
and thus prevent rebirth. When there is 
no rebirth, there is no potential life 
and there will consequently be no '
future' existence which can be 
predicated or charted. At such a stage 
of spiritual and mental development, one
 will have transcended the need to know 
<pb n="354"/>
about his life because most 
imperfections and unsatisfactoriness 
would have been removed. A highly 
developed human being will have no need 
for a horoscope." 



<xa>ASURA，阿修羅</xa>
"Originally in Brahmanism and Hinduism a

<xa>ATMAN，阿特曼</xa>
<_-xa>Anatman，無我</_-xa>

Sanskrit for "soul". In Pali,"atta". "
When a man clung to his ego, or soul, (
atman in Sanskrit), and its enjoyment of
 worldly pleasures, the Buddha revealed 
the non-existence of ego (anatman) to 
wipe out his conception of ego. 
Unfortunately, adherents of the Southern
<pb n="358"/>
 School grasp this word anatman in their
 argument to silence those clinging to 
ego (atman) and interminable discussions
 have been going on in the West since 
the introduction there of the term 
anatman. If we examine both words 
closely, we come to the conclusion that 
atman means the 'existing ego' and 
anatman, the 'non-existent ego'; in 
other words the two extremes 'is' and '
is not' of a dualism which has no 
independent nature of its own. For this 
reason, in His Mahayana teaching, the 
Buddha taught His disciples to release 
their hold of not only 'is' but of 'is 
not', that is of both atman and anatman,
 in order not to be held in bondage by 
either of them. He said in the Diamond 
Sutra: 'Even the Dharma should be cast 
aside, how much more so the NotDharma?' 
Thus we come to this: (1) The worldly 
man grasps atman, or ego, or soul, (2) 
The Southern School man grasps anatman, 
or non-existent ego, and (3) The 
Mahayana man grasps neither atman nor 
anatman."(Charles Luk, Ch'an and Zen 
Teaching, p.10.) 



<pb n="359"/>
<xa>ATONEMENT，贖罪</xa>
<_-xa>Dedication of Merit回向</_-xa>

"Early Buddhism (i.e. Theravada) does 
not stress vicarious atonement; each 
person must work out his own salvation. 
We may help each other by thought, word 
and deed, but cannot bear another's 
results or take over consequences of 
another's errors or misdeeds. In 
Mahayana the stress on compassion has 
produced the doctrine of Bodhisattvas, 
who help humanity by renouncing benefit 
of their accumulated store of 'merit', 
and 'handing it over' to offset the bad 
karma of humanity. This has further 
developed into salvation by grace of 
Amitabha by calling on his name (thereby
 developing Concentration and Wisdom)." 
NOTE:
Salvation by grace alone principally 
exists in the Jodo-Shinshu (or Shin) 
school of Japanese Pure Land. All other 
Pure Land denominations in East Asia (
including the Jodo or Pure Land school

help and grace, the self-help aspect

<xa>ATTACHMENT，執著</xa>
<_-xa>Grasping，執著</_-xa>; <_-xa>Clinging，執著
</_-xa>
<_-xa>Self，我</_-xa>; <_-xa>Love-attachment，
愛著</_-xa>

"Attachment, grasping (upadana) or, as 
sometimes translated, 'clinging', is 
according to Buddhist thought an 
intensified form of craving. It is of 4 
kinds: (1) sensuous-clinging, i.e., 
clinging to sensuous desires and 
pleasures (2) clinging to views (false 
or mistaken) (3) clinging to rules and 
rituals, with the idea that one may 
through them gain salvation (4) clinging
 to the notion of individual personality
. The Anagamin is regarded as entirely 
free from all these manifestations of 
grasping or clinging."

"In the Four Noble Truths, Buddha 
Shakyamuni taught that attachment to 
self is the root cause of suffering: '
From craving (attachment) springs grief,
<pb n="361"/>
/ From craving springs fear;/ For him 
who is wholly free from craving,/ There 
is no grief, much less fear.'" (
Dhammapada Sutra) 

Specifically for monks and nuns, 
Buddhist cultivation entails ridding 
themselves ultimately of all attachments
, beginning with attachment to their own
 body and mind (Mark of Self). Once this
 is achieved, they will be able to 
transcend attachment to family and 
friends (Mark of Others), attachment to 
sentient beings other than family and 
friends (Mark of Sentient Beings) and 
finally, attachment to the duration of 
their life (Mark of Lifespan). The more 
successful their cultivation is, the 
more detachment they achieve, the calmer
 their mind becomes and the closer they 
are to the Way (i.e. salvation). 
For the seasoned practitioner, even the 
Dharma (teachings of the Buddha) must 
not become an attachment. As an analogy,
 to clean one's shirt, it is necessary 
to use soap. However, if the soap is not
 then rinsed out, the garment will not 
be truly clean. Similarly, the 
practitioner's mind will not be fully 
liberated until he severs attachment to 
<pb n="362"/>
everything, including the Dharma itself.

Pure Land Buddhism
"Question: I venture to think that the 
True Mind has always been equal, clear 
and even. If there is still revulsion 
for the Saha World and fondness for the 
Pure Land, then there is still love and 
hate, grasping (attachment) and 
rejection. Are we not still in error? 
Answer: 'You raise this question because
 you still do not understand the issue 
in depth. This revulsion and fondness is
 not the mundane mind of love and hate, 
but is rather the common method employed
 by all the Buddhas of the Ten 
Directions, to transform ordinary beings
 into sages. If there is no revulsion 
and rejection, how can common mortals be
 transformed? If there is no fondness 
and grasping, how can sagehood be 
attained? Therefore, in the span of 
cultivation from ordinary person to 
sagehood and from sagehood to Equal 
Enlightenment, everything is within the 
cycle of grasping and rejection, 
revulsion and fondness. Only when the 
practitioner has attained the highest 
level of Wonderful Enlightenment (the 
stage immediately before Buddhahood) 
<pb n="363"/>
will he be free of such feelings and 
enter the state of Equal Thusness (
Buddhahood). For this reason, the 
ancients have said: At the beginning, 
cultivators should have feelings of 
grasping and rejection, in order to 
arrive at the point of no grasping and 
no rejection. When that grasping and 
rejection have reached the ultimate 
stage, they will be found to be the same
 as non-grasping and non-rejection. 
Moreover, the Pure Land method was 
taught by Buddha Sakyamuni and Buddha 
Amitabha, with Buddha Sakyamuni 
exhorting people to seek rebirth and 
Buddha Amitabha playing the role of 
welcoming and escorting. If the Pure 
Land cultivator does not have feelings 
of revulsion and rejection, how can he 
leave the Saha World? If he does not 
have feelings of fondness and seeking, 
how can he be reborn in the Western Pure
 Land? To achieve rebirth is nothing 
more than to rely on the auspicious 
environment of that Land to achieve 
Buddhahood swiftly. Therefore, such 
grasping and rejection, revulsion and 
fondness are of great benefit; how can 
they possibly be considered liabilities?
"' P.L. DIA: 76
<pb n="364"/>
"As stated in the Pure Land classic 
Direct Pointing to the Source (Kuei Yuan
 Chih Chih/Qui-Nguyen Truc-Chi): 'If 
your illness becomes serious, and you 
are facing the end, your relatives 
should not weep or wail or utter sounds 
of lamentation and distress. This may 
throw your mind into confusion and make 
you lose correct mindfulness. They 
should just join together and recite the
 Buddha-name to help you go to the Pure 
Land. Only after your breathing has 
stopped for a long time can they weep 
and wail. As soon as there is the least 
bit of longing for the world, it 
immediately becomes an obstruction, and 
you will not achieve liberation. If you 
find people who clearly understand the 
Pure Land (i.e. good spiritual advisors)
, let them come frequently to urge you 
on and encourage you. This would be a 
great good fortune"' (J.C. Cleary, Pure 
Land, Pure Mind). NOTE: 
Love-attachment is, along with killing, 
one of the two major impediments to 
rebirth in the Pure Land.

swift and easy as a boat sailing 
downstream in the direction of the 
blowing wind. This observation is very 
appropriate indeed. Moreover, once 
reborn there, living in an auspicious 
and peaceful environment, always in the 
company of Buddha Amitabha and the 
Bodhisattvas, the practitioner will 
swiftly achieve success in whatever 
Dharma method he chooses. He is like a 
log rolling down a high mountain, which 
just keeps going and never stops, even 
for a moment."

The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara (Chin/
<pb n="367"/>
Kuan Yin, Vn/Quan-Am) is one of the 
Three Pure Land Sages, the others being 
Buddha Amitabha and the Bodhisattva 
Mahasthamaprapta (q.v.). Amitabha Buddha
 is frequently depicted standing between
 Avalokitesvara and Mahasthamaprapta (Ta
 Shih Chih). The Meditation Sutra 
teaches, inter alia, visualization of 
their features. In some texts, these two
 Bodhisattvas are referred to in the 
masculine form. However, feminine forms 
are commonly used to reflect popular 
East Asian imagery. 
Also called Kuan Yin, the Bodhisattva of
 Compassion. Usually recognizable by the
 small Buddha adorning Her crown or 
headdress.

"Known as the 'Goddess of Mercy' in 
China and as 'she who hears the cries of
 the world'. A Bodhisattva linked with 
the compassion aspect of mind. Attained 
enlightenment by means of the faculty of
 hearing. The name means 'sound regarder
'. Kuan-yin's bodhimandala is at Pu-to."

"Chenrezi is the Tibetan form of 
Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of 
compassion. She is considered as the 
patron and protector of the 'Land of 
<pb n="368"/>
Snow'. Important events and 
personalities of Tibetan Buddhism are 
regarded as connected with Chenrezi's 
action."

"In the Buddhism of faith, Kuan-Yin is a
 refuge and protector, who 'suffers 
vicariously in the hells out of great 
compassion.' Reflectively, however, Kuan
-Yin exemplifies the compassion of one 
who knows that, 'in some way, all 
suffering is his own suffering, and all 
sentient beings the disguises of his own
 inmost nature.' 'A skylark wounded in 
the wing, a churub does cease to sing.' 
The Bodhisattva is sick because his 
fellow-being is sick. (C.N. Tay, Kuan 
Yin: The Cult of Half Asia.)"
"The 'Avalokitesvara (twenty-fifth) 
Chapter' of the Lotus Sutra states: If .
.. living beings much given to carnal 
passion keep in mind and revere the 
Bodhisattva 'Regarder of the Cries of 
the World', they will be set free from 
their passion. If those much given to 
irascibility (hatred and anger) keep in 
mind and revere the Bodhisattva '
Regarder of the Cries of the World,' 
they will be set free from their 
irascibility. If those much given to 
<pb n="369"/>
delusion keep in mind and revere the 
Bodhisattva 'Regarder of the Cries of 
the World,' they will be set free from 
their delusion." 
The same is true of reciting the Buddha'
s name. However, you should concentrate 
your mind to the utmost and put a stop 
to 'sundry (distracting) thoughts ', 
doubts and uncertainties. Whatever you 
seek will then materialize. As the 
Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara has great 
affinities with sentient beings in the 
Saha World, you should, in addition to 
your regular Pure Land sessions, recite 
Her name.
Alternatively, you may also recite the 
Surangama Mantra or the Great Compassion
 Mantra" (Patriarch Yin Kuang). 
I. ILLUSTRATIVE STORY
"During the years 363-366 there 
flourished the monk Zhu Fayi, who 
dwelled in the mountains and was fond of
 study. He lived in the Bao Mountains in
 Shining (probably in today's Yunnan 
Province). In his travels he learned 
many scriptures and especially excelled 
in the Lotus Sutra, and he attracted 
many disciples -- most of the time more 
than a hundred studied under him. In 372
 he suddenly felt an illness localized 
<pb n="370"/>
in the region of his heart. For a long 
time he tried various preparations and 
techniques, but none cured him. After 
many attempts he gave up trying to heal 
himself and devoted himself exclusively 
to taking sincere refuge in Guan-yin (
Avalokiteshvara). After several days of 
devotional acts he fell asleep and saw, 
in a dream, a monk who came to attend 
him in his illness. To cure him, this 
monk cut him open, extracted his stomach
 and intestines, and washed them. He saw
 that there had been many impure objects
 inside him. After thoroughly cleansing 
them, the monk replaced the organs and 
told Fayi: 'Your sickness is now 
expelled.' When Fayi woke up, all his 
symptoms were gone, and he soon felt 
like his old self again. It is said in 
the (Lotus) Sutra that sometimes he (
Guanyin) appears in the form of a monk 
or brahmacarin (Buddhist ascetic). 
Perhaps Fayi's dream was an instance of 
this." 
II. NOTE:
"Next to Amitabha, the most popular 
deity of the Pure Land school of 
Mahayana Buddhism throughout East Asia..
. Numerous legends and stories have 
arisen in China regarding her origin,

her honour are to be found all over 
China and elsewhere in Asia."

Chin/ Hua-yen; Jpn/ Kegon; Vn/ Hoa 
Nghiem.
"Important school of Mahayana Buddhism 
in which the highly metaphysical 
doctrines represent the highest 
development of Mahayana Buddhist thought
. The school based its principal 
teachings on the Hua-yen Ching or the 
Avatamsaka Sutra (The Flower Ornament 
Sutra or The Flower Adornment Sutra ). 
This was accepted as the first discourse
 of Buddha on his enlightenment, 
preached to Bodhisattvas, and is beyond 
the comprehension of mortals, to whom he
 proceeded to preach a simpler doctrine.
 Tu-shun (557-640) is reputed to be its 
first Chinese master, followed by Chih-
yen (601-68) and Fa-tsang (643-712). Fa-
tsang, who had been a disciple of Hsuan 
Tsang, was the greatest exponent of Hua 
Yen philosophy." 
"The Avatamsaka school distinguishes 
itself from the other Mahayana schools 
in an important point. It concentrates 
<pb n="373"/>
on the relationship among phenomena and 
not on that between phenomena and the 
absolute. All things are in complete 
harmony with one another, since they are
 all manifestations of one principle. 
They are like individual waves of the 
same sea. From this point of view 
everything in the world, whether animate
 or inanimate, is an expression of the 
highest principle and is thus one with 
the Buddha-mind." 
"The Avatamsaka school teaches that 
since the true nature of all things is 
non-substantiality from the standpoint 
of the Buddha's enlightenment, all 
phenomena are one with each other and 
interpenetrate without obstruction; one 
permeates all and all are contained in 
one." 
Unlike other Buddhist schools, this 
school is based on a single book, the 
Avatamsaka Sutra. The sutra is an 
encyclopedic work with a single theme: 
enlightenment. Enlightenment is 
presented as the understanding of 
emptiness, through which one comes to 
realize the interpenetration or 
nonobstruction of all things -- the 
characteristic doctrine of the 
Avatamsaka school (A.J. Prince). The 
<pb n="374"/>
Sutra also teaches the doctrine of 
Dependent Origination (see separate 
entry). The teaching is expressed in an 
affirmative way through the figurative 
language and metaphors which abound in 
the Sutra. The best example is the 
metaphor of the 'Brahma Net.' The school
 reached its apogee under Empress Wu (q.
v.) of the Tang dynasty. It declined as 
a major separate school beginning in the
 9th century with its teachings being 
absorbed into Zen, Esoteric and Pure 
Land schools. It is interesting to note 
that chapter 40 (last chapter) of the 
Avatamsaka Sutra, 'The Vows and 
Practices of Samantabhadra '
is considered as the fourth Sutra of the
 Pure Land school.

 Hoa-Nghiem Kinh. The basic text of the 
Avatamsaka school. It is the second 
longest sutra in the Buddhist Canon and 
records the highest teaching of Buddha 
Shakyamuni after Enlightenment. It is 
traditionally believed that the sutra 
was taught to the Bodhisattvas and other
 high spiritual beings while the Buddha 
was in samadhi. The sutra is studied by 
all schools of Mahayana Buddhism, in 
particular, Pure Land and Zen. 
This major sutra is revered by all 
Mahayana schools and has been described 
by Dr. D. T. Suzuki as the "epitome of 
Buddhist thought, Buddhist sentiment and
 Buddhist experience." It was taught by 
Buddha Sakyamuni right after 
Enlightenment (6th century B.C.), under 
the bodhi tree in India to Bodhisattvas 
and other enlightened beings. The Sutra 
was subsequently "lost," only to be 
rediscovered by Nagarjuna in the 3rd 
century A.D. Most of the original 
Sanskrit text is unavailable; however, 
the entire Sutra can be read in Chinese,
 having been translated into that 
language three times between the 5th and
 8th centuries A.D. The versions are 
known as the 40-fascicle, 60-fascicle 
and 80-fascicle, with the 80-fascicle 
<pb n="376"/>
the most popular today (translator: 
Patriarch Sikshananda). There are 
currently at least three translations of
 the Sutra into English. This Sutra is 
also known in English as the Flower 
Ornament Sutra or Flower Garland 
Scripture or by its Chinese (Hua-yen) 
and Japanese (Kegon) names.

I. Background
"Mahayana sutra that constitutes the 
basis of the teachings of the Chinese 
Hua-yen (Jap., Kegon) school, which 
emphasizes above all 'mutually 
unobstructed interpenetration.' In 
addition, it teaches that the human mind
 is the universe itself and is identical
 with the Buddha, indeed, that Buddha, 
Mind, and all sentient beings and things
 are one and the same. This aspect of 
the Mahayana teaching was specially 
stressed by the Chinese Ch'an (Jap., Zen
) school, whence the frequent citations 
of the Avatamsaka Sutra by this school. 
The Avatamsaka Sutra is one of the 
Vaipulya (q.v.) sutras and consists of 
40 chapters, of which the longest is the
 Gandavyuha; another important part is 
the Dashabhumika or 'Ten Stages' chapter
. Only a few chapters of the Sutra are 
<pb n="377"/>
extant in Sanskrit: Chapter 40, vows of 
Samantabha and Chapter 26, Dasliabwnika.
 The oldest Chinese translation is from 
the 5th century. The teachings presented
 here are not spoken by Shakyamuni 
Buddha himself; He is present but 
remains silent most of the time (or just
 approves by praising the text at the 
end, as in the last chapter 'The 
Practices and Vows of the Bodhisattva 
Samantabhadra'). They are rather 
utterances of the Dharmakaya aspect of 
all the Buddhas." 
II. Note:
It is interesting to note that chapter 
40 (last chapter) of the Avatamsaka 
Sutra, 'The Vows and Practices of 
Samantabhadra ' is considered as the 
fourth Sutra of the Pure Land school.

<pb n="378"/>
 who are born in this hell suffer from 
the heat of fire without intermission." 
"The last and deepest of the eight hells
, where sinners suffer, die and are 
instantly reborn to suffer without

"The worst of the hot hells, in which 
suffering, death, and painful rebirth 
are continuous until the retribution for

"It was translated into Chinese in 550 
by Paramartha who had come from India to
 China during the Liang dynasty (502-557
). The treatise sets forth the 
fundamental doctrines of Mahayana 
Buddhism and attempts to awaken people 
to faith in it. In particular, it takes 
up the concept of tathata, meaning 
thusness or suchness, the true aspect of
<pb n="379"/>
 reality. It was widely studied by 
Mahayanists in India, and there are 
several Chinese commentaries." 
"The Awakening of Faith is a commentary 
on Mahayana Buddhism that explains the 
basic notions of the teaching and is 
used, particularly in East Asia, as an 
introduction to the Mahayana. It is one 
of the few sutras that is also of 
importance for Zen." 
NOTE: 
The Treatise on the Awakening of the 
Faith specifically recommends Buddha 
Recitation for all but the most advanced
 practitioners: "Next, suppose there is 
a man who learns this (Mahayana) 
teaching for the first time and wishes 
to seek the correct faith but lacks 
courage and strength. Because he lives 
in this world of suffering, he fears 
that he will not always be able to meet 
the Buddhas and honor them personally, 
and that, faith being difficult to 
perfect, he will be inclined to fall 
back. He should know that the 
Tathagathas have an excellent expedient 
means by which they can protect his 
faith: that is, through the strength of 
wholehearted meditation-recitation on 
the Buddha, he will in fulfillment of 
<pb n="380"/>
his wishes be able to be born in the 
Buddha-land beyond, to see the Buddha 
always, and to be forever separated from
 the evil states of existence. It is as 
the sutra says: 'If a man meditates 
wholly on Amitabha Buddha in the world 
of the Western Paradise and wishes to be
 born in that world, directing all the 
goodness he has cultivated toward that 
goal, then he will be born there.' 
Because he will see the Buddha at all 
times, he will never fall back ... (If a
 cultivator follows this path), he will 
be able to be born there in the end 
because he abides in the correct 
sainadhi.'"

(Y. Hakeda, tr., The Awakening of the 
Faith, p.102.)




<xa>AWAKENING</xa>
<_-xa>Enlightenment，徹悟</_-xa>

Mahayana Buddhism. A clear distinction 
should be made between Awakening/ Great 
Awakening and Supreme Enlightenment. To 
experience a Great Awakening is to 
<pb n="381"/>
achieve (through Zen meditation, Buddha 
Recitation, etc.) "a level of insight 
and understanding equal to that of the 
Buddhas" (Master Yin Kuang). It is to 
see one's Nature, comprehend the True 
Nature of things, the Truth. Only after 
becoming a Buddha can one be said to 
have truly attained Supreme 
Enlightenment (Attained the Way). A 
metaphor appearing in the sutras is that
 of a glass of water containing 
sediments. As long as the glass is 
undisturbed, the sediments remain at the
 bottom and the water is clear. However,
 as soon as the glass is shaken, the 
water becomes turbid. Likewise, when a 
practitioner experiences a Great 
Awakening (Awakens to the Way), his 
afflictions (greed, anger and delusion) 
are temporarily suppressed but not yet 
eliminated. To achieve Supreme 
Enlightenment (i.e., to be rid of all 
afflictions, to discard all sediments) 
is the ultimate goal. Only then can he 
completely trust his mind and actions. 
Before then, he should adhere to the 
precepts, keep a close watch on his mind
 and thoughts, like a cat stalking a 
mouse, ready to pounce on evil thoughts 
as soon as they arise. To do otherwise 
<pb n="382"/>
is to court certain failure, as stories 
upon stories of overconfident monks, 
roshis and gurus demonstrate. 
NOTE: 
The distinction between "Awakening" (
Great Awakening) and "Supreme 
Enlightenment" is very important, 
because only when a cultivator has 
attained Supreme Enlightenment can he 
become a Buddha. There are many degrees 
of Awakening and Enlightenment. The 
Enlightenment of the Arhats, Pratyeka 
Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, etc. is different
 from Supreme Enlightenment, i.e., 
Buddhahood. (In practice however, 
Enlightenment and Supreme Enlightenment 
are sometimes used interchangeably.) 
Likewise, there are many levels of 
Awakenings. The Rinzai (Lin-Chi) school 
of Zen, for example, distinguishes 
between "Small Awakening" and "Great 
Awakening" and teaches that there are an
 infinite number of Small Awakenings 
versus eighteen levels of Great 
Awakenings. Thus, in Zen training, an 
enlightened teacher is absolutely 
necessary. 
On the subject of Awakening, see the 
following excerpts from Buddhism of 
Wisdom and Faith: 
<pb n="383"/>
"Furthermore, in the Dharma-Ending Age (
i.e., current period), how many 
cultivators can claim to be Awakened to 
the Way? Awakening to the Way is not 
easy. There was once a Zen Master who 
practiced with all his might for forty 
years before he succeeded. Another Great
 Master sat for so long that he wore out
 more than a dozen meditation cushions 
before he saw his Original Nature. As 
far as today's Zen practitioners are 
concerned (with the exception of a few 
saints who have taken human form to 
teach sentient beings), the majority 
only manage to achieve a temporary 
calming of the mind and body; at most 
they may witness a few auspicious realms
! Even if they have Awakened to the Way,
 they can still encounter dangerous 
obstacles during transmigration.
... The path of Birth and Death, filled 
with fearful dangers for those who have 
not attained Supreme Enlightenment, is 
the same. Therefore, to claim that we 
should not fear Birth and Death is a 
superficial point of view."

"Monk, male member of the Buddhist 
sangha who has entered homelessness and 
received full ordination. In ancient 
times the bhikshus formed the nucleus of
<pb n="391"/>
 the Buddhist community, since according
 to the early Buddhist view, only a 
person who had renounced the world could
 reach the supreme goal, Nirvana. The 
main activities of bhikshus are 
meditating and presenting the Dharma. 
They are not allowed to work. Buddhist 
monks renounce the amenities of the 
world and lead a life of wandering. The 
basic principles of the monastic life 
are poverty, celibacy, and peaceableness
. The lifestyle is governed by the rules
 laid down in the Vinaya pitaka." 
A Bhiksu's life is governed by 250 
precepts under the most common monastic 
code. 
"The Three Thousand Awesome Demeanors of
 monks and nuns are derived from the 
four deportments: walking, standing, 
sitting and lying down. It is said, '
Walk like the wind, stand like a pine;/
Sit like a bell and lie like a bow.' 
Walking like the wind does not mean 
imitating a tornado, nor even the kind 
of half jog that many people use to get 
from one place to another. The wind 
which should serve as a model for 
walking is the gentle zephyr, which does
 not even ripple the surface of a still 
pond. To stand like a pine is to stand 
<pb n="392"/>
up straight, not slumped over as if 
totally devoid of energy. The head 
should not hang as if looking only at 
the ground; the gaze should be regulated
 and should not dart furtively back and 
forth like that of a thief. To sit like 
a bell is to be erect and solid yet 
quite natural and spontaneous. In lying 
down, the legs should be drawn up 
slightly like a bow." 
"In the beginning all Bhiksus without 
exception led a life of wandering. 
During the rainy period, however, they 
were obliged to spend three months in a 
monastery (vihara). According to 
tradition the reason for this was that 
during the rainy season a wandering monk
 could cause too much damage to the 
animal and plant worlds. During this 
period of repose, leaving the monastery 
was permitted only under certain 
conditions, such as visiting...the sick.
" 
Warning
"When a monk lives in the age of the 
True Law, he should never make 
discriminations in regard to people. But
 when a monk lives in this age of the 
Degenerate Law, he should fear nothing 
more than failing to make 
<pb n="393"/>
discriminations in regard to people. The
 reason is that in this last age of the 
Law, good and bad elements mingle 
together. If one does not make a right 
judgement but chooses the wrong person, 
if one regards him who is heterodox as 
orthodox, if one becomes friendly with 
him whom he ought to avoid and avoids 
him whom he ought to be friendly with, 
one will surely become the same as one's
 teacher. Furthermore, in future lives 
he will always be a companion to Mara (q
.v.). Is it then not apparent that one 
has to be watchful in seeking out a 
teacher?" (Patriarch Chu Hung)

<_-xa>Meditation Sutra，禪經</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Ajatasatru，阿闍世王</_-xa>; <_-xa>Vaidehi，韋提夫人
</_-xa>

"King of Magadha at the time of the 
Buddha; built the city of Rajagrha (
Bihar / India). He converted to Buddhism
 and presented the Bamboo Grove to the 
Buddha for the use of the Sangha. He was
 murdered by his son Ajatasatru." 

Background
"Bimbisara in his past life was also a 
king. One day, traveling through the 
Vipula Mountains on a deer hunt, he 
found himself sadly without a catch. In 
meeting up with an ascetic, the king 
decided to chase him on horseback, and 
in the end he ordered him killed. The 
ascetic as he was about to die made a 
malevolent vow, 'I vow to return in my 
next life and just as you have destroyed
<pb n="397"/>
 me today, I shall mentally and verbally
 destroy you."' (The ascetic is said to 
have been reborn as Ajatasatru, the King
's only son and heir to the throne.) 
There is another more poetic version of 
this story (see Ajatasatru). Both 
accounts however make the point of 
Ajatasatru being unjustly killed in his 
previous incarnation by his present 
father King Bimbisara. The story of King
 Bimbisara and Ajatasatru appears at the
 beginning of the Meditation Sutra, a 
key Pure Land text.

<xa>BIRTH</xa>
<_-xa>Samsara，輪回</_-xa>; <_-xa>Four Forms 
of Birth，四生</_-xa>

"The state of transmigration, or Samsara
, where beings repeat cycles of birth 
and death according to the law of karma.
" 
See the following passage on the need to
 escape Birth and Death:
"But why do we need to escape from the 
cycle of birth and death? It is because,
 in the wasteland of birth and death, we
<pb n="398"/>
 truly undergo immense pain and 
suffering. If students of Buddhism do 
not sincerely meditate on this Truth of 
Suffering, they cannot achieve results 
despite all their scholarship, as they 
do not experience fear or seek 
liberation." (Buddhism of Wisdom and 
Faith, sect. 4.) 
In the Buddhist world view, the 
probability of eliminating all Delusions
 of Views and Thought and escaping Birth
 and Death in one lifetime of 
cultivation is practically nil. (
Apparent exceptions are practitioners in
 the last lifetime of cultivation or 
Bodhisattvas who have taken human form 
to convert sentient beings.) After all, 
even Buddha Sakyamuni, the founder of 
Buddhism, underwent eons of rebirth as 
exemplified in the Jataka Tales. This is
 also the case with Buddha Amitabha and 
the Bodhisattva Maitreya -- the Buddha 
of the future. 
Illustrative Story
"In India there was once a king who 
believed in a non-Buddhist religion 
which taught many kinds of bitter 
practices ... some spread ashes on their
 bodies, and some slept on beds of nails
. They cultivated all kinds of ascetic 
<pb n="399"/>
practices. Meanwhile, the bhikshus who 
cultivated the Buddhadharma had it 'easy
,' because they didn't cultivate that 
way. Now, the king of that country said 
to the Buddha's disciples, 'It's my 
belief that the ascetic practices which 
these non-Buddhists cultivate still don'
t enable them to end their afflictions. 
How much the less must you bhikshus, who
 are so casual, be able to sever the 
affliction of your thoughts of sexual 
desire.' One of the Dharma Masters 
answered the king this way: 'Suppose you
 take a man from jail who had been 
sentenced to execution, and you say to 
him 'Take this bowl of oil and carry it 
in your two hands as you walk down the 
highway. If you don't spill a single 
drop, I'll release you when you return.'
 Then, suppose you send some beautiful 
women musicians out on the highway to 
sing and play their instruments where 
the sentenced man is walking with his 
bowl of oil. If he should spill any oil,
 of course, you'll execute him. But if 
he should come back without spilling a 
single drop, what do you suppose he will
 answer if you ask him what he's seen on
 the road?' The king of country did just
 that: he took a man destined to be 
<pb n="400"/>
executed and said to him, 'Today you 
should be executed but I'm going to give
 you an opportunity to save your life. 
How? I'11 give you a bowl of oil to 
carry in your two hands as you take a 
walk on the highway.
If you can do it without spilling a 
single drop, I'll spare your life. Go 
try it.' The sentenced man did as he was
 told. He went out on the highway, and 
when he returned he had not spilled one 
drop. Then the king asked him, 'What did
 you see out on the highway?' The 
sentenced man said, 'I didn't see a 
single thing. All I did was watch the 
oil to keep it from spilling. I didn't 
see anything else or hear anything at 
all.' So, the king asked the Dharma 
Master, 'Well, what is the principle 
here?' The Dharma Master answered, 'The 
sentenced man was like the (novice) who 
has left the home life. Both see the 
question of Birth and Death as too 
important to waste time on thoughts of 
sexual desire, (the most dangerous 
affliction for ascetics). Why can't the 
non-Buddhists sever their afflictions? 
Because they don't understand Birth and 
Death. They don't realize haw great the 
importance of this matter is.'"

 damaging sentient life. Termination of 
pregnancy, on the other hand, 
necessarily occurs after conception, so 
it is not advised."

"Is birth control allowed in Buddhism?
Yes, depending on the method. Birth 
control methods that prevent conception 
are permitted. However, once conception 
has taken place and consciousness has 
entered the fertilized egg, it's a 
different situation. Thus, morning-after
 pills and other such methods are

<xa>BODHI，菩提</xa>
<_-xa>Enlightenment</_-xa>; <_-xa>Awakening
 vs. Enlightenment</_-xa>



<xa>BODHI</xa>
<_-xa>Great Mind</_-xa>; <_-xa>Bodhisattva</_-xa>

Skt/Bodhicitta; Vn/Bb-De Tam. The spirit
 of Enlightenment, the aspiration to 
achieve it, the Mind set on 
Enlightenment. It involves two parallel 
aspects; i) the determination to achieve
 Buddhahood and ii) the aspiration to 
rescue all beings. 
The goal of all Mahayana practice is to 
achieve Enlightenment and transcend the 
cycle of Birth and Death -- that is, to 
attain Buddhahood. In the Mahayana 
tradition, the precondition for 
Buddhahood is the Bodhi Mind (bodhicitta
), the aspiration to achieve full and 
complete Enlightenment for the benefit 
<pb n="407"/>
of all sentient beings, oneself included
. 
Buddhism of Wisdom ＆ Faith/ excerpts:
"The Avatamsaka Sutra states: 'To 
neglect the Bodhi Mind when practicing 
good deeds is the action of demons.' 
This teaching is very true indeed. For 
example, if someone begins walking 
without knowing the destination or goal 
of his journey, isn't his trip bound to 
be circuitous, tiring and useless? It is
 the same for the cultivator. If he 
expends a great deal of effort but 
forgets the goal of attaining Buddhahood
 to benefit himself and others, all his 
efforts will merely bring merits in the 
human and celestial realms. In the end 
he will still be deluded and revolve in 
the cycle of Birth and Death, undergoing
 immense suffering. If this is not the 
action of demons, what, then, is it? For
 this reason, developing the supreme 
Bodhi Mind to benefit oneself and others
 should be recognized as a crucial step 
in all Mahayana schools." 

Pure Land Buddhism 
"The word 'Bodhi' means 'enlightened'. 
There are three main stages of 
Enlightenment: the Enlightenment of the 
<pb n="408"/>
Sravakas (Hearers); the Enlightenment of
 the Pratyeka (Self-Awakened) Buddhas; 
the Enlightenment of the Buddhas. What 
Pure Land practitioners who develop the 
Bodhi Mind are seeking is precisely the 
Enlightenment of the Buddhas. This stage
 of Buddhahood is the highest, 
transcending those of the Sravakas and 
Pratyeka Buddhas, and is therefore 
called Supreme Enlightenment or Supreme 
Bodhi. This Supreme Bodhi Mind contains 
two principal seeds, Compassion and 
Wisdom, from which emanates the great 
undertaking of rescuing oneself and all 
other sentient beings. To reiterate, the
 Bodhi Mind I am referring to here is 
the supreme, perfect Bodhi Mind of the 
Buddhas, not the Bodhi Mind of the 
Sravakas or Pratyeka Buddhas. 
"The practitioner should clearly realize
 the goal of rebirth -which is to seek 
escape from suffering for himself and 
all sentient beings. He should think 
thus: 'My own strength is limited, I am 
still bound by karma; moreover, in this 
evil, defiled life, the circumstances 
and conditions leading to afflictions 
are overpowering. That is why other 
sentient beings and myself are drowning 
in the river of delusion, wandering 
<pb n="409"/>
along the Evil Paths from time 
immemorial. The wheel of birth and death
 is spinning without end; how can I find
 a way to rescue myself and others in a 
safe, sure manner? There is but one 
solution: it is to seek rebirth in the 
Pure Land, draw close to the Buddhas and
 Bodhisattvas, and, relying on the 
supremely auspicious environment of that
 realm, engage in cultivation and attain
 the Tolerance of NonBirth. Only then 
can I enter the evil world to rescue 
sentient beings.' The Treatise on 
Rebirth states: 'To develop the Bodhi 
Mind is precisely to seek Buddhahood; to
 seek Buddhahood is to develop the mind 
of rescuing sentient beings; and the 
mind of rescuing sentient beings is none
 other than the mind that gathers in all
 beings and helps them achieve rebirth 
in the Pure Land.'" 
"Patriarch Tao-ch'o recognized like Tien
 Tai Patriarch Chih-i that neither the 
creation of Pure Lands nor their 
appropriation by believers was the final
 goal. The purpose of all sentient 
beings is the attainment of 
enlightenment. In fact, no one can be 
reborn in the Pure Land until he or she 
awakens the resolve to attain 
<pb n="410"/>
enlightenment (Bodhi-Mind). To support 
this assertion, Tao-ch'o quoted from the
 Wu-liang-shouching (Longer Amitabha 
Sutra) ... The emphasis that Tao-ch'o 
placed on the Bodhi-Mind can be seen by 
the fact that his chapter on the Bodhi-
Mind is the longest one in the An-lo-chi
 (Peace and Bliss Collection), occupying
 more than a quarter of the text." 
Illustrative Story 
In days of yore, an older master was 
traveling along a winding country road, 
followed by a disciple carrying his bags
. As they walked, they saw lands being 
tilled while farmers and oxen were 
strained to the utmost. Countless worms 
and insects were maimed or killed in the
 process, and birds were swooping to eat
 them. This led the disciple to wonder 
to himself, "How hard it is to make a 
living. I will cultivate with all my 
strength, become a Buddha and rescue all
 these creatures." Immediately the 
Master, an Arhat able to read the 
thoughts of others, turned around and 
said, "Let me have those heavy bags and 
I will follow you." The disciple was 
puzzled but did as instructed, changing 
places with his teacher and walking in 
front. As they continued on their way 
<pb n="411"/>
with the hot sun bearing down on them, 
dust swirling all around them, the road 
stretching endlessly in front, the 
disciple grew more and more tired. It 
wasn't long before he thought to himself
, "There are so many sentient beings and
 there is so much suffering, how can I 
possibly help them all? Perhaps I should
 try to help myself first." Immediately,
 the Master behind him said, "Stop. Now 
you carry the bags and follow me." The 
puzzled disciple did as told, knowing he
 was not supposed to ask questions. He 
took up the bags again and walked behind
. This sequence repeated itself several 
times. The Master walked in front with 
the disciple carrying the bags, then the
 disciple in front with the Master 
carrying the bags, back and forth, until
 noontime came and they stopped for 
lunch. Then the disciple gathered his 
courage and asked the reason why. The 
Master said, "When you had exalted 
thoughts of saving all living beings, 
you were a Bodhisattva in thought, and I
 as an Arhat had to follow you. But as 
soon as you had selfish thoughts of 
saving yourself only, you were no longer
 a Bodhisattva, and being junior to me 
in years and cultivation, you had to 
<pb n="412"/>
carry my bags."

develop the Bodhi Mind, see Buddhism of

"Deeply learned Indian Buddhist monk who
 arrived at the Chinese Court in A.D. 
520. Known in China as Tamo, and in 
Japan as Daruma. After his famous 
interview with Emperor Wu, he meditated 
for nine years in silence and departed. 
Bodhidharma was the twenty-eighth Indian
 and first Chinese Zen Patriarch. The 
father of Zen Buddhism, although it was 
left to Masters of the eighth century, 
led by Hui-neng, to consolidate his 
teaching and technique into a school of 
Buddhism." 
"After his arrival in what is today the 
port city of Canton, he traveled at the 
invitation of the Emperor Wu of the 
Liang Dynasty (6th C.) to visit him in 
Nanking. The first example in the Pi-yen
-1u reports the encounter between 
Bodhidharma and the emperor. Wu-ti was a
 follower and fosterer of Buddhism and 
had many Buddhist monasteries built in 
his realm. Now he asked the master from 
India what merit and virtues for 
succeeding lives he had accumulated 
thereby. Bodhidharma answered curtly, '
<pb n="414"/>
no virtues, none' ... The encounter with
 Emperor Wu of Liang showed Bodhidharma 
that the time was not yet ripe for the 
reception of his teaching in China. He 
crossed the Yangtse -as the legend tells
 us, on a reed (this is a favorite 
subject in Zen painting) -- and traveled
 on to north China, where he finally 
settled at Shao-lin Monastery (q.v.). It
 is not certain whether he died there or
 again left the monastery after he had 
transmitted the patriarchy to Hui-k'o. 
The form of meditative practice that 
Bodhidharma taught still owed a great 
deal to Indian Buddhism. His 
instructions were to a great extent 
based on the traditional sutras of 
Mahayana Buddhism; he especially 
emphasized the importance of the 
Iankavatara Sutra. Typical Chinese Zen 
is a fusion of the Dhyana (meditational)
 Buddhism represented by Bodhidharma (
under a covering of) indigenous Chinese 
Taoism. It is described as a 'special 
transmission outside the orthodox 
teaching."'

Merits/Virtues
According to the ancient masters, the 
reason Emperor Wu did not understand 
<pb n="415"/>
Bodhidharma was that he did not grasp 
the difference between merit and virtue.
 Merit results from good deeds and 
therefore brings benefits within the 
realm of Birth and Death. Virtues, on 
the other hand, are the result of 
actions that the practitioners take to 
improve themselves and others (i.e., 
decrease in greed, anger and ignorance).
 Thus, the benefits accrued are beyond 
Birth and Death. Therefore, merits are 
finite and considered of minor value in 
comparison to virtues. Had the emperor 
understood the distinction and realized 
that Bodhidharma had meant that he (the 
emperor) only received merits (as he was
 building temples, etc. with the 
expectation of receiving blessings, 
health, and wealth) not virtues (i.e., 
decrease in greed, anger, and stupidity)
, Bodhidharma would not have left him, 
the second Zen patriarch Hui K'o (q.v.) 
would not have had to cut his arms to 
prove his sincerity and the history of 
Zen might well have taken a different 
course!

<xa>BODHISATTVA，菩薩</xa>
<_-xa>Bodhi Mind</_-xa>; <_-xa>Paramita</_-xa>; <_-xa>Four Means of Salvation</_-xa>

Vn/Bo-tat. Those who aspire to Supreme 
Enlightenment and Buddhahood for 
themselves and all beings. The word 
Bodhisattva can therefore stand for 
realized beings such as Avalokitesvara 
or Samanthabhadra but also for anyone 
who has developed the Bodhi Mind -- the 
aspiration to save oneself and others. 
"One who aspires to the attainment of 
Buddhahood and devotes himself to 
altruistic deeds, especially deeds that 
cause others to attain enlightenment." 
Bodhisattvahood has the two aspects of 
self-perfection and benefitting others.
"Listen, for example, to the following 
from Asanga: 'If another does harm to 
the Bodhisattva, the latter endures with
 patience the worst injuries, with the 
<pb n="418"/>
idea that it is a benefit he has 
received. To think that the offender 
does one a service, this is to conduct 
oneself in accord with the example of 
the Perfect Ones, i.e., the Buddhas.'" (
From Asanga's Mahayana Sufralamkara). 
I. Background
"The notion of the Bodhisattva is 
already found in Theravada writings, 
where it refers to the historical Buddha
 Shakyamuni in his previous existences 
as they are described in the Jatakas. In
 Mahayana, the idea of the Bodhisattva 
is rooted in a belief in future Buddhas,
 who have long since existed as 
Bodhisattvas. The Mahayana distinguishes
 two kinds of Bodhisattvas -- earthly 
and transcendent. Earthly Bodhisattvas 
are persons (monks, nuns, lay people, 
etc) who are distinguished from others 
by their compassion and altruism as well
 as their striving toward the attainment
 of enlightenment. Transcendent 
Bodhisattvas have actualized the 
paramitas and attained Buddhahood but 
have postponed their entry into complete
 Nirvana. They are in possession of 
perfect wisdom and are no longer subject
 to Samsara. They appear in various 
forms in order to lead beings on the 
<pb n="419"/>
path to liberation. They are the object 
of the veneration of believers, who see 
them as showers of the way and helpers 
in time of need." 
"In early Buddhism the term Bodhisattva 
was used to identify Siddhartha Gautama,
 the historical Buddha, and it was 
assumed that only future historical 
Buddhas would merit this designation 
prior to their attainment of Buddhahood.
 In Mahayana, this term was given a 
radical, new interpretation, and used as
 a designation for anyone aspiring to 
complete, perfect Enlightenment...to 
Buddhahood. The entire Mahayana notion 
of the Bodhisattva was a clear 
antithesis to the ideal type in early 
Buddhism, the Arhat, whose effort was 
found by Mahayanists to be self-centered
 and ego-based. An enormous literature 
developed focusing on the Bodhisattva 
and the Bodhisattva path, including such
 famous texts as the 'Bodhisattvabhumi-
sutra ', 'Dasabhumika-sutra,' and others
." 
"Iconographically the ... Arhats are 
depicted as elderly shaven-headed monks,
 clad in yellow robes, and holding a 
begging-bowl or a staff; they stand 
stiffly, with compressed lips, and their
<pb n="420"/>
 attitude seems not altogether free from
 strain. The Bodhisattvas, by way of 
contrast, are all beautiful young 
princes. Gem-studded tiaras sparkle on 
their brows, while their nobly 
proportioned limbs are clad in light 
diaphanous garments of coloured silk. 
They wear gold bracelets and strings of 
jewels, and round their necks hang 
garlands of fragrant flowers. Their 
expression is smiling, their poses 
graceful and easy. These splendours do 
not indicate that the Bodhisattvas are 
laymen; they symbolise their status as 
heirs of the Buddha, the King of the 
Dharma, and the untold spiritual riches 
to which they will one day succeed when,
 in the final stages of their career, 
they are themselves consecrated to 
Buddhahood." 
In Mahayana, a number of Celestial 
Bodhisattvas became extremely important,
 most notably Avalokitesvara, Manjusri, 
Mahasthamaprapta, and Samantabhadra. 
They served as ideal models for their 
earthly counterparts by exhibiting deep 
compassion and wisdom (Prebish). The two
 most popular Bodhisattvas in Mahayana 
Buddhism are Avalokitesvara and 
Samantabhadra. Avalokitesvara, the 
<pb n="421"/>
Bodhisattva of compassion and one of the
 Three Pure Land sages, is represented 
on the right hand side of Amitabha 
Buddha (as we look at the Buddha). 
Samantabhadra is famous for his Ten 
Great Vows as described in the 
Avatamsaka Sutra. He is the 
transcendental first patriarch of the 
Pure Land school.
II. Illustrative Story
"In a thicket at the foot of the 
Himalayan Mountains there once lived a 
parrot together with many other animals 
and birds. One day a fire started in the
 thicket from the friction of bamboos in
 a strong wind and the birds and animals
 were in frightened confusion. The 
parrot, feeling compassion for their 
fright and suffering, and wishing to 
repay the kindness he had received in 
the bamboo thicket where he could 
shelter himself, tried to do all he 
could to save them. He dipped himself in
 a pond nearby and flew over the fire 
and shook off the drops of water to 
extinguish the fire. He repeated this 
diligently with a heart of compassion 
out of gratitude to the thicket. This 
spirit of kindness and self-sacrifice 
was noticed by a heavenly god who came 
<pb n="422"/>
down from the sky and said to the parrot
: 'You have a gallant mind, but what 
good do you expect to accomplish by a 
few drops of water against this great 
fire?' The parrot answered: 'There is 
nothing that cannot be accomplished by 
the spirit of compassion and self-
sacrifice. I will try over and over 
again and then over in the next life.' 
The great god was impressed by the 
parrot's spirit and they together 
extinguished the fire." (The Teaching of
 the Buddha) 
III. Notes: 
A. "Bodhisattvas fear causes sentient 
beings fear effects and results. 
Bodhisattvas, being wary of evil results
, eliminate evil causes. Sentient beings
 all too often vie to create evil causes
 and then have to endure evil results. 
When enduring suffering, they do not 
know enough to practice repentance, but 
create more evil karma in the hope of 
escaping retribution. Thus, injustice 
and retribution follow upon one another 
continuously, without end. It is so 
pitiful and frightening to think about 
it!" 
B. A Bodhisattva's vow: "With a sincere 
mind ... the Bodhisattva always compares
<pb n="423"/>
 himself to a handicapped person sitting
 at the crossroads; although he himself 
cannot walk, he strives to show others 
the way, reminding passersby to avoid 
the dangerous paths and follow the wide,
 even and peaceful way."

The Bodhisattva Precepts, 58 in number (
10 major, 48 minor), are listed and 
explained in the Brahma Net Sutra (q.v.)
. However, these precepts all derive 
from three key precepts called the Three
 Bodies of Pure Precepts (q.v.). The 
concept that receiving the precepts is 
not necessarily dependent upon their 
<pb n="424"/>
being administered by the clergy is a 
high-level teaching of Mahayana Buddhism
, which emphasizes the all-encompassing 
Mind. Any practitioner who wishes to 
receive the precepts, and sincerely and 
earnestly accepts them, has in fact 
received them. This is in line with the 
teachings of the Brahma Net Sutra, 
though in the case of the Bodhisattva 
precepts (the loftiest and most 
difficult set of precepts), the 
witnessing of an auspicious sign (light,
 flowers, the Buddhas coming to rub one'
s crown, etc.) is additionally necessary
. 
"The twenty-third minor Bodhisattva 
precept (taught that) whenever a person 
with wholesome intention sincerely 
wishes to receive the Bodhisattva 
precepts, he should first vow before the
 Buddhas and Bodhisattvas images, to 
accept and uphold the precepts and then 
cultivate repentance and reform for 
seven days. If during that period he 
experiences a vision of auspicious signs
, he has received the precepts ... It is
 essential that he experience an 
auspicious sign, for only then has he 
received the precepts before the Buddha 
and Bodhisattva images. If he has not 
<pb n="425"/>
obtained such auspicious signs, though 
he may have vowed before the Buddha 
images to accept and uphold the precepts
, he has not actually received them." (
The Buddha Speaks the Brahma Net Sutra, 
Part II, Commentary by Elder Master Hui 
Sheng, p. 6.). NOTE: Auspicious signs 
attest to the utter sincerity and 
earnestness of the practitioner. Self-
administration of the precepts is 
recommended only when there are no 
competent monks or nuns available within
 a reasonable distance. Otherwise, the 
practitioner may be guilty of arrogance.

This is a sutra of major significance in
 Mahayana Buddhism. In addition to 
containing the ten major precepts of 
Mahayana (see below), the sutra also 
contains forty-eight less important 
injunctions. These 58 major and minor 
precepts constitute the Bodhisattva 
Precepts, taken by most Mahayana monks 
and nuns and certain advanced lay 
practitioners. It is believed that the 
current version of the Brahma Net Sutra 
<pb n="430"/>
is only a fraction of the original sutra
, most of the rest having been lost. 
"The Brahma Net Sutra contains the ten 
rules of Mahayana, which are obligatory 
for every follower: avoidance of (1) 
killing, (2) stealing, (3) unchaste 
behavior, (4) lying, (5) use of 
intoxicants, (6) gossip, (7) boasting, (
8) envy, (9) resentment and ill will, (
10) slander of the three precious ones (
Buddha, Dharma and Sangha). Violation of
 these rules means expulsion from the 
sangha. The Brahmajala-Sutra (Brahma Net

important injunctions. In this sutra, 
too, permission is given for self-
ordination in cases where the 
requirements for an official ordination 
cannot be fulfilled."

"A Supremely Enlightened One, or '
Awakened One'. According to Mahayana 
tradition, Buddha Sakyamuni is the 
present one in a series of Buddhas, past
 and future." 
"Nowadays, the term 'Buddha' refers to 
the historical Buddha Sakyamuni. '
Buddhas' naturally refers to all 
enlightened beings." 
"For many of us, the expressions 'Buddha
' or 'the Buddha' refer to one 
<pb n="432"/>
historical person. This person is known 
to us as Siddharta Gautama, the Buddha 
who lived in India more than two 
thousand five hundred years ago and 
founded the religion of Buddhism. 
Another common name for this historical 
person, Shakyamuni ('The Sage of the 
Shakya Clan'), may also come to mind 
when we speak of 'Buddha.' But in the 
mythology of Mahayana Buddhism, 
Shakyamuni is a Buddha, certainly an 
important figure, and yet one of many 
Buddhas. He may serve as the mouthpiece,
 and the vehicle for revelation, but he 
is not unique." 
"The word Buddha means 'one who has 
woken up' -- i.e. from the mental sleep 
of the untrained mind -- but Buddhists 
have often preferred a traditional 
explanation. A Buddha is 'one who knows'
 the Dharma or basic truth of things. So
 anyone is a Buddha who has achieved the
 goal of the Buddhist path. More usually
 the word is used only of an individual 
of much greater cosmic significance: the
 Samma-samBuddha, 'one who has fully 
awakened in the right way' or 'one who 
has fully known in the right way'. Such 
a Buddha is extremely rare in the 
universe. Whole eons may pass before one
<pb n="433"/>
 is born. Buddhist modernists often lay 
stress on the human nature of the Buddha
, partly as an understandable reaction 
to pressure from the theistic 
missionaries. This can be misleading. 
Buddhahood is achieved in human 
circumstances as the culmination of many
 lives, but the penultimate life is 
always divine. It is in fact the result 
of striving for perfection for countless
 lives, being reborn in many different 
forms and conditions of being. 
Traditional Buddhism understands by the 
word Buddha neither man nor god, but one
 who has far transcended the nature of 
both -the Teacher of gods and men. From 
an early date, accounts of the life of 
the Buddha contained both human and 
cosmic elements. Modern historical 
scholarship attempted at first to 
construct a biography by eliminating all
 miraculous and marvellous elements as 
later additions, but there are serious 
methodological objections to this. 
Moreover by removing the more poetic and
 mythic elements of the Buddhist 
tradition, it creates a false impression
 of a rather dry intellectual philosophy
. This obscures the devotional aspect of
 early Buddhism." 
<pb n="434"/>
"The primary object of Buddhist 
teachings as a whole may be said to be 
Buddhahood. The term 'Buddha' means 
enlightened, and as such refers to the 
fully awake, fully realized, complete 
human being; what is perhaps more 
outstanding in the Avatamsaka sutra, 
however, is the universal or cosmic 
sense of Buddha. The scripture 
explicitly states that 'Buddha' is to be
 seen in all lands, all beings, and all 
things. This is a basic premise of the 
scripture's grand descriptions of the 
scope of Buddhahood; the individual 
human Buddha may be said to be one who 
is open to this level of awareness. 
Buddha is said to have many dimensions 
of embodiment. The multiplicity of 
Buddha-bodies at times may refer to all 
things or beings, or to the potential or
 realization of full awakening in 
individual human beings."

"Statues of Buddha or other famous 
individuals in Buddhism utilized as a 
symbol of respect and/or an object of 
devotion for Buddhist disciples. In the 
earliest tradition, no figures of Buddha
 were crafted for fear that such a 
gesture would develop into a cult of 
personality at best or a deification of 
Buddha at worst. Such a position is 
<pb n="436"/>
consistent with Buddha's repeated 
statements that he was just a man. In 
time, perhaps as early as the reign of 
King Kanisha (100 A.D.), as Buddha's 
absence was felt deeply and in 
similarity with other Indian religious 
traditions, Buddha-figures gradually 
began to appear, in both Theravada and 
Mahayana art. With the development of 
the Vajrayana tradition, an even greater
 emphasis developed around various 
Buddhist images, reflecting the 
significant role of their symbolism in 
the Tantric tradition. Within several 
hundred years, images could be found 
extensively in cave temples, monasteries
, and other sites." 
NOTE: 
"Before image-worship came into 
existence, symbol-worship was very 
popular in the history of Buddhism. In 
the beginning of the Christian era, the 
Bhakti (q.v.) movement started in 
Buddhism. The Buddha was no longer (
simply) a teacher or a superman. He was 
deified; the image-worship of the Buddha
 could somewhat satisfy the craving and 
devotional impulses of the masses. 
Before the introduction of image-worship
, a symbol like the Bodhi tree or the

Chin/ Nien-fo; Jpn/ Nembutsu; VN/ Niem 
Phat. The terms Buddha Remembrance and 
Buddhanusmrti (q.v.) are sometimes used 
in the same sense as Buddha Recitation.
I. SUMMARY
"The term Buddha Recitation has two 
meanings: 1) Buddhanusmrti. To meditate 
on the Buddha. This is the so-called 
Kannennembutsu. 2) To invoke the name of
 the Buddha. This is the so-called 
shomyo-nembutsu. From the time of T'an-
luan (Donran) onward, the term Buddha 
Recitation has usually referred to the 
latter, and, in the majority of cases, 
has referred to the invocation of the 
name of Amitabha Buddha in order to be 
reborn in his Pure Land." 
"The 'Buddha Recitation' practice 
comprises various aspects: hearing and 
calling the name, and meditating on 
Amitabha. Each of these actions leads to
 rebirth if the one condition is 
fulfilled: singleminded attentiveness, 
which (Patriarch) Shan-Tao in another 
context explained as performed from 
within the three mental dispositions of 
absolute sincerity, deep faith, and true
 desire to be reborn in the Pure Land." 
<pb n="442"/>
(PASBTP,p.81)
"In reciting the Buddha-name you use 
your own mind to be mindful of your own 
true self: how could this be considered 
seeking outside yourself'? Reciting the 
Buddha-name proceeds from the mind. The 
mind remembers Buddha and does not 
forget. That's why it is called Buddha 
remembrance, or reciting the Buddha-name
 mindfully." 
To recite the Buddha name is to replace 
deluded thoughts with thoughts about 
Buddha Amitabha, the Buddha of Infinite 
Light and Infinite Life (enlightened 
thoughts). Our Self-Nature True Mind, 
infinitely Bright and Everlasting, is 
precisely that Buddha Amitabha. Thus, to
 recite the Buddha name is to return to 
our Self Nature True Mind. As the 
ancients have said: "if Buddha 
Recitation is one-pointed, the Six 
Paramitas are present in full. If Buddha
 Recitation is one-pointed, our Mind is 
the Mind of the Buddha." 
"To achieve an uninterrupted state of 
samadhi is not something a person 
leading a secular life can accomplish. 
Since it is difficult to achieve samadhi
 this way, it is best that you hold fast
 to the name of the Buddha. Whenever you
<pb n="443"/>
 have the time, after studying and 
managing household affairs, you ought to
 recite it silently. In doing so, you 
should be careful to articulate each 
word clearly and to dwell on each 
utterance with all your heart. If you 
can continue doing this for a long time 
without relapsing, your mind will 
naturally be tamed, and this state is 
none other than samadhi." 
II. BACKGROUND
"If one were asked to define the single 
most representative feature of Pure Land
 practice, nienfo (Buddha Recitation) 
would probably be one's choice. As used 
colloquially among Chinese Buddhists 
today, nienfo can have two different 
meanings, depending on whether one takes
 it in its literal sense as 'mindful 
recollection (nien) of the Buddha (fo)' 
or its implied sense of 'intonation (
nien) of the Buddha's name.' The word 
nienfo (Buddha Recitation) is originally
 a Chinese translation of the Sanskrit 
compound Buddhanusmrti (q.v.), meaning '
the recollection or the bearing in mind 
(anusmrti) of the attributes of a Buddha
.' The practice of Buddhanusmrti itself 
has a long history in India, extending 
back to well before the rise of Mahayana
<pb n="444"/>
 Buddhism...
When the term and its practical lore 
were introduced to China, they came as a
 highly developed meditative system, 
with liaisons to a diversity of Buddhist
 scriptures and deities. Amitabha and 
the Pure Land sutras represented but one
 among many such systems. The major 
Indian sources and early Chinese 
treatises on Buddhanusmrti treat it as a
 complex practice involving several 
different approaches to contemplation. 
At its most basic level, Buddha-
mindfulness begins with visual 
recollection of the thirty-two major 
marks and eighty minor excellencies of 
the Buddha's glorified 'body of form' (
Sanskrit/rupa-kaya). Progressing to 
successively deeper levels of practice, 
one may dispense with recollection of 
the Buddha's physical form and instead 
contemplate his boundless spiritual 
powers and omniscience, until one 
ultimately arrives at the Buddha's 
formless essence of enlightenment itself
 -- a practice known as mindful 
recollection of the Buddha's 'body of 
truth or reality' (Sanskrit/Dharma-kaya)
. Thus, although Buddhanusmrti may take 
a particular Buddha or Bodhisattva (such
<pb n="445"/>
 as Amitabha) as its starting point, it 
ultimately grounds itself in universal 
Mahayana truths. This feature plants 
Buddhanusmrti firmly within the 
mainstream of Mahayana Buddhist practice
, connecting it with the meditations on 
emptiness that we more often associate 
with the Perfection of Wisdom and other 
less devotional traditions of Buddhist 
scripture." 
"The author tells us that some Buddhists
 find such recitation difficult; that 
when they begin to recite Buddha their 
hearts begin to feel very uneasy. 'A 
thought would pop up suddenly and 
suddenly fall down -- so restless in 
this way. The harder I try to keep my 
heart quiet, the disquieter my heart 
becomes.' (To such people, the author 
would reply as follows:) It is indeed 
not good to recite with the mouth and to
 think other things. But the mind of an 
ordinary man is generally disorderly. 
How can he have a quiet mind when he 
begins practicing recitation? You need 
only to have a sincere heart; slowly and
 gradually you are sure to have a quiet 
mind. Moreover, the disorder in your 
mind has already been there, and is not 
due to reciting the Buddha. For instance
<pb n="446"/>
, we cannot see the dust in the air 
until the shining of the sun. Before 
reciting Buddha you are not conscious of
 your manifold thoughts. Reciting Buddha
 makes you conscious of them, that's all
. When you feel that you have many 
thoughts, your mind has really improved 
to a quieter degree. You need only be 
patient and sincere in your recitation -
- you are sure to improve day by day.'"

"One invocation to Buddha Amitabha, if 
uttered properly, will immediately cause
 the six sense organs to become clean 
and clear. For instance, now while in 
the period of (Pure Land) practice, the 
organ of sight will be clean and pure as
 we always look at and see the Buddha. 
The organ of scent will be clean and 
pure as we inhale the aroma of incense. 
The tongue will be clean and pure as we 
recite Buddha's name repeatedly. The 
body will be clean and pure as we face 
and worship Buddha all day long in a 
clean and pure place. The mind will be 
clean and pure as we contemplate and 
think of Buddha. When the six sense 
organs are clean and pure, the three 
karmas are also cleansed; the physical 
evils of killing, stealing, and lust 
<pb n="447"/>
will no longer exist, nor the oral evils
 of hypocritical, harsh, deceitful and 
suggestive speech. There will be no 
involvement in the mental evils of greed
, hatred, and delusion. The Ten Good 
Karmas will immediately be practiced. A 
follower of Buddha finds it most 
difficult to curb the evil karmas 
committed by the body, tongue and mind. 
However, with one invocation of Buddha 
Amitabha's name, these three evils will 
be checked." 
III. BUDDHA RECITATION AND THE PARAMITAS
"Patriarch Chu-hung regarded the method 
of 'Buddha-invocation with one-
pointedness of mind' (i-hsin nien-fo) as
 the Buddha's greatest gift to man. For 
if a person can sincerely practice it, 
he is in fact training himself in the 
Six Perfections (paramitas) of a 
Bodhisattva: 'Now if a person practices 
i-hsin nien-fo (Buddha invocation with 
one mind), he will naturally stop 
clinging to external objects; this is 
the perfection of giving. If he 
practices it, his heart will naturally 
be soft and pliant; this is the 
perfection of patience. If he practices 
it, he will never retrogress; this is 
the perfection of vigor. If he practices
<pb n="448"/>
 it, no extraneous thoughts will arise; 
this is then the perfection of 
meditation. If he practices it, correct 
thoughts will appear distinctly; this is
 then the perfection of wisdom.' Thus, 
when Buddha invocation is carried out 
with one mind, it can lead to Buddhahood
."

We must also recognize that Discipline, 
Concentration, and Wisdom are equivalent
 to the Dharma-gate of Buddha Recitation
. How so? Discipline (precept-keeping) 
means preventing wrongdoing. If you can 
wholeheartedly practice Buddha 
Recitation, evil will not dare to enter:
 this is discipline. Concentration means
 eliminating the scattering 
characteristic of the ordinary mind. If 
you wholeheartedly practice Buddha 
Recitation, mind does not have any other
 object: this is concentration. Wisdom 
means clear perception. If you 
contemplate the sound of the Buddha's 
name with each syllable distinct, and 
also contemplate that the one who is 
mindful and the object of this 
mindfulness are both unattainable, this 
is wisdom (Master Chu-Hung, l6th c., 
China)
<pb n="449"/>

IV. BUDDHA RECITATION -ESSENCE AND 
PRACTICE
"There are two aspects to Buddha 
Recitation -- essence and practice. 
According to Elder Master Ou-I:
A) 'Buddha Recitation practice' means 
believing that there is a Western Pure 
Land and a Lord Buddha named Amitabha, 
but not yet realizing that 'this Mind 
makes Buddha, this Mind is Buddha.' It 
consists of resolutely seeking rebirth 
in the Pure Land and reciting as 
earnestly as a lost child longing for 
his mother, never forgetting her for a 
single moment. 'Buddha Recitationessence
,' on the other hand, means believing 
and understanding that Lord Amitabha 
Buddha of the West inherently exists in 
full within our mind, is created by our 
mind, and making this sacred name -
inherently existing in full within our 
mind and created by our mind -- the 
focus of our recitation, without a 
moment of neglect. In other words, '
Buddha Recitation-practice' is the 
method of those who do not understand 
anything about meaning or essence, who 
just believe that there is a Land of 
Ultimate Bliss and a Buddha named 
<pb n="450"/>
Amitabha, and who fervently and 
earnestly recite the Buddha's name 
seeking rebirth there. B) 'Buddha 
Recitation-essence' is the method of 
those who practice in an identical 
manner, but who also deeply realize that
 the Pure Land and Lord Amitabha Buddha 
are all in the True Mind, manifested by 
the pure virtues of the True Mind. This 
being so, is there a difference between 
Buddha Recitation-practice and Buddha 
Recitation-essence? Of course there is. 
Those who follow Buddha Recitation-
practice see Amitabha Buddha as outside 
the Mind; therefore, opposing marks of 
subject-object still exist. Thus, such 
practice is not yet all-encompassing and
 complete. Those who practice Buddha 
Recitation-essence thoroughly understand
 the True Mind and therefore sever all 
marks of subject-object -- to recite is 
Buddha, to recite is Mind, reconciling 
Mind and Realm." 
V. SCATTERED MIND RECITATION
"When the mouth recites Amitabha Buddha'
s name while the mind is focussed on the
 Buddha or rests on His name, it is 
called 'Settled Mind Buddha Recitation.'
 When we recite the Buddha's name but 
the mind is not on Amitabha Buddha and 
<pb n="451"/>
is lost in errant thought, it is called 
'Scattered Mind Buddha Recitation.' The 
effectiveness of 'Scattered Mind' is 
very much weaker than 'Settled Mind' 
Buddha Recitation. For this reason, 
since ancient times, good spiritual 
advisors have all exhorted us to recite 
with a settled mind, and not let our 
thoughts wander. Therefore, Buddha 
Recitation with a scattered mind cannot 
be held up as an example to be emulated.
 However, all external activities must 
reverberate in the Alaya consciousness. 
If reciting with a scattered mind were 
entirely ineffective, where would the 
sacred name of Amitabha come from? The 
very existence of the sacred name 
results from two conditions: first, the 
existing seeds arising from the Alaya 
consciousness; second, the power of 
outside action reflecting back inward. 
Therefore, we cannot say that 'Scattered
 Mind Buddha Recitation' is entirely 
without effect, albeit its effectiveness
 is much more limited than recitation 
with a settled mind. Thus, while 
reciting the Buddha's name with a 
scattered mind has never been advocated,
 its significance and effectiveness 
cannot be rejected either. For this 
<pb n="452"/>
reason, the ancients have handed down 
the following gatha: The sacred name of 
Amitabha Buddha is the supreme method,/
Why bother and fret over scattered 
thoughts!/Though clouds thousands of 
miles thick hide the sun's brightness/
All the world still benefits from its '
amber' light. Upon reflection, the above
 verse is quite accurate. This is 
because once the seeds of Buddha 
Recitation ripen in the Alaya 
consciousness, they trigger the sixth 
consciousness (i.e., the mind), leading 
to the development of pure thought and 
pure action. However, when the seeds of 
Buddha Recitation pass through the sixth
 consciousness, deep-seated defiled 
thoughts encroach upon them. Although 
these seeds ultimately manage to escape,
 their power has been greatly weakened. 
They are like the rays of the sun, which
, although radiant, are hidden by many 
layers of clouds and are seen in the 
world only as 'amber' light. This 
residual light however, comes from the 
sun. Realizing this, the Pure Land 
practitioner need not be unduly worried 
or concerned about sundry thoughts. He 
should continuously recite, content with
 whatever number of utterances he 
<pb n="453"/>
manages to produce with right thought. 
As he recites in such a manner over an 
extended period of time, the horse-like 
mind will return to the stable, the 
monkey-like mind will gradually return 
to the den. With further recitation, 
right thought will emerge clearly 
without any special effort on the 
practitioner's part. Thus, we should 
emphasize the continuity of recitation, 
without worrying whether it is done with
 a settled mind or not. Like muddy water
 which, with constant decanting, becomes
 clear and pure, a person afflicted with
 many sundry thoughts, through extended 
recitation, can convert them into right 
thought. We should know that ancient 
masters would always recite the Buddha's
 name whether walking or standing, 
asleep or awake, working or resting. If 
they constantly recited with a settled 
mind, they would trip and stumble while 
walking and could not succeed in 
drafting commentaries or performing 
other tasks. Therefore, at times they 
recited with a scattered mind, but they 
never stopped reciting because even 
though their minds were scattered, not 
all benefits were lost." 
VI. NOTES: 
<pb n="454"/>
The strength and pervasiveness of Pure 
Land are such that its main practice, 
Buddha Recitation, is found in other 
schools, including the Tantric and Zen 
schools. In Pure Land, recitation is 
practiced for the immediate purpose of 
achieving rebirth in the Land of 
Amitabha Buddha. In the Tantric school, 
the immediate aim is to destroy evil 
karma and afflictions and generate 
blessings and wisdom in the current 
lifetime. In Zen, the koan of Buddha 
Recitation is meant to sever delusive 
thought and realize the Self-Nature True
 Mind. The ultimate goal of all three 
schools is, of course, the same: to 
achieve enlightenment and Buddhahood. 
Buddha Recitation, like the use of kung 
an in Zen, is a panacea to destroy the 
poison of false thinking ... It is like 
fighting a war to end all wars. 
According to the Pure Land school, 
however, recitation of the Buddha's name
 contains an additional element: the 
practitioner by association absorbs some
 of the merits and virtues of the Buddha
 himself. As the sutras state: "it is 
like a man walking in the morning mist -
- he is not wet, merely refreshed." 
"Whether one enters a monastery or 
<pb n="455"/>
prefers to remain in the lay world, 
there can be no progress in 
concentration without a severe reduction
 in one's involvement in worldly affairs
. Naturally, the external observances of
 the monastic rule are understood to be 
peculiarly propitious to the development
 of mental calm, but in the last 
analysis, it is inner motive and 
personal discipline that count. Thus we 
are counseled at length to be careful 
about the company we keep, recognizing 
the simple fact that an unexamined 
lifestyle, in which we are immersed in 
the materialistic values and behavior of
 worldly friends, will get us nowhere. 
Only frustration and inanity will be the
 result. Shantideva advises us to (avoid
) those whose values are contrary to the
 Dharma."

Buddha Recitation, see "Oral Recitation

Methods)".

Note: Please read entry "Buddha 
Recitation" before the following 
excerpts from Buddhism of Wisdom and 
Faith/ Master Thich Thien Tam: 
"Buddha Recitation does not consist of 
oral recitation alone, but also includes
 contemplation and meditation. Therefore
, within the Pure Land School, there are
, in addition to Oral Recitation, three 
other methods: Real Mark, Contemplation 
by Thought and Contemplation of an Image
.
I. REAL MARK (SELF-NATURE) BUDDHA 
RECITATION. This entails penetrating the
 Mind's foremost meaning -- reciting our
 own original Buddha Nature. It is to 
contemplate the Real Mark Dharma Body of
 the Buddhas, resulting in attainment of
 True Thusness Samadhi. This method is 
really a Zen practice; however; since 
the realm revealed by the meditational 
mind is the Pure Land, it also qualifies
 as a Pure Land practice. This method is
 not for those of limited or moderate 
capacities -- if the practitioner is not
 of the highest capacity, he cannot "
<pb n="457"/>
become enlightened and enter" into it. 
For this reason, few Pure Land teachers 
promote it and the proponents of the 
method are found chiefly within the Zen 
tradition. Incidentally, I would venture
 to say here that while we are still 
treading the path of Practice, not 
having reached the stage of Perfect 
Enlightenment, all Dharma methods are 
expedient and so is Zen. According to 
the Three Pure Land sutras, Buddha 
Sakyamuni provided the expedient 
teaching of the Western Pure Land, and 
urged sentient beings to recite Amitabha
 Buddha's name seeking rebirth there. 
With this method, they can escape Birth 
and Death, avail themselves of that 
wonderful, lofty realm to pursue 
cultivation, and swiftly attain 
Buddhahood. Diligent Buddha Recitation 
also leads to Awakening, as in Zen; 
however, the principal goal of the Pure 
Land School is rebirth in the Land of 
Ultimate Bliss, while the degree of 
Awakening achieved is a secondary 
consideration. Thus, the goal of Real 
Mark Buddha Recitation falls within Pure
 Land teachings. However, from the 
standpoint of an expedient leading to 
rebirth in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, 
<pb n="458"/>
it does not truly qualify as a Pure Land
 method within the meaning of the Three 
Pure Land sutras taught by Buddha 
Sakyamuni. This is, perhaps, the reason 
why Pure Land Patriarchs merely referred
 to it to broaden the meaning of Buddha 
Recitation, but did not expound it 
widely.
II. CONTEMPLATION BY THOUGHT RECITATION.
 This entails meditation on the features
 of Buddha Amitabha and His Land of 
Ultimate Bliss, in accordance with the 
Meditation Sutra. (The Sutra teaches a 
total of sixteen contemplations.) If 
this practice is perfected, the 
cultivator will always visualize the 
Pure Land before him. Whether his eyes 
are open or closed, his mind and 
thoughts are always coursing through the
 Pure Land. At the time of death, he is 
assured of rebirth there. The virtues 
obtained through this method are immense
 and beyond imagination, but since the 
object of meditation is profound and 
subtle, few practitioners can achieve it
. This is because, in general, the 
method presents several difficulties: i)
 without knowing how to use expedients 
skillfully and flexibly during actual 
practice, one cannot easily succeed; ii)
<pb n="459"/>
 without the ability to remember images 
clearly, one cannot easily succeed, iii)
 with low energy, one cannot easily 
succeed. Very few can avoid these 
pitfalls. Thus, upon reflection, this 
method also belongs to the category of 
difficult Dharma doors.
III. CONTEMPLATION OF AN IMAGE 
RECITATION. In this method, the 
practitioner faces a statue of Amitabha 
Buddha and impresses all the features of
 that statue on his memory -
contemplating to the point where, even 
in the absence of a statue, and whether 
his eyes are open or closed, he clearly 
sees the image of Amitabha Buddha. This 
method is also difficult, because it 
requires a great deal of energy, a 
faithful memory and skillful use of 
expedients. There are cases of 
individuals who have practiced it in an 
inflexible way and have developed 
headaches difficult to cure. Moreover, 
upon examination, this method of seeking
 rebirth in the Pure Land is not 
mentioned in the sutras. It is merely a 
technique to assist in the practice of 
Buddha Recitation, so that the 
practitioner can harness his mind and 
achieve right thought. Still, if we 
<pb n="460"/>
Practice this method in a pure, devoted 
frame of mind, we can obtain a response,
 eradicate our bad karma, develop virtue
 and wisdom, and, through an "illusory" 
statue of Amitabha Buddha, awaken to His
 True Marks and achieve rebirth in the 
Pure Land.
 IV. ORAL RECITATION/ INVOCATION. "In 
this method, the practitioner recites, 
aloud or silently, either 'Nam Mo 
Amitabha Buddha' or 'Amitabha Buddha.' 
The short form (Amitabha Buddha) has the
 advantage of easily focussing the 
cultivator's mind, while the longer 
version facilitates development of a 
truly earnest, respectful mind conducive
 to a response. This method, taught by 
Sakyamuni Buddha in the Shorter Amitabha
 Sutra, is the dominant form of Pure 
Land practice at the present time." 
"The ancients have commented: Among 
Dharma methods (Buddhist schools),/ Pure
 Land is the shortcut for attaining the 
Way;/ Within Pure Land,/ Oral Invocation
 is the shortcut. Nowadays, this method 
(Oral Invocation) is the most popular 
form of Buddha Recitation."

<pb n="466"/>
nature appears whenever the defilements

permanently removed." 
NOTE: 
Crucial Mahayana teaching. We all have 
the Buddha nature within us, but it is 
hidden by delusion. If, through a good 
action (reciting the Buddha-name, 
drawing an image of the Buddha in the 
sand, etc.) a cultivator has calmed the 
turbid waters of his mind, he has, in 
effect, recovered his Buddhahood -- he 
has achieved Buddhahood for that moment.
 "Even if little boys in play/ should 
use a piece of grass or wood or a brush,
/ or perhaps a fingernail/ to draw an 
image of the Buddha,/ such persons as 
these .../ all have attained the Buddha 
Way." (Burton Watson, tr., The Lotus 
Sutra, p. 39.) This, of course, does not
 mean that he has the same spiritual 
powers as the Buddha, but that his mind 
is now the mind of a Buddha -- and that 
is the first step. If he can achieve 
this, then although he may dwell in the 
realm of birth and death, he no longer 
fears birth and death -- birth and death
 can no longer pollute his mind.

<xa>BUDDHANUSMRTI，念佛</xa>
<_-xa>Buddha Recitation</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Buddha Remembrance</_-xa>; <_-xa>Pure Land
 Buddhism (summary)</_-xa>

"The word nien-fo (Buddha Recitation) is
 originally a Chinese translation of the
 Sanskrit compound Buddhanusmrti, 
meaning 'the recollection or the bearing
 in mind (anusmrti) of the attributes of
 a Buddha.' The practice of 
Buddhanusmrti itself has a long history 
in India, extending back to well before 
the rise of Mahayana Buddhism... When 
the term and its practical lore were 
introduced to China, they came as a 
highly developed meditative system, with
 ties to a diversity of Buddhist 
scriptures and deities. Amitabha and the
 Pure Land sutras represented but one 
among many such systems. The major 
Indian sourcos and early Chinese 
treatises on Buddhanusmrti treat it as a
 complex practice involving several 
different approaches to contemplation. 
At its most basic level, Buddha-
mindfulness begins with visual 
recollection of the thirty-two major 
marks and eighty minor excellencies of 
<pb n="468"/>
the Buddha's glorified 'body of form' (
Sanskrit/rupa-kaya). Progressing to 
successively deeper levels of practice, 
one may dispense with recollection of 
the Buddha's physical form and instead 
contemplate his boundless spiritual 
powers and omniscience, until one 
ultimately arrives at the Buddha's 
formless essence of enlightenment itself
 -- a practice known as mindful 
recollection of the Buddha's 'body of 
truth or reality' (Sanskrit/Dharma-kaya)
. Thus, although Buddhanusmrti may take 
a particular Buddha or Bodhisattva (such
 as Amitabha) as its starting point, it 
ultimately grounds itself in universal 
Mahayana truths. This feature plants 
Buddhanusmrti firmly within the 
mainstream of Mahayana Buddhist practice
, connecting it with the meditations on 
emptiness that we more often associate 
with the Perfection of Wisdom and other 
less devotional traditions of Buddhist 
scriptures."

"An early form of Buddhanusmrti (Buddha 
Remembrance or Buddha Recitation) can be
 found in the Nikayas of the Pali Canon:
 'In the Nikayas, the Buddha ...advised 
his disciples to think of him and his 
<pb n="469"/>
virtues as if they saw his body before 
his eyes, whereby they would be enabled 
to accumulate merit and attain Nirvana 
or be saved from transmigrating in the 
evil paths.'" D.T.Suzuki, The Eastern 
Buddhist/Vol 3, No 4 : 317

"The name given to the Teachings of

Founded by the Buddha (ca. 560-480 B.C.)
 and established by him in North-West

"The Buddha posited no creator God; no

 so distinct from the primary concerns 
of other faiths that some Western 
observers see Buddhism as a philosophy 
or even a psychology. By the same logic,

can be maintained without leaving one's

grass roots, Buddhism traveled from 
<pb n="472"/>

Vietnam and Tibet by way of royal courts
 or the literati." (Kennedy Fraser) NY 
Times: Nov. 3/97
I. SALIENT ASPECTS OF BUDDHISM:
"As Buddhism has gained popularity in 
their countries, Western people have 
naturally viewed the teachings through 
the lens of their own cultures and 
psychology. Among the attractive 
features are Buddhism's experiential 
orientation, its pragmatic approach to 
spirituality, and its variety. The 
theory of human psychology based on 
personal responsibility fits well with 
Western individualism. The teachings on 
morality, compassion, and selfless 
service corroborate our own Judeo-
Christian cultural heritage. The concept
 of karma, a law of cause and effect 
which extends to the mental and personal
 level, corresponds to the scientific 
principle of action and reaction in 
physics. And the common sense approach 
of Buddhist empiricism finds acceptance 
in the rational Western mind. At the 
same time, there are elements that go 
against the grain of Western cultural 
conditioning. Whereas the Buddha taught 
that happiness lies in limiting desires,
<pb n="473"/>
 American culture teaches that happiness
 can be found in fulfilling desires. 
While our culture teaches self-
assertiveness and the pursuit of self-
fulfillment, Buddhism teaches self-
denial and other-centeredness. There is 
a tension between the otherworldliness 
of Buddhism and the this-worldliness of 
contemporary American life. Even within 
the Buddhist fold there is a tension 
between the relative values of study and
 meditation, a tension that has existed 
in every Buddhist society to date."

"It is always the same aspects of the 
Buddhist religion that attract 
Westerners: Buddhism is tolerant. There 
may be a body of teaching but it does 
not dominate or preach to people. ... 
People also admire the justice of the 
Buddhist system, according to which 
people reap what they sow... The high 
quality of Buddhist ethics is widely 
praised. Who would quarrel with the 
splendid Four Noble Truths and the 
Eightfold Noble Path?" 
Buddhism aims at calming the mind, "
reining in the wandering, monkey mind," 
enabling the practitioner to uncover/
recover his innate wisdom and achieve 
<pb n="474"/>
Buddhahood. However, the more one reads 
and studies about Buddhism, the more one
 engages in discrimination and the more 
agitated the mind may become. Therefore,
 studying sutras and commentaries, while
 desirable, may not be the best method 
and is not a substitute for practice. (
This is why, in Zen, study is not 
emphasized and is sometimes considered 
merely a way of exercising the mind, 
just as sports are a way of exercising 
the body.) Note: One of the main 
purposes of studying sutras and 
commentaries from different schools is 
to prepare oneself to teach the Dharma 
to as wide an audience as possible. To 
achieve results in cultivation, on the 
other hand, one should concentrate on a 
single method or school. 
Important feature of Buddhism expressed 
in numerous Mahayana scriptures, such as
 the Lotus and Avatamsaka Sutras: the 
true intention of the Buddhas is not 
simply to rescue sentient beings, who, 
once saved, play a secondary, 
subservient role; rather, it is to help 
sentient beings attain Enlightenment and
 Buddhahood, i.e., to become equal to 
the Buddhas in all respects. This is a 
unique and revolutionary feature of 
<pb n="475"/>
Buddhism.
II. BRANCHES / TRADITIONS:
"The southern branch (Theravada, or 
school of the Elders) arose in southern 
India, whence it spread to Ceylon, Burma
, Thailand, and Cambodia. In Theravada 
Buddhism one strives to become an Arhat,
 a person who has single-heartedly 
overcome his passions and ego, thereby 
gaining liberation for himself. Because 
of its emphasis on individual self-
liberation, Theravada is known in 
northern Buddhist countries somewhat 
disparagingly as the Lesser Vehicle. The
 northern branch (Mahayana, or Great 
Vehicle) spread from northern India to 
Tibet, Mongolia, China, Vietnam, Korea, 
and Japan among other countries. In 
contrast to Theravada Buddhism, which 
tended to remain conservative and rigid,
 the Mahayana adapted itself to the 
needs of people of diverse racial and 
cultural backgrounds and varying levels 
of understanding. Its ideal became the 
Bodhisattva, one who is ever ready to 
sacrifice himself in the interest of 
those lost in ignorance and despair, 
even at the cost of (delaying) his own 
supreme enlightenment." 
Since every school or method is an 
<pb n="476"/>
expedient, adapted to a particular 
target audience, each one is perfect and
 complete for a given person or group at
 a given time.
<_-xa>the following passage from D.T. </_-xa>
"Buddhist theology has a fine 
comprehensive theory to explain the 
manifold types of experience in Buddhism
, which look so contradictory to each 
other. In fact the history of Chinese 
Buddhism is a series of attempts to 
reconcile the diverse schools ... 
Various ways of classification and 
reconciliation were offered, and ... the
 conclusion was this: Buddhism supplies 
us with so many gates to enter into the 
truth because of such a variety of human
 characters and temperaments and 
environments due to diversities of karma
. This is plainly depicted and taught by
 the Buddha himself when he says that 
the same water drunk by the cow and the 
cobra turns in one case into nourishing 
milk and in the other into deadly poison
, and that medicine is to be given 
according to disease. This is called the
 doctrine of (skillful) means ..." (The 
Eastern Buddhist, Vol. 4, No. 2, p.121)
In Buddhism, the sine qua non for 
Enlightenment and Buddhahood is a pure 
<pb n="477"/>
mind, that is, a mind free of greed, 
anger and delusion. In Pure Land 
Buddhism, the usual terminology is a 
mind of utmost reverence and sincerity, 
leading to one-pointedness of mind. This
 is because when the cultivator focusses
 singlemindly on Amitabha Buddha, he 
cannot harbor thoughts of greed, anger 
or delusion -- his mind is pure. A pure 
mind is Enlightenment, is the Pure Land.
 
III. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:
"The twentieth century has brought mixed
 fortunes for Buddhism. Communist rule 
has meant wholesale destruction, 
especially to the Sangha, first in the 
Asian territories of the Soviet Union 
and in Mongolia, then successively in 
North Korea, China, Tibet, Vietnam, Laos
, and Cambodia. Each of the traditions 
has suffered (only to see a resurgence 
in Buddhist devotion toward the latter 
part of the century, the case of China 
being the most noteworthy). The same 
period has seen a revival of activity 
and a return to lands long lost. Notably
 in Indonesia and in India, Buddhism has
 re-established its presence and won new
 support. More remarkably, new fields 
for expansion have emerged. In Europe, 
<pb n="478"/>
Southern Buddhism (Theravada) began to 
establish itself on a small scale as 
early as the beginning of the century. 
Northern Buddhism (Mahayana) in its Zen 
form started to attract a significant 
following outside the Asian immigrant 
communities in the 1950s, especially in 
North America. The work of Tibetan 
refugee teachers in the 1960s won 
support for Tibetan Buddhism. By the 
early 1980s some hundreds of Buddhist 
groups and centres were widely scattered
 across the Western world. Much of this 
activity is on a fairly small scale, but
 in many cases is quite well established
." 
NOTE:
"Western images of Buddhism have tended 
to center on some form of cerebral 
assimilation of Buddhist ideals. More 
often than not, Westerners have 
concerned themselves with a spirituality
 that is centered on self-cultivation by
 means of mental training and discipline
, or on the theories of monk-scholars. 
The end result of this self-cultivation 
is generally described as the attainment
, in this life, of a 'direct' spiritual 
experience. But for millions of Asian 
Buddhists, this image of Buddhism 
<pb n="479"/>
represents only a fraction of what comes
 to mind. There is more to Buddhism than
 meditation, renunciation, serenity, and
 mental cultivation, and more than the 
speculations of philosophers and 
scholars. The other side of Buddhism 
takes many forms, but if we focus only 
on the two Amitabha Sutras, we may say 
that throughout their history, they have
 been valued by Buddhists who believed 
in a plurality of 'transcendent' or '
celestial' Buddhas and relied on the '
saving grace' of these Buddhas. Thus, 
among those who consider themselves 
Buddhists, there are those who turn to 
the Buddha, or to many Buddhas, as a 
source of guidance and inspiration, and 
there are those who base their religious
 thought and practice on their faith in 
the saving power of the Buddhas. As one 
moves towards the latter of these two 
models, one enters the sphere of a 
Buddhism of faith and devotion." 
"In Buddhist tradition, the principles 
governing human conduct relate the 
characteristic condition of humanity (
suffering, unease, illness, caused by 
the basic evil of Desire) to the 
recognized goal of Buddhist endeavour, 
viz. complete enlightenment. Buddhist 
<pb n="480"/>
ethic thus favours those attitudes and 
kinds of behaviour which help humanity 
towards the ultimate goal of 
transcendental enlightenment; as an 
intermediate criterion, the goal of 
auspicious and wholesome rebirth (in a 
Pure Land) is important: whatever is 
conducive to this end is to be 
encouraged; whatever detracts is to be 
discouraged or renounced. The outworking
 of the Buddhist ethic is seen at the 
most elementary level in the 5 basic 
moral precepts (see Five Precepts), 
binding upon all Buddhists, monastic and
 lay."

fact-finding tour. Their report resulted
 in the arrival, the following year, of 
Reverend Shuei Sonoda and Reverend 
Kakuryo Nishijima who founded the (then 
called) Buddhist Mission of North 
America. Their organization ministered 
to the Japanese community in and around 
San Francisco. Complicated by the 
Japanese Immigration Exclusion Act of 
1924, and the Second World War, the 
organization grew only gradually until 
the late 1940s when, as the renamed 
Buddhist Churches of America, it began 
to expand its programs both 
geographically and financially. It now 
boasts centers across the United States,
 has an extensive educational program as
 well as a study institute in Berkeley, 
California, an aggressive publication

 stable organizations in the development
 of American Buddhism." 
NOTE:
Pure Land Buddhism was introduced to 
Japan via China and Korea. It eventually
 developed into the Jodo (Pure Land) 
school headed by Honen Shonin. Later on,
<pb n="482"/>
 Honen's best known disciple, Shinran 
Shonin, founded a branch of this school 
known as Jodo Shinshu or True Pure Land 
School. The development of this later 
school in the West has been hampered 
somewhat by its overwhelming emphasis on
 faith	and grace. Recently, however, 
there has been a movement within this 
school to diversify its teaching and 
membership by nominally' including some 
form of meditational Practice and to 
welcome more non-Japanese - members.




<xa>BUDDHIST</xa>
'Assemblies of monks held after 
Shakyamuni's death to compile and 
confirm the Buddha's teachings in order 
to preserve and transmit them correctly.
 It is said that four such councils were
 held during the four hundred years 
immediately following the Buddha's death
."

"The First Council was held at Rajagriha
 (India) immediately after the passing 
of the Buddha, the Venerable Kasyapa 
presiding. The Scriptures were recited 
<pb n="483"/>
by all, Ananda leading with the doctrine
 (sutras) and Upali with the Rules of 
the Order (precepts). The Second Council
 was held at Vaisali about 100 years 
later. Its purpose was to resolve a 
dispute within the Buddhist community 
over illicit monastic behavior. The 
Third Council was held in the reign of 
Asoka at Pataliputra (Patna) about 250 B
.C. Here the Canon was fixed, though not
 reduced to writing until the first 
century B.C. in Ceylon (Theravada canon)
. About A.D.100 a Fourth Council was 
held in Kashmir under the patronage of 
King Kanishka, but as the doctrines 
promulgated were exclusively Mahayana, 
this council is not recognized by all 
Buddhists. At that Council, five hundred
 monks revised the canon and established
 a definitive Mahayana version. The 
Fifth Council was held in 1871 at the 
instance of King Mindon of Burma, when 
the Theravada Tripitika was carved on 
729 marble slabs and preserved at 
Mandalay. The Sixth Great Council was 
opened in Rangoon at Vesak,1954, and sat
 until 1956 when Buddha Jayanti (
Observance of the 2,500th year of the 
Buddha era) opened. Meetings were held 
in a huge hall built specially near 
<pb n="484"/>
Rangoon in imitation of the Saptaparna 
Cave: 2,500 Bhikkhus took part in 
checking the entire Pali Canon."
I. FIRST BUDDHIST COUNCIL:
"The Rajagrha (Rajagriha) council, 
thought to be the first of its kind in 
Indian Buddhist history, convened in the
 year of Buddha's death to establish the
 Dharma and Vinaya (precepts). Fearful 
that the community would dissolve 
through uncertainty over Buddha's 
teachings, the Sangha decided to hold a 
council, generally thought to have 
occurred in 483 B.C., to preclude that 
possibility. King Bimbisara, one of the 
Buddha's royal patrons, donated the site
 in his capital city of Rajagrha, thus 
accounting for the name of the council. 
Kasyapa, a senior leading monk of the 
time who was appointed president of the 
council, selected 500 Arhat monks to 
participate in the proceedings. Buddha's
 disciple Upali recited all of the 
disciplinary rules, known as the Vinaya 
Pitaka, fixing that portion of the 
Buddhist canon. Ananda, Buddha's 
personal attendant re cited all Buddha's
 discourses establishing the Sutra 
Pitaka. Other business was conducted as 
well, with the council referring to 
<pb n="485"/>
itself as the 'Chanting of the Vinaya'. 
Functionally, it marks an important 
event in the history of the community, 
for it establishes authority for the 
group in the absence of its charismatic 
leader, while at the same time 
reinforcing communal solidarity." 
II. COUNCIL -- MAHAYANA
"Council held around 100 A.D. under the 
reign of the Indian King Kaniska. Near 
the end of the first century when 
Kaniska assumed the throne of the 
Kushana (Kusana) Dynasty, he tried to 
imitate the style of the great Indian 
ruler Asoka, while supporting the 
Sarvastivadin school (a precursor of the
 Mahayana). It was suggested to Kaniska 
that invitations be sent to all the 
learned Buddhists of the era to attend a
 council to be convened in Gandhara. A 
great scholar named Vasumitra was made 
president of the council, consisting of 
499 monks, and he was assisted by the 
learned Asvaghosa. In addition to 
compiling a new Vinaya, they prepared a 
commentary called the Mahavibhasa. This 
work was to become the standard 
reference work for all Sarvastivadin 
Abhidharma issues. It can be said that 
this council fulfilled the same role in 
<pb n="486"/>
Sarvastivadin history that Asoka's 
council (Third Buddhist Council) did for
 Theravadin history ... The school 
possessed a complete canon in Sanskrit, 
much of which is preserved today in 
Sanskrit fragments, as well as Chinese 
and Tibetan translations." 
III. MOST RECENT BUDDHIST COUNCIL:
"Reckoned to be the sixth Theravada 
council, held in Rangoon in 1954-1956 to
 recite and confirm the whole Pali Canon
. This council was convened so as to 
coincide in proximity with the 
celebration of 2500th anniversary of 
Buddha's death. The Prime Minister of 
Burma, U Nu, delivered the opening 
address to 2,500 monks in attendance. 
These monks edited and recited texts for
 two years, concluding on the 
anniversary date of Buddha's death 
according to the Burmese tradition. It 
was a national festival in Burma, but 
additionally established solidarity for 
Theravada Buddhists throughout the world

"Mahayana Buddhist monasteries 
theoretically celebrate between thirty-
five and forty events a year, but most 
are of minor importance. Apart from 
festivals common to all Asians, 
especially the Lunar New Year festival, 
six are particularly significant for 
Mahayana Buddhists:
Lunar Calendar: 
SECOND MONTH (l9th): Festival of the 
Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara 
FOURTH MONTH (15th): Vesak (Birth of 
Buddha Sakyamuni) (Rains Retreat Begins)
.
SIXTH MONTH (l9th): Festival of the 
Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara 
SEVENTH MONTH (15th): Ullambana ('
Festival of Hungry Ghosts'); (Rains 
Retreat Ends). 
NINTH MONTH (l9th): Festival of the 
Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara 
ELEVENTH MONTH (l7th): Festival of 
Amitabha Buddha 
The 'Rains Retreat' runs from the 
sixteenth day of the fourth month (one 
day after Vesak) to the fourteenth of 
<pb n="488"/>
the seventh... it is the festival which 
terminates the Rains Retreat which is 
the most important specifically Buddhist
 festival. The same is the case quite 
widely in the Buddhist world." 
In addition to the Ullambana festival, a
 key festival for all Buddhists is Vesak
. For Theravadins, Vesak commemorates 
the birth, enlightenment and passing of 
Sakyamuni Buddha, while for Mahayanists 
it commemorates His birth only.

<xa>BURN-OUT，操勞過度</xa>
"Question: How can we (Buddhists) 
prevent burnout when we are working for 
<pb n="489"/>
others' welfare? 
Answer: One way is to keep checking our 
motivation, continually renewing our 
compassionate intention. Another is to 
assess what we're capable of doing and 
to make realistic commitments. Sometimes
 we may be so inspired by the 
Bodhisattva ideal that we agree to 
participate in every project that comes 
in our way, even though we may lack the 
time or ability to complete (a number of
 these projects). Then we may push 
ourselves to the point of exhaustion to 
fulfill our commitments, or we may begin
 to resent those who are counting on our
 help. It's wise to consider before we 
commit, and to accept only those 
responsibilities that we can carry out. 
In addition, we must remember that 
difficulties and dissatisfaction are the
 nature of cyclic existence (Samsara). 
Preventing nuclear waste, dismantling 
apartheid, stopping the destruction of 
rain forests and helping the homeless 
are noble projects. However, even if a11
 these goals were achieved, it wouldn't 
solve all the world's ills. The chief 
source of suffering lies in the mind: as
 long as ignorance, greed and anger are 
present in people's minds, there will be
<pb n="490"/>
 no lasting peace on the earth. Thus, 
expecting our social welfare work to go 
smoothly, becoming attached to the 
results of our efforts, or thinking, 'if
 only this would happen, the problem 
would be solved' leads us to become 
discouraged. We need to remember that in
 cyclic existence, there are better and 
worse states, but all are temporary and 
none bring ultimate freedom. If we are 
realistic, we can work in the world 
without expecting to bring about 
paradise on earth. And we can also 
follow our spiritual practice (i.e. keep
 the precepts and develop Samadhi and 
Wisdom) knowing that it will lead to 
ultimate cessation of problems."

"Story of Ch'an master Pai Chang who 
liberated a wild fox: One day, after a 
Ch'an meeting, although all his 
disciples had retired, the old master 
Pai Chang noticed an elderly man who 
remained behind. Pai Chang asked the man
 what he was doing and he replied: 'I am
 not a human being but the spirit of a 
wild fox. In my previous life, I was the
 head-monk of this place. One day, a 
monk asked me, "Is an enlightened person
 still subject to cause and effect?" I 
<pb n="496"/>
replied, "No, He is not subject to 
causality." For this reply alone, I got 
involved in retribution and have now 
been the spirit of a wild fox for five 
hundred years, and am still unable to 
get away from it. Will the master be 
compassionate enough to enlighten me on 
all this.' Pai Chang said to the old man
: 'Ask me the same question and I will 
explain it to you.' The man then said to
 the master: 'I wish to ask the master 
this: Is an enlightened person still 
subject to cause and effect?' Pai Chang 
replied: 'He is not blind to cause and 
effect.' Thereupon, the old man was 
greatly awakened; he prostrated himself 
before the master to thank him and said:
 'I am indebted to you for your 
appropriate reply to the question and am
 now liberated from the fox's body. I 
live in a small grotto on the mountain 
behind and hope you will grant me the 
usual rites for a dead monk.' The 
following day, Pai Chang went to a 
mountain behind his monastery, where in 
a small grotto he probed the ground with
 his staff and discovered a dead fox for
 whom the usual funeral rites for a dead
 monk were held. Dear friends, after 
listening to (this story), you will 
<pb n="497"/>
realize that the law of causality is 
indeed a dreadful thing. Even after His 
attainment of Buddhahood, the Buddha 
still suffered a headache in retribution
 for His former acts. Retribution is 
infallible and fixed karma is 
inescapable: So we should always be 
heedful of all this and should be very 
careful about creating new causes." (
Chan Master Hsu Yun). 
 True realization of cause and effect 
can free us from a most pervasive 
affliction.' anger and resentment. Once,
 it is said, Buddha Sakyamuni was 
falsely accused of fathering a certain 
woman's child. When the deceit was 
discovered, the Buddha's followers 
wanted to beat the culprit to death. The
 Buddha calmly stopped them, saying:
"Oh, Bhikkus, in a previous lifetime 
when I was a king, I was once in a grove
 together with my courtiers. At the 
sight of an ascetic, the ladies of the 
party surrounded him, turning their 
backs on me. Jealous and angry, I 
exclaimed, How do you know that this 
ascetic is not a fake? How do you know 
that he does not spend his nights 
revelling with women? It is because of 
that slanderous remark that I have now 
<pb n="498"/>
had to endure that woman's deceit. Oh, 
monks, release her and let her go in 
peace." In the Buddhist world view, 
nothing happens without cause. To escape
 suffering, we must stop causing further
 suffering. Acting otherwise is no 
different than trying to escape one's 
shadow by running in the blazing sun! (
See "Chinchamanavika"). 
Pure Land Buddhism
A question often raised is what happens 
to the law of cause and effect, the 
basis of all Buddhist teachings, when a 
sinner is reborn in the Pure Land thanks
 to reciting the Buddha's name? 
(1) On the level of Mind (noumenon level
), since all transgression, worries and 
fears are born of delusion and ignorance
, once we are enlightened (through 
rebirth in the Pure Land), all these 
transgressions, worries and fears are 
gone. This is as if, in the dark, we 
mistakenly take a rope for a snake. When
 we switch on the light and realize that
 it is only a rope, there is no longer 
worry or fear -- nothing to change or 
repay, no remaining evil karma. 
(2) On the level of everyday life (
phenomenal level), good and evil karma 
do exist, but once we are enlightened 
<pb n="499"/>
and realize that nothing has intrinsic 
nature, evil karma and retribution no 
longer carry the heavy weight they do 
for ordinary beings. In fact, an 
enlightened person often uses such karma
 to help the very person he has wronged.
 For example, supposing there are two 
brothers playing a game of chance on the
 beach. The elder one, in a moment of 
greed, cheats on the younger one, who 
becomes angry and upset. Once their 
father convinces them that the game is 
only a make-believe, with no real gain 
or loss, the elder brother is awakened. 
He can then gladly accept his brother's 
anger and even turn around to help the 
younger one understand as well. 
(3) Another explanation of how a sinner 
can be reborn in the Pure Land is the 
other-power of Amitabha Buddha: "A 
minute grain of sand, dropped on the 
surface of the water, will sink 
immediately. On the other hand, a block 
of stone, however large and heavy, can 
easily be moved from place to place by 
boat. The same is true of the Pure Land 
practitioner. However light his karma 
may be, if he is not rescued by Amitabha
 Buddha, he is most likely to revolve in
 the cycle of birth and death. With the 
<pb n="500"/>
help of the Buddha, his karma, however 
heavy, will not prevent his rebirth in 
the Pure Land" ("Questions of King 
Milindra", in Thich Thien Tarn, Buddhism
 of Wisdom and Faith, sect. 68 A). 
NOTE:
"Devotional Buddhism does not maintain 
that rebirth in the Pure Land takes 
place without a cause, but that the 
primary factor in its causation is the 
invocation of the name of Amitabha. 
Hence this school cannot be regarded as 
denying the general principle of 
causality."

<_-xa>Cause and Effect</_-xa>

High level teaching of such Mahayana 
sutras as the Avatamsaka Sutra... "The

 the result has the cause as its result.
 It is like planting seeds: the seeds 
produce fruit, the fruit produces seeds.
" 
"Causes include the sea of results, the

<pb n="501"/>
source." 
This concept from the Avatamsaka and 
other Mahayana sutras can be understood 
through the analogy of apple seeds (
causes) leading to the apples of the 
future (results); the apples, in turn, 
contain within themselves the seeds of 
future trees and apples. In the same 
vein, sentient beings (causes) have the 
Buddha Nature within themselves, leading
 to Buddhahood (results); these Buddhas 
(results), in time, return to the world 
to rescue sentient beings (causes). Thus
, cause and result are inseparable -- 
cause is result, result is cause. As the
 sutras put it: "Causes encompass the 
sea of Results, and the Results extend 
back through the Causal sources."

<xa>CHIKO</xa>
<_-xa>Pure Land Mandalas</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Raigo</_-xa>; <_-xa>Taima Mandala</_-xa>

"Name of an eighth-century Japanese monk
 from Gango-ji (temple). The word is 
also applied to one of the three 
Japanese Pure Land mandalas (stylized 
paintings), which this monk 
traditionally envisioned." 
"The Chiko Mandala. Often called 'the 
first Pure Land mandala' because it is 
the oldest of the three Jodo mandalas (
the Chiko mandala can be traced to a 
legend from the eighth century). The 
earliest reference to this mandala as a 
Chiko mandala seems to be in the 
description of the Buddhist memorial 
service held for Fujiwara no Moromichi 
in 1909, which states that a paradise 
mandala --the Chiko Mandala-was hung as 
a devotional image. Tradition, however, 
ascribes it to a much earlier period 
<pb n="510"/>
than this: it is mentioned in the early 
ninth century Nihon ryoiki (Miraculous 
Stories from the Japanese Buddhist 
Tradition) and in the late tenth-century
 Nihon ojo gokur'aku ki (Japanese 
Records of Birth into Paradise). The 
Chiko mandala also figures in other 
records and in collections of folk tales
 and legends, such as the late eleventh-
century Konjaku monogatari (Stories 
Ancient and Modern) in which it is 
related that this mandala was hung in 
the Paradise Hall of the Gango-ji in 
Nara -- the traditional residence of the
 monk Chiko -- whenever there was a 
gathering to chant the nembutsu. 
The story of this mandala is as follows.
 The monks Chiko and Raiko of Gango-ji 
shared a room in which they had 
Practiced religious austerities from the
 time of their youth. At one year's end,
 Raiko ceased speaking, never replying 
to any of Chiko's questions. Several 
years later, Raiko died. Worried about 
Raiko's future existence Chiko prayed 
that he might learn what had happened to
 his friend. One night in a dream he met
 Raiko. The setting was an ethereal, 
splendid place, and when Chiko asked 
where they were, Raiko replied that it 
<pb n="511"/>
was the Pure Land. He went on to explain
 that from his earliest days he had 
studied the sutras and holy scriptures 
and had longed for birth in Paradise, 
knowing all the while that this was no 
easy feat to achieve. He had stopped 
talking in order to focus his inner 
vision exclusively on the countenance of
 Amida and on the magnificence of the 
Pure Land. As a result, he had finally 
attained birth in Paradise. But, 
continued Raiko, Chiko was still 
disordered in mind and body and his good
 deeds were few. Since it seemed 
impossible for him to be born there as 
well, he should return home straightaway
. Chiko began to lament, begging to know
 how it might be possible for someone 
like him to achieve birth in the Western
 Paradise, whereupon Raiko, replying 
that Ohiko should ask that question of 
the Buddha himself, guided Chiko to 
Amida. Amida told Chiko that it was 
necessary to devote one's full attention
 to an inner visualization of the 
extraordinary excellencies of the '
Buddha (Amida) and the sublimity of the 
Pure Land in order to attain birth there
. When Chiko confessed that he could not
 hold in his mind's eye the mysterious 
<pb n="512"/>
and limitless vision of the Western 
Paradise-that this was a feat beyond the
 capabilities of ordinary men-Amida held
 out his right hand and revealed a 
miniture Paradise in his palm. 
Immediately upon waking from the dream, 
Chiko went to an artist and had him 
paint the vision of the Pure Land as it 
had appeared in the dream. The monk 
devoted the rest of his life to a 
contemplation of this mandala and 
finally achieved rebirth in the Western 
Paradise." 



<xa>CHINA</xa>
<_-xa>T'ang Dynasty (Buddhism in the)</_-xa>; <_-xa>Pure Land Buddhism (summary)</_-xa>; <_-xa>Zen School</_-xa>

"Buddhism was introduced into China in A
.D. 67 by two Indian Bhikkhus, Kasyapa 
Matango and Dharmaraksha; the White 
Horse Monastery that was built to 
accommodate them exists today. It made 
rapid progress, eventually becoming one 
of the 'tripod' of religions with Taoism
 and Confucianism. Many schools of 
Buddhist thought developed and 
flourished. The two predominant schools 
were the Ch'an (Jpn./ Zen) and Pure Land
<pb n="513"/>
." 
"When Buddhism spread to China (around 
the first century A.D.), it evolved, 
through the teachings of the Patriarchs,
 into ten schools. Among them are two 
schools which belong to the Southern (
Theravada) tradition, the Satysiddhi 
School and the Abhidharma School. 
However, the faculties and temperament 
of the Chinese people did not correspond
 to the Southern tradition, and, 
therefore, within a short period of time
 it faded away. The other eight schools,
 are all Mahayana: the T'ien T'ai (
Tendai) School, the Avatamsaka School, 
the Madyamika (Three Treatises) School, 
the Mind-Only (Yogacara) School, the 
Vinaya (Discipline) School, the Zen 
School, the Esoteric School and the Pure
 Land School. The vehicle for 
popularizing the Pure Land School is the
 Buddha Recitation method."

"The worship of Amitabha was introduced 
into China at an early period and 
Chinese tradition credits a Parthian 
prince, AnShih-Kao, with having preached
 the doctrine and translated the 
Sukhavativyuha (Amitabha Sutra) about 
the middle of the first century A.D. It 
<pb n="514"/>
was Hui-yuan (333-418), however, who is 
generally regarded as having made of the
 doctrine a separate school. This proved
 most successful and produced several 
renowned scholars of whom Shan-tao (
Zendo) was the most celebrated. He is 
regarded in Japan as an incarnation of 
Amida himself and his works are 
considered sacred texts. By about the 
ninth century, the worship of Amitabha 
had become so popular in China that it 
ceased to be the tenet of any particular
 school and became instead an aspect of 
all schools. The explanation seems to be
 that the doctrine of salvation by faith
 was so easy that no (school) could 
afford to neglect it."
(Encyclopedia of Buddhism, V. I: p.436)
"Buddhism brought to the Chinese a vivid
 concept of an after-life, and a 
doctrine of future punishment for sins 
committed in this life, an idea that 
present sufferings are the result of 
past sins. It taught that future 
retribution for sin could be avoided by 
accumulation of merit by such means as 
chanting liturgies, repentance, 
meritorious actions, asceticism and the 
like. It introduced a soteriology (
doctrine of salvation) by its doctrine 
<pb n="515"/>
of transferred merit. Buddhas and 
Bodhisattvas had accumulated infinite 
stores of merit; by appealing to them in
 penitence and faith, the consequences 
of sin could be wiped out and a blissful
 future life guaranteed. These Buddhist 
ideas exercised a profound influence on 
Confucians and Taoists alike, and on 
popular beliefs." 
"The great contribution which the 
Buddhist Order makes to the life of 
China consists in keeping before the 
minds and imaginations of the people the
 fact of religion, the reality of the 
spiritual life. Doubtless this great 
function of keeping the lamp of religion
 alight is (sometimes not well) 
performed by the Buddhist clergy. But as
 things actually are in China today, and
 have been for many a century, the 
clergy are the torch-bearers of religion
, and if they should drop their light, 
it might well be extinguished in the 
darkness of worldly, unspiritual 
preoccupation. It is not without value 
in the life of the Chinese people that 
they should be constantly reminded of 
the fact of Buddhism, reminded of it as 
at least an unfailing potentiality. It 
is not without value that an Order of 
<pb n="516"/>
men and women should be consecrated to 
the lifelong study and service of 
religion, that buildings of ancient 
beauty should be devoted to the praises 
of the highest ideal that China knows, 
that quiet cloisters should be set aside
 for meditation of holy men and of all 
who wish to meditate. It is not without 
value that the poorest beggar, the 
busiest politician, the saddest woman, 
the most guilty sinner should carry ever
 in the subconscious regions of their 
minds the thought that, if they will, 
they may go any morning or any night to 
a nearby temple, hear the solemn music 
of gong and drum and chanting monks, 
watch the smoke of incense ascend before
 the image of the Blessed One, and catch
 some intimation of a higher life, a 
loftier world, a deeper peace than they 
have known before." 
NOTE
"In Japan, the ancient schools of 
Buddhism (Tendai, Avatamsaka, Zen, Pure 
Land ...) grew more and more into 
independent sects with their own 
organization and separate lay following.
 It is important not to read this 
Japanese development back into the 
classical Chinese situation. The ancient
<pb n="517"/>
 Chinese schools were much less 
institutionalized sectarian entities 
than their successors in Japan. In China
 there arose a movement towards 
syncretism which tended to unite the 
Buddhist sects and in some cases sought 
to harmonize the teachings of Buddhism 
with those of, Taoism and Confucianism. 
This led to a much more integrated and 
united form of Buddhism. Japanese 
writers tend to view this as 
degeneration, but it can also be viewed 
as a successful victory for ecumenism...

Also known as Lien Ch'ih and Yun-ch'i 
Chu-Hung. "Important Chinese monk of the
 Ming Dynasty who developed a practical 
path based on a combination of Zen and 
Pure Land and initiated a strong 
Buddhist lay movement. He first entered 
the monastic order at the age of thirty-
two and became a student of noted 
masters of various schools. He spent 
most of his life in the neighborhood of 
Hang-chou, where he built the Yun-chi 
Temple. In this monastery particular 
emphasis was laid on strict observance 
of the rules of the Vinaya. Through this
<pb n="519"/>
, Chu-hung wished to purify the sangha. 
His effort to link the practice of the 
Pure Land school with that of Zen was 
based on his conviction that, although 
externally the followers of each school 
travel different paths, their inner 
attitude is the same. The recitation of 
Buddha's name, which banishes everything
 from the mind but the name of Amitabha,
 invokes the same state of mind as 
meditating on a koan Zen. Under Chu-hung
's influence many lay followers began 
intensively to practice the recitation 
of Buddha's name and strictly to observe
 the rules of discipline without 
formally entering the monastic order." 
"From as early as the Tang period we 
hear of the existence of 'Pure Land 
Cloisters' within larger monastic 
complexes, where a congregation of self-
professed Pure Land mendicants could 
pursue a collective regimen of Pure Land
 Practice and study. Over the centuries 
that followed, influential Pure Land 
masters have periodically sought to 
organize individual monasteries along 
Pure Land lines ... The Ming dynasty 
master Chu Hung (1535-1615) and 
Republican period master Yin Kuang (1861

<pb n="520"/>
have had a profound impact on the

comprehensive plans for adapting 
traditional monastic structures and 
routines to the specific purposes of 
Pure Land devotion, including the 
creation of halls for the concentrated 
recitation of the Buddha's name that 
were modeled on the traditional Chan 
meditation hall. At the same time, monks
 and nuns of the Pure Land school have 
developed a number of distinctive forms 
of retreat that are organized along the 
lines of the seven-day rite of Buddha-
mindfulness (Seven-Day Retreat/q.v.) but
 apply its program to a more intensive

"Compassion, active sympathy. The

without distinction to all sentient 
beings. It is based on the enlightened 
experience of the oneness of all beings.
 Compassion (Karuna) must be accompanied
 by wisdom (prajna) in order to have the
 right effect. The virtue of compassion 
is 'embodied in the Bodhisattva : 
Avalokiteshvara."

"Sympathy for people who suffer, and the
 will to end their sufferings. Mahayana 
Buddhism greatly emphasized compassion, 
along with wisdom. These two form the 
outstanding Mahayana virtues, sometimes 
called the 'two-in-one' (compassion 
wisdom). The infinite compassion of the 
Buddhas and Bodhisattvas is reflected in
 their constant attempt to succor 
sentient beings."

40.) 
I. How to develop compassion
"In the Buddha-Dharma, there are many 
meditation methods for helping to 
cultivate equanimity and compassion. One
 method, taught by the Buddha directly 
is that every being--whether animal, 
spirit, friend, or enemy -- has been 
your own mother at some point in the 
cycle of rebirth. In our Western society
, we don't always have a respectful 
relationship towards our mother. I don't
 really know why, but people often 
harbor a lot of resentment towards their
 mothers. In Asian cultures, people 
understand that without a mother, we 
wouldn't exist as we do now. Whether she
 has been angry or loving, hurtful, or 
helpful, she gave us a human body, which
 is an incomparable gift. So there is an
 appreciation for archetypical 
motherhood and a respect for the dignity
 of the mother who has given birth to us
. When we consider that everybody has 
<pb n="526"/>
been our mother, the concept is immense.
 It is illuminating when we begin seeing
 the lady at the bank, our children's 
preschool teacher, our friends, our 
workers, our employers, and people in 
other countries as our mother. Everyone 
we see was once the most important 
person in our existence. Then we realize
 that all these beings now only want to 
be happy, yet they don't quite know how 
to do it. In fact, most are constantly 
complicating their conditions--creating 
worse and worse karmic conditions for 
themselves by hatred, greed, ignorance, 
pride, and jealousy. This way we develop
 compassion and a real aspiration to 
liberate them from pain and suffering in
 an ultimate way."

"The ideal of the Bodhisattva 
illustrates the Mahayana Buddhist 
principle that Ultimate Reality is 
itself all-embracing, inclusive of every
 living being and of the nature of 
compassion. One who truly understands 
this principle cannot help but feel 
suffering as long as there is even one 
individual who suffers, for that 
unfortunate individual is one's very 
self." 
<pb n="527"/>

"In the psycho-ethical social philosophy
 of Buddhism, this concept of compassion
 has two main aspects. First, as a 
desirable quality in human character, it
 is meant to regulate our attitude to 
other people. Secondly, it has its 
transcendental aspect known as great or 
grand compassion (maha-karuna) found 
only in sages like Buddhas, (
Bodhisattvas) and Arhats. It is the 
higher kind and is super-individual in 
scope and covers all beings in their 
entirety. It 'seeketh not its own' and 
hence is the result of coming into 
contact with spiritual reality. Cleansed
 of individualised exclusiveness, it 
becomes unlimited .. If compassion is 
the desire to relieve the suffering of 
others, the best way to do so is to lead
 them to the freedom of Buddhahood and 
hence it is this kind of compassion that
 makes the concept truly meaningful."

"It is recorded in the 
Mahabhinishkramana that Devadatta, the 
cousin of Prince Siddhartha, took a bow 
and arrow and shot down a swan. The

creature was grounded but not killed. 
The future Buddha took the bird upon his
 knees and comforted it. Devadatta was 
sent to claim his prize, no doubt 
intending to kill it, but the Buddha 
refused to hand over the swan, saying 
that the bird was his. An exquisite 
description of the incident is to be 
found in The Light of Asia by Sir Edwin 
Arnold: 
'Then our Lord Laid the swan's neck

"The term 'consciousness' (vijnana) 
refers to the perception or discernment 
which occurs when our sense organs make 
contact with their respective objects. 
They are: i. sight consciousness; ii. 
hearing consciousness; iii. scent 
consciousness; iv. taste consciousness; 
v. touch consciousness; vi. mind 
consciousness (Mano consciousness/ Vn/ Y
-Thuc); vii. klistamano consciousness (
defiled mind/ Vn/ Y-Can) and viii. Alaya
 consciousness. The first five 
consciousnesses correspond to the five 
senses. The sixth consciousness '
integrates the perceptions of the five 
senses into coherent images and makes 
judgements about the external world." 
"The seventh consciousness is the active
 center of reasoning, calculation, and 
construction or fabrication of 
individual objects. It is the source of 
clinging and craving, and thus the 
origin of the sense of self or ego and 
the cause of all illusion that arises 
from assuming the apparent to be real (

<xa>COSMIC</xa>
<_-xa>Cosmology</_-xa>; <_-xa>Five 
Corruptions</_-xa>; <_-xa>Auspicious Kalpa
</_-xa>

"In (Buddhist) cosmology, the world goes
 through cycles of cosmic ages, usually 
from a time of generation and harmony to
 a time of decay and conflict. Cosmic 
<pb n="533"/>
ages at the end of a cycle are usually 
corrupt and evil times. The time of the 
Five Corruptions is the last part of one
 such cycle, sometimes called the evil 
cosmic age or the evil end of a cosmic 
age. The cosmic age in which Shakyamuni 
appeared in this world (our cosmic age) 
is regarded as evil because many things 
are corrupted or corrupting: the views 
held by living beings, the afflictions 
that oppress them, living beings 
themselves, and their life-span (see 
Five Corruptions). Some texts, however, 
call the present cosmic age the 
Auspicious Kalpa {Cosmic Age), because a
 number of Buddhas have appeared or will
 appear in our world system during this 
period." 
NOTE: 
The references to a cosmic age as both 
evil and auspicious may appear 
contradictory, but they are not so in 
reality, because the Buddhas' teaching 
is audience-specific. For example, a 
patient with a low temperature will be 
given a medicine to raise his 
temperature, but then if a few minutes 
later his temperature is too high, he 
will be given another medicine to lower 
it. Thus, two medicines with 
<pb n="534"/>
diametrically opposite action are 
administered to the same patient, but 
each is effective because each is 
directed toward a different stage of the
 same disease.

"A number of cosmological schemata are 
present in Buddhism. Possibly the 
earliest of these emerges from the Pali 
Canon, in which the universe is divided 
into three realms, the 'Realm of Desire,
' 'Realm of Forms' and 'Formless Realms.
' Hell beings, hungry ghosts, animals, 
men, anti-gods (Asuras), and six classes
 of gods dwell in the first Realm (
desire). In the second Realm (forms) 
dwell gods who have practiced certain 
dhyanas or meditations. In the third 
realm (formless) dwell those beings who 
have attained the four stages of 
formlessness. A variation on this 
pattern can be found in Vasubandhu's 
<pb n="535"/>
famous Abhidharmakosa. In this framework
, the earth sits atop six cold and six 
hot hells. A huge mountain called Sumeru
 is located in the center of the earth, 
circumscribed by four continents. An 
enormous mountain range surrounds the 
entire system, thus maintaining the 
oceans in their integrity. Above the 
world, gods and other heavenly beings 
dwell in two categories of heavens: 
Desire Heavens and Form Heavens.
"According to the Theravada treatise 
Abhidharma-kosabhasya, at the end of the
 Kalpa (eon) of Destruction, all beings,
 except those whose root of merits is 
destroyed, are reborn in the Abhasvara 
heaven, the second meditation (dhyana) 
heaven, where they will reside 
throughout the duration of the kalpa of 
emptiness. Those beings whose root of 
merit is destroyed are reborn in the 
hells of other universes. When the merit
 of the beings in the Abhasvara heaven 
is exhausted, they descend to be reborn 
as men. They still have all the 
characteristics of the radiant gods of 
the Abhasvara heaven: they are made of 
mind, feed on joy, radiate light, 
traverse the air, and continue in glory.
 Gradually, the earth appears as a kind 
<pb n="536"/>
of foam on the surface of the primeval 
waters. It is a savory earth (ti-wei; 
prthivirasa), which tastes as sweet as 
honey. One being of greedy disposition 
smells its fragrance and eats of it; 
other beings follow suit. With the 
eating of the savory earth, their bodies
 become grosser and heavy, and their 
radiance disappears. Thus are born the 
sun, moon, and stars. As the savory 
earth disappears with beings' attachment
 to it, earth cakes (ti-ping; 
prthiviparpataka) appear. As beings 
become attached to their taste, they too
 begin to disappear, and forest creepers
 (lin-t'eng, vanalata) appear in their 
stead. These also disappear with beings'
 attachment to them, and rice/wheat 
spontaneously begins to grow. Being a 
still grosser form of food, when beings 
eat this grain, some of it remains 
undigested and their bodies produce 
wastes. It is at this juncture in the 
process of materialization that beings 
first become differentiated sexually. 
One being of a lazy nature begins to 
store up rice for future consumption, 
and others, fearing that there will not 
be enough to go around, follow his 
example, With this, the rice begins to 
<pb n="537"/>
disappear and cultivation becomes 
necessary. The people then divide the 
land up into fields, but since some 
steal rice from others' fields, they 
elect a ruler to protect the fields. 
Thus the process of social 
differentiation begins."

"Buddhist texts convey immeasurable 
dimensions of time and space without 
lapsing into abstract terminology. In 
the Buddhist view of the universe one 
thousand solar systems make up what is 
called one small universe, one thousand 
small universes comprise one middle 
universe, and one thousand middle 
universes make one -and only one -- 
large universe. In Buddhist cosmology, 
time, too, is seen as boundless, but 
again we are given 'handles,' through 
vivid and concrete descriptions, by 
which to grasp in some measure this 
infinitude. Thus a kalpa, or world cycle
 of time, is described as the time it 
would take one to empty a huge bowl of 
poppy seeds, forty cubic miles in size, 
by taking out just one poppy seed every 
three years."

Pure Land Buddhism.
<pb n="538"/>
In the Buddhist cosmology, the human and
 celestial realms are among the many 
realms subject to Birth and Death. Above
 these realms are those of the Arhats, 
Pratyeka Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and 
Buddhas. The Pure Lands, the most 
representative of which is the Land of 
Bliss of Amitabha Buddha, are expedient 
realms of the Buddhas and as such are 
beyond Birth and Death. To be reborn 
there is therefore to have transcended 
birth and death.

the concept of kalpa under Kalpa; Cosmic

upon themselves" 
"Listen, for example, to the following 
from Asanga: 'If another does harm to 
the Bodhisattva, the latter endures with
 patience the worst injuries, with the 
idea that it is a benefit he has 
received. To think that the offender 
does one a service, this is to conduct 
oneself in accord with the example of 
the Perfect Ones, i.e., the Buddhas.'" (

"The passage into the next life at the 
moment of death is a nearly impenetrable
 mystery for us who have not yet 
experienced it. There are published 
accounts of near-death experiences by 
people who have been resuscitated from 
clinical death ... the religions of the 
world are nearly unanimous in describing
<pb n="547"/>
 (an uncomfortable event): The 
individual undergoes a judgment where he
 must review his life with unsparing 
honesty. Yet even at that crucial moment
 the dying person may, by focusing his 
mind on (a transcendental being) and 
accepting the Light that seems to 
embrace him, leap to a higher realm." (
World Scripture) 
"According to Buddhism, the death of any
 living being is inherent in its nature 
as a compounded entity: it is the 
dissociation of the constituent elements
 of a being. 'For the born there is no 
such thing as not dying'. Death is thus 
a natural function of the ongoing 
process of life. For just as a birth 
leads inevitably to a death, so a death 
leads inevitably to a birth. Of the five
 Skandhas, the most important is 
consciousness. At the death of an 
individual, these five skandhas contract
, so to speak, to a zero-point; the 
momentum of life itself, however, 
carries the constituent elements on 
beyond this zero-point, to open out into
 new life; thus consciousness becomes 
associated with another form, another 
series of feelings, perceptions, etc." 
(I) Rebirth in Pure Land
<pb n="548"/>
"In literary and oral Buddhist lore, it 
is commonly believed that the last 
thoughts of a dying person have a direct
 influence on the status of rebirth in 
the next life. While this may seem a 
fairly straightforward matter of self-
control -- just 'think good thoughts' --
 it is complicated by the belief that, 
with the waning of one's conscious 
powers, the mind is overwhelmed by 
subliminal karmic propensities or '
memories' that manifest themselves as 
visions before the dying person. In this
 way, the habits and events of one's 
current and previous existences quite 
literally draw one towards one's future 
destiny. As frightful and unpredictable 
as it might seem, this liminal moment of
 transition between death and rebirth is
 considered a time of enormous spiritual
 potential. For at no other time (except
, perhaps, upon attaining the knowledge 
of former lives that comes to 
accomplished meditation masters) is a 
person afforded such a chance to remove 
the veil between the conscious and 
unconscious dimensions of self, review 
directly his or her karmic stock, and 
refashion one's being. Master Shan Tao's
 rites for a dying person, as well as 
<pb n="549"/>
the diverse repertoire of funerary 
ceremonies that are performed for the 
deceased over the forty-nine days 
following death, revolve around a common
 belief in the potency of this moment. 
The primary aim of Shan Tao's deathbed 
procedures is to ensure that the dying 
person successfully forges what is known
 as, 'the connection or nexus of 
conditions that will bring rebirth in 
the Pure Land' ... The successful 
forging of this 'connection with the 
Pure Land' is indicated by the 
appearance of the desired auspicious 
signs at the time of the person's death 
or, as the case may be, during the weeks
 of funerary observances that follow. 
Precedents for such a concept can be 
found in the Pure Land sutras themselves
. The Meditation Sutra, for example, 
distinguishes various visionary things 
that will confirm for the dying person 
that he or she is destined for the Pure 
Land. Having set this prognostic tone, 
the 'ten moments of recollection (10 
recitations) of Amitabha' are described 
as the only effective means for turning 
the situation around should less 
desirable omens appear and salvation be 
in doubt." 
<pb n="550"/>
"Compared to the more difficult 
visualization, oral recitation is more 
accessible to the faithful. The 
Meditation Sutra offers recitation to 
spiritually limited beings on their 
deathbed. For instance, beings in the 
lowest of the nine grades of birth, who 
commited the Five Grave Offenses and the
 Ten Transgressions, cannot be mindful 
of the Buddha as instructed by even a 
virtuous teacher. But if they follow 
their teacher's exhortation to recite (
on their deathbed) with sincere mind the
 name of Buddha Amitabha, they thereby 
eradicate their karmic retribution and 
are assured of rebirth. Recitation 
brings with it the eradication of karmic
 retribution. The prototype of 
recitation occurs in early Buddhist 
scriptures and invariably exemplifies a 
magical nature that often wards away 
imminent dangers. In the Mahavastu, for 
example, 500 merchants in a boat were 
about to be devoured by a giant fish but
 were saved when collectively they 
recited aloud with one pointedness of 
mind: 'We take refuge in the Buddha.'"

"Among some Pure Land Practicers, great 
attention is given to ways of attending 
<pb n="551"/>
the dying so that the mind will remain 
focused on Amida and they will be 
capable of utterance of the nembutsu (
Buddha Recitation) to the very end. For 
example, an image of Amida is often 
placed before dying people and strings 
leading from it are attached to their 
hands. At the same time, nembutsu (
Buddha Recitation) practice throughout 
life is considered useful for 
maintaining such mindfulness at death. (
See Patriarch Honen's death under 'Honen
')" 
"Also several like-minded companions 
should join together in an agreement so 
that when the end of life (of one of the
 companions) approaches, they will take 
turns until dawn reciting the name of 
the Buddha Amitabha and wish for the 
rebirth (of the dying companion) in 
Sukhavati. Voice follows upon voice 
until (one pointedness of mind) is 
accomplished." 
"Pure Land literature offers many 
stories presented as real life 
biographical accounts which corroborate 
the description of the Pure Land 
paradise drawn from the scriptures ... 
The stories often relate people's early 
experience of Buddhism, and note the 
<pb n="552"/>
various practices they took up and the 
scriptures they studied. In due time, 
their faith in Pure Land is awakened, 
perhaps by meeting an inspirational 
teacher, perhaps through a dream or 
vision, perhaps from hearing the Pure 
Land scriptures ... The climax of a Pure
 Land biography comes in the subject's 
death scene, when Buddha-name recitation
 is rewarded and the Pure Land teachings
 are confirmed. The believer dies 
peacefully, even joyously, with mind and
 body composed, in full confidence of 
rebirth in paradise, reciting the Buddha
's name. (J.C. Cleary, Pure Land, Pure 
Mind)" 
"There is even a place in the Western 
Paradise for the worst sinners. The 
Meditation Sutra relates that even if a 
person has committed the five or ten 
cardinal sins, if this sinner earnestly 
recites Amitabha's name ten times on his
 deathbed, a lotus throne will appear 
and will bear him to the lowest stage in
 the Pure Land -- the lowest birth of 
the lowest degree. Instead of being 
condemned to eighty million kalpas in 
hell, the sinner will be born in the 
Western Paradise in a closed lotus Power
; after a period of six kalpas the lotus
<pb n="553"/>
 throne will open and release him. This 
teaching of the nine possible levels of 
birth was an extremely effective way to 
reward good deeds on earth while still 
offering the promise of salvation to all
, regardless of how much merit they had 
accumulated." (Joji Okazaki, Pure Land 
Buddhist Painting. 52) 
(II) Dedication of merits to the dead 
To be truly effective in dedicating 
merit to others, the practitioner must 
be utterly sincere and singleminded in 
his recitation. Even so, the Ksitigarbha
 Sutra teaches that the deceased can 
only receive a small part of this merit.
 Furthermore, since the crucial 
conditions of sincerity and single-
mindedness are seldom achieved in full, 
most intercessions are, at best, 
partially effective and can seldom erase
 a lifetime of bad karma. Thus, it is 
imperative for the practitioner himself 
to cultivate during his lifetime and not
 rely on family members, monks or nuns 
at the time of death. See "Right 
Thoughts" 
(III) Three Doubts / Four Narrow Passes
"Elder Master Tzu Chao once said: The 
Pure Land practitioner on the verge of 
death usually faces Three Points of 
<pb n="554"/>
Doubt and Four Narrow Passes which 
obstruct his rebirth in the Pure Land. 
He should be prepared, reflecting on 
them in advance to eliminate them.
(A) The Three Points of Doubt are:
1) Fearing that his past karma is heavy 
and his period of cultivation short, and
 that therefore, he may not achieve 
rebirth in the Pure Land;
2) Fearing that he has not yet fulfilled
 his vows and obligations or severed 
greed, anger and delusion, and that 
therefore, he may not achieve rebirth in
 the Pure Land;
3) Fearing that even though he has 
recited the Buddha's name, Buddha 
Amitabha may not come, and that 
therefore, he may not achieve rebirth in
 the Pure Land.
(B) The (main) Narrow Passes are:
1) Because of suffering due to illness, 
he may come to malign the Buddhas as 
ineffective and unresponsive;
2) Because of love-attachment, he may 
chain himself to his family, unable to 
let go.
Once aware of the doctrine of the Three 
Doubts and the Four Narrow Passes, the 
wise can ponder and find a solution. The
 author shall merely summarize a few 
<pb n="555"/>
points below. Fellow cultivators can 
expand on them according to their own 
backgrounds and understanding. 
(A) Overcoming the Three Doubts 
(1) Previous heavy karma, present 
perfunctory practice. Amitabha Buddha is
 renowned for his Eighteenth Vow: not to
 attain Buddhahood unless sentient 
beings who sincerely desire to be reborn
 in the Pure Land, and who 
singlemindedly recite His name, are 
reborn there. The Buddhas do not engage 
in false speech, and therefore the 
practitioner should believe in them. Ten
 utterances or thoughts represent a very
 short cultivation period, yet the 
practitioner can still achieve rebirth 
in the Pure Land. We who have recited 
the Buddha's name many times over should
, therefore, eliminate all doubts. 
Moreover, no matter how heavy the karma 
of sentient beings is, if they sincerely
 repent and rely upon Amitabha Buddha, 
they will all be welcomed and guided 
back to the Pure Land. Do we not recall 
that the Meditation Sutra teaches: If 
anyone who has committed the Five Grave 
Offenses or Ten Evil Deeds sees an evil 
omen appear as he is on the verge of 
death, he need only recite the Buddha's 
<pb n="556"/>
name one to ten times singlemindedly, 
and Buddha Amitabha will descend to 
welcome and escort him back to the Pure 
Land. In the commentary Accounts of 
Rebirth, there are cases of individuals 
who throughout their lives were breaking
 the precepts and engaging in all manner
 of evil conduct. Nevertheless, on their
 deathbeds, when the 'marks of hell' 
appeared and, desperate, they 
singlemindedly recited the Buddha's name
, they immediately saw Amitabha Buddha 
arriving to welcome them. Why should we,
 who are not that sinful or deluded, 
worry about not achieving rebirth in the
 Pure Land? 
(2) Unfulfilled vows; non-severance of 
greed, anger and delusion. Cultivators' 
vows can be divided into two categories:
 religious and mundane. Religious vows: 
Some practitioners have vowed to build a
 temple, practice charity or recite 
various sutras or mantras a certain 
number of times, etc. However, they have
 not completely fulfilled their vows 
when it is time for them to die.  These 
cultivators should think: reciting the 
Buddha's name singlemindedly will earn 
them rebirth in the pure Land, where 
they will have ample opportunity to 
<pb n="557"/>
achieve immeasurable merits and virtues.
 Their present vows to build temples and
 recite sutras are merely secondary 
matters. The fact that they may not have
 fulfilled them should be of no great 
concern. Mundane vows: These include 
family obligations such as caring for 
sick, ageing parents or helpless wives 
and young children, as well as business 
debts to be paid or certain other 
commitments to be fulfilled. Faced with 
these worries, the practioners should 
think: on our deathbed, there is nothing
 that can be done, whether we worry or 
not. It is better to concentrate on 
Buddha Recitation. Once we are reborn in
 the Pure Land and Buddhahood is 
achieved, all vows, wishes and debts can
 be taken care of, as we will be in a 
position to rescue everyone, family and 
foes alike. The Questions of King 
Milinda Sutra contains the following 
parable: A minute grain of sand, dropped
 on the surface of the water, will sink 
immediately. On the other hand, a block 
of stone, however large and heavy, can 
easily be moved from place to place by 
boat. The same is true of the Pure Land 
practitioner. However light his karma 
may be, if he is not rescued by Amitabha
<pb n="558"/>
 Buddha, he must revolve in the cycle of
 Birth and Death. With the help of 
Amitabha Buddha, his karma, however 
heavy, will not prevent his rebirth in 
the Pure Land. We can see from this 
passage that thanks to 'other-power,' 
the Pure Land method can benefit the 
practitioner, however heavy his karma 
may be. The huge block of stone 
represents the weight of heavy karma, 
the boat symbolizes the power of 
Amitabha Buddha's Vows. Therefore, the 
cultivator should not think that 
residual greed, anger and delusion will 
prevent him from achieving rebirth in 
the Pure Land. This example should also 
resolve doubts concerning past heavy 
karma, as in doubt number one above.
(3) Despite recitation, Amitabha Buddha 
may not come, after all. At the time of 
death, the Pure Land practitioner will 
see, depending on his virtues, Amitabha 
Buddha, the Bodhisattvas or the Ocean-
Wide Assembly come to welcome him. 
Sometimes he may not see anything, but, 
thanks to the power of his vows and the 
'gathering in' power of Amitabha Buddha,
 he will be reborn in the Pure Land all 
the same. The difference lies in his 
level of cultivation, whether subtle or 
<pb n="559"/>
gross, transcendental or mundane. What 
is most important at the time of death 
is to recite the Buddha's name in all 
earnestness and not worry about anything
 else. Any doubts at that time will give
 rise to obstructions and impediments. 
In summary, at the time of death, the 
practitioner should not be concerned 
about whether or not he witnesses 
auspicious signs. He should just 
concentrate on reciting the Buddha's 
name in all earnestness until the very 
end.
(B) Overcoming the Narrow Passes These '
passes' can be described as follows:
- Slandering the Buddhas because of 
suffering and disease;
- Binding and chaining oneself to family
 and friends through love-attachment. 
l. Sincere practitioners who meet with 
accidents, disease and disaster should 
reflect that these are sometimes due to 
virtues accrued through cultivation. 
Either the heavy karma (which he should 
have endured) has been commuted to light
 karma (which he is now enduring), or 
else, future karma has been transformed 
into current karma, giving him the 
opportunity to repay karmic debts before
 achieving rebirth in the Pure Land. 
<pb n="560"/>
Should he doubt this and speak ill of 
the Dharma, he would lack faith and 
understanding, display ingratitude 
toward the Buddhas and bring evil karma 
upon himself. Among the rebirth stories,
 we find instances where this 'bunching 
and compressing of karma' has allowed 
cultivators to hasten their rebirth in 
the Pure Land. Therefore, when Pure Land
 cultivators encounter such instances, 
they should be aware and understand them
 thoroughly. Furthermore, this body is 
illusory and provisional. Depending on 
his merit or bad karma, the practitioner
's life will be long or short, happy or 
filled with hardship. He should 
systematically rely on the Buddhas and 
firmly believe in the law of cause and 
effect. When ill or in bad health, the 
practitioner should direct his thoughts 
toward Amitabha Buddha exclusively. He 
should not seek the help of externalist 
gurus, shamans or healers. Nor should he
 listen to those who do not yet 
understand the Dharma and revert to a 
non-vegetarian diet, drink alcoholic 
beverages, etc. Our bodies are truly 
full of filth; the sooner we return to 
the Pure Land, the better. It is like 
casting off a smelly, ragged garment and
<pb n="561"/>
 donning a beautiful, fragrant outfit. 
What is there to worry about? 
2. Concerning the danger of love-
attachment at the time of death, as 
indicated earlier, the practitioner 
should think thus: family members, 
including parents, brothers, sisters, 
husbands, wives and children, are 
temporarily gathered together in this 
life as a result of previous causes and 
conditions, such as karmic debts or love
 and hatred, accumulated from time 
immemorial. When these causes and 
conditions come to an end, we all part 
and go our separate ways. If we truly 
care for them, we should endeavor to be 
reborn in the Pure Land, so as to be 
able to save everyone, friend and foe 
alike. Although we may have attachments 
to family and friends, when death 
approaches, there is nothing we can 
bring along or do, as even our very body
 disintegrates and returns to dust. If 
we harbor thoughts of attachment and 
love, not only will we fail to achieve 
rebirth in the Pure Land, we will not 
escape the endless cycle of Birth and 
Death. The practitioner should ponder 
and clearly recall the Three Doubts and 
Four Narrow Passes to prepare himself. 
<pb n="562"/>
His mind will then be calm and 
undisturbed at the time of death." 
NOTES
(1) Buddhism makes a distinction between
 physical (clinical) death and mental 
death, with the former preceding the 
latter by a period of some three to 
eight hours. Actual death is defined as 
that moment when the Alaya consciousness
 leaves the body -not when the heart has
 stopped or brain waves can no longer be
 detected. This is the reason for the 
waiting period of at least three hours 
after clinical death before the body is 
disturbed. 
(2) "Although the last state of 
consciousness of one 'life' is held to 
be of great importance for the first 
state of consciousness of the ensuing 
one; if it was wholesome, this will 
produce a 'wholesome' inauguration of a 
new life. Similarly, if it was 
unwholesome, the ensuing new life will 
be unwholesomely inaugurated. It is not 
this last state only which determines 
the character of the new life; the whole
 previous life has produced a momentum 
of a wholesome or unwholesome kind, in 
varying degrees, which will inevitably 
have effects upon the ongoing course of 
<pb n="563"/>
life."

<xa>DEATH</xa>
<_-xa>Death</_-xa>; <_-xa>Supportive 
Recitation</_-xa>

"Tibetans' casual attitude toward 
corpses is in marked contrast to their 
attentive behavior at the very hour of 
death and immediately after it has 
occurred. This behavior, quite 
dissimilar to ours in the West, seems to
 objective eyes far more civilized, for 
it is the Western practice to remove a 
body from its deathbed in crude haste, 
almost before it is cold, in order to 
embark immediately on whatever is needed
 to prepare it for public display, or 
cremation. Dehumanized hospital 
regulations permit (little) latitude for
 any possible 'rites of passage' at this
 great moment when life is exchanged for
 death. (Buddhists among them), Tibetans
, on the contrary, pay special attention
 to such rites." 
"When a person has just died, the most 
<pb n="564"/>
important thing is not to rush to move 
him. Even if his body is soiled with 
excrement and urine, we should not 
hasten to clean it. We should wait about
 eight hours -- or a minimum of three 
hours -- before cleaning the body and 
changing its clothes. Relatives should 
not weep and wail immediately before and
 after the actual death. Doing so is not
 only useless, it can be harmful, as 
this can cause the deceased to develop 
thoughts of attachment, which may 
prevent him from achieving liberation. 
To be of true benefit to the patient, we
 should concentrate on reciting the 
Buddha's name in all earnestness, 
without crying until at least eight 
hours have passed. Why is this necessary
? It is because although the patient has
 left his body, if, during this period, 
we move the body, clean it, change its 
clothes, or weep and lament, the 
deceased may still experience feelings 
of pain, sadness, anger or self-pity, 
and descend upon the Evil Paths. This is
 a crucial point -- a critical one -- 
that relatives should note and remember 
well. The practice of touching the body 
of the deceased to locate the last warm 
spot and deduce his place of rebirth is 
<pb n="565"/>
grounded in the sutras and commentaries.
 However, we should not be inflexible. 
If the patient had sincere, earnest 
faith and vows in normal times and 
clearly exhibits right thought at the 
time of death, this is sufficient 
evidence of rebirth in the Pure Land. 
Some persons who are not careful keep '
feeling' the body, touching one spot 
after another, disturbing the deceased. 
This can cause great harm. After the 
patient has expired, the persons who 
came to recite the Buddha's name should 
continue doing so for another three 
hours. After that, the body should be 
left alone, free of all disturbances, 
for another five hours (or a total of 
eight hours), at which time it can be 
bathed and given a change of clothing. 
If, during the entire eight-hour period,
 someone, or a group of persons, can 
remain near the deceased reciting the 
Buddha's name, so much the better. 
Except for recitation, nothing should be
 done. A reminder and caveat: during 
this period, the 'deceased' may still 
have consciousness and feelings. After 
the eight-hour period, if the limbs have
 grown stiff and cannot be moved, we 
should put a towel soaked in hot water 
<pb n="566"/>
around the joints. After a while, the 
body can be repositioned."

<_-xa>Capital Punishment</_-xa>

"Question: What is the Buddhist view on 
the death penalty? 
Answer: Life is the most valuable 
possession any person has, even if that 
person acts in a criminal manner. 
Buddhism recommends rehabilitation or 
imprisonment rather than execution. The 
proper motivation is needed for 
<pb n="568"/>
imprisoning others, however. That is, 
imprisonment is to protect a person from
 harming others and from creating more 
negative karma that would bring him or 
her misery later. Seeking revenge or 
feeling glee at punishing others are 
opposite to the kind heart that Buddhism
 encourages us to develop."

<xa>DEDICATION</xa>
<_-xa>Merit Transference</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Transfer of merit</_-xa>
<_-xa>Other Power</_-xa>; <_-xa>Atonement</_-xa>; <_-xa>Pure Land School</_-xa>

The concept of dedication of merit (
merit transference) is particularly 
important in Mahayana Buddhism, and is 
stressed in the Pure Land School with 
its teaching of Other Power, the power 
of the Buddha Amitabha. 
"The concept of merit transference, or 
sharing one's own merits and virtues 
with others, is reflected in the 
<pb n="569"/>
following passage: 'Some of us may ask 
whether the effect of evil karma can be 
... changed by repeating the name of 
Kuan-Yin (Avalokitesvara). This question
 is tied up with that of rebirth in 
Sukhavati (the Pure Land) and it may be 
answered by saying that the invocation 
of Kuan-Yin's name forms another cause 
which will right away offset the 
previous karma. We know, for example, 
that if there is a dark, heavy cloud 
above, the chances are that it will rain
. But we also know that if a strong wind
 should blow, the cloud will be carried 
away somewhere else and we will not feel
 the rain. Similarly, the addition of 
one big factor can alter the whole 
course of karma ... It is only by 
accepting the idea of life as one whole 
that both Theravadins and Mahayanists 
can advocate the practice of 
transference of merit to others. With 
the case of Kuan-Yin then, by calling on
 Her name we identify ourselves with Her
 and as a result of this identification,
 Her merits flow over to us. These 
merits which are now ours, then 
counterbalance our bad karma and save us
 from calamity. The Law of Cause and 
Effect still stands good. All that has 
<pb n="570"/>
happened is that a powerful and 
immensely good karma has overshadowed 
the weaker one.' (Lecture on Kuan-Yin by
 Tech Eng Soon - Penang Buddhist 
Association, c.1960. Pamphlet.)" 
"If the Buddha's name or a passage from 
the Sutras, is properly repeated and if 
one puts one's mind upon it with deep 
reverence, one will thereby acquire 
merit. The amount of merit thus acquired
 will depend upon the mental state. Mere
 mechanical repetition is (in theory) 
worthless. On the other hand, the 
repetition of almost any text may 
acquire merit if repeated with great 
reverence. The merit thus acquired is 
transferable (a good Mahayana doctrine, 
it will be remembered), though a certain
 amount of it will be lost in the 
process. Pious women often transfer the 
merit they have acquired through vows 
and penances to the members of their 
family. Most frequently it is to the 
dead that merit is transferred." 
"The conception of vicarious suffering 
and the transference of merit is on the 
surface hardly in harmony with what I 
have called the intellectual aspect of 
the Buddha's teaching and his emphasis 
upon self-help. On the other hand, it is
<pb n="571"/>
 the natural, perhaps even the necessary
, outcome of the heart element of 
Buddhism, of the Founder's devotion and 
of the devotion of all loving souls. If 
the great enlightenment is not merely an
 intellectual achievement but a new 
experience of sharing our common life, 
we may perhaps say with Professor D.T. 
Suzuki that the possibility of sharing 
our merit and others' is the 'logical 
outcome of enlightenment consciousness.'
 'What made Buddhism great as a 
universal religion (Suzuki adds) was the
 discovery of this principle. . . . The 
law of Karma may be true and should be 
made to work in our practical and 
intellectual plane of life, but it is 
too rigid, too exclusive, too 
individualistic, and above all, it goes 
against our religious yearnings. We want
 to suffer for others and when this is 
not practicable, we want to send out our
 thoughts and sympathies to them. If we 
are at all spiritual beings capable of 
enlightenment, this thought 
communication or mystical 
interpenetration must be possible.'" (D.
T. Suzuki,"Development of the Pure Land 
Doctrine in Buddhism," Eastern Buddhist,
 III, 311-12.)
<pb n="572"/>
NOTE: 
To be truly effective in dedicating 
merit to others, the practitioner must 
be utterly sincere and singleminded in 
his recitation. Even if he is, the 
Ksitigarbha Sutra teaches that the 
deceased can only receive a small part 
of this merit. Furthermore, since the 
crucial conditions of sincerity and 
single-mindedness are seldom achieved in
 full, most intercessions are, at best, 
partially effective and can seldom erase
 a lifetime of bad karma. Thus, it is 
imperative for the practitioner himself 
to cultivate during his lifetime and not
 rely on family members, monks or nuns 
at the time of death. 



<xa>DEER</xa>
<_-xa>Sarnath，鹿野苑</_-xa>

"The name of a park in Varanasi, India, 
the site of present-day Sarnath. The 
Deer Park was also called Rishi-patana 
or 'the place where hermits gather.' 
Here Shakyamuni delivered his first 
sermon. After his enlightenment under 
the Bodhi tree, the Buddha went to the 
<pb n="573"/>
Deer Park where he expounded the Four 
Noble Truths and converted five ascetics
 including Kaundinya. Hsuantsang's 
Records of the Western Regions explains 
the origin of the name Deer Park: The 
lord of Varanasi once hunted and killed 
many deer on this land. The deer king 
implored him to stop the unnecessary 
killing and promised that each day he 
himself would give the lord the number 
of deer which he required. One day, he 
was faced with the necessity of sending 
a pregnant deer. Rather than sacrifice 
her with her unborn child, the deer king
 went to the lord to offer his own flesh
 instead The lord was so moved by the 
deer king's compassion that he stopped 
the daily killing and gave it the land. 
Hence it was named the Deer Park. 
Varanasi prospered until the Muslim 
invasion in the thirteenth century. Many
 stupas and monasteries were built in 
this area."

<_-xa>Ignorance</_-xa>; <_-xa>Delusions of

"Delusion refers to a belief in 
something that contradicts reality. In 
Buddhism, delusion is a lack of 
awareness of the true nature or Buddha-
nature of things, or of the true meaning
 of existence. According to the Buddhist
 outlook, we are deluded by our senses -
<pb n="575"/>
- among which intellect (discriminating,
 discursive thought) is included as a 
sixth sense. Consciousness, attached to 
a sense, leads us into error by causing 
us to take the world of appearances for 
the world of reality, whereas in fact it
 is only a limited and fleeting aspect 
of reality." (Shambhala Dictionary of 
Buddhism and Zen.)
"(Delusion is) the fundamental error 
which brings about existence. The word 
is used in the common sense of the most 
basic cause in the development of 
discriminations. It is the initial 
perception of either existence or non-
existence when in reality there is 
neither one nor the other. This topic is
 treated at very great length in the 
Surangama Sutra." 
Buddhism of Wisdom ＆ Faith/ excerpts:
"Delusion (ignorance) is the source of 
all afflictions. Greed and anger stem 
from delusion, as do pride, doubts and '
wrong views'. For example, when we have 
such thoughts as: 'I have few equals in 
hard and assiduous cultivation, even 
among the ranks of monks and nuns' -- 
this is the affliction of pride and self
-love. If, on the other hand, we develop
 such thoughts as: 'The Land of Ultimate
<pb n="576"/>
 Bliss is so well-adorned, while I have 
heavy karma and few merits; how do I 
know I will achieve rebirth there?' -- 
this is the affliction of doubt. Wrong 
views consist of seeing and 
understanding in a wicked and grasping 
manner. They include five types: Wrong 
Views of the Body, One-Sided Views, 
Wrong Views Not Consistent with the 
Dharma, Wrong Views Caused by Attachment
 to one's own Erroneous Understanding 
and Wrong Views (understanding) of the 
Precepts. For example, during 
cultivation a thought suddenly arises: '
My health has always been poor, and 
today I feel tired, worn out; if I 
continue to recite the Buddha's name, I 
may fall ill.' This is an example of a 
Wrong View of the Body. Or else, we 
think: 'Death is like a candle which has
 gone out; if there was a previous life,
 how come I cannot remember it? It is 
better for me to follow Taoism, to 
prolong my life and avoid death.' This 
is an instance of a One-Sided View. Or 
else, we wonder why someone who had 
performed only good deeds had a short 
life and met a violent death, while 
others who had committed numerous 
transgressions lived long lives and died
<pb n="577"/>
 peacefully; thus, cultivation brings no
 benefit whatsoever! These are instances
 of Wrong Views Not Consistent with the 
Dharma, and failure to understand that 
the law of cause and effect spans many 
lifetimes. Or else, someone might think,
 'I used to follow the externalist 
practice of circulating energy currents,
 and was achieving results in barely a 
few months. How is it that I have been 
reciting the Buddha's name for a long 
time, but have not yet seen any change?'
 This is an instance of Attachment to 
one's own Erroneous Understandings. Or 
else, we may think: 'In other religions,
 people who hurt and kill other sentient
 beings can still be reborn in paradise;
 therefore, in seeking rebirth in the 
Pure Land, there is no need to keep the 
precept against killing.' This is an 
instance of Wrong View of the Precepts. 
The karma of delusion takes numerous 
forms. The Pure Land practitioner should
, first and foremost, follow the sutras 
and put his entire faith in them. If he 
fails to understand certain passages, he
 should seek out good spiritual advisors
 for an explanation. Delusion can easily
 lead the practitioner astray when he is
 challenged by other teachings and 
<pb n="578"/>
ideologies."

NOTES:
According to Mahayana teaching, there 
are, in total, 52 levels of ignorance (
delusion), in ascending order of 
subtlety. 
"The real problem for Buddhist 
practitioners is... spiritual ignorance,
 which is not just an intellectual 
defect but a lack of understanding of 
reality which can be overcome by 
meditational insight."



<xa>DELUSIONS</xa>
<_-xa>Upside-down living</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Wrong Views</_-xa>

Delusions of Views refer to lust and 
greed for externals (clothing, food, 
sleep, etc.), which are viewed as real 
rather than empty in their true nature. 
Delusions of Thought consist in being 
confused about principles and giving 
rise to discrimination .. Thought 
delusions are unclear, muddled thoughts,
 taking what is wrong as right, and what
 is right as wrong (Master Hsuan Hua). 
<pb n="579"/>
Delusions of Views, simply put, are 
delusions connected with seeing and 
grasping at the gross level. Delusions 
of Thought are afflictions at the subtle
 level. 
NOTE:
"In the Buddhist world view, the 
probability of eliminating all delusions
 of views and thought and escaping Birth
 and Death in one lifetime of 
cultivation is nil. (Apparent exceptions
 are practitioners in the last lifetime 
of cultivation or Bodhisattvas who have 
taken human form to convert sentient 
beings.) After all, even Buddha 
Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism, 
underwent eons of rebirth as exemplified
 in the Jakata Tales. This is also the 
case with Buddha Amitabha and the 
Bodhisattva Maitreya -- the Buddha of 
the future." 
Unless a practitioner has succeeded in 
severing both types of delusions 
completely, he will not be able to 
escape Birth and Death. This is the 
rationale for seeking rebirth in the 
Pure Land, an ideal place to continue 
cultivation until all such delusions are
 severed.

<_-xa>Devil</_-xa>; <_-xa>Hallucinations</_-xa>
<_-xa>Mara</_-xa>; <_-xa>visions</_-xa>; <_-xa>obstacles to cultivation</_-xa>

Evil influences which hinder cultivation
 and impede one's practice and 
liberation. These can take an infinite 
number of forms, including evil beings 
and hallucinations. Disease and death, 
as well as the three poisons of greed, 
anger and delusion, are also equated to 
demons, as they disturb the mind. The 
Nirvana Sutra lists four types of demons
: i) greed, anger and delusion; ii) the 
five skandas, or obstructions caused by 
physical and mental functions, iii) 
death; iv) the demon of the Sixth Heaven
 (Realm of Desire). 
The Self-Nature has been described in 
Mahayana sutras as a house full of gold 
and jewelry. To preserve the riches, i.e
., to keep the mind calm, empty and 
still, we should shut the doors to the 
three thieves of greed, anger and 
delusion. Letting the mind wander opens 
the house to 'demons,' that is, 
hallucinations and harm. Thus, Zen 
practitioners are taught that, while in 
<pb n="581"/>
meditation, 'Encountering demons, kill 
the demons, encountering Buddhas, kill 
the Buddhas.' Both demons and Buddhas 
are mind-made, Mind-Only. For a detailed
 discussion of demons/ hallucination, 
see Master Thich Thien Tam, Buddhism of 
Wisdom and Faith, sect. 51. 
"There are numerous classes of demons 
mentioned in the Buddhist scriptures. 
The personification of evil is usually 
called Mara or the Demon of the Sixth 
Heaven." 



<xa>DEMONS</xa>
<_-xa>Mara</_-xa>; <_-xa>Visions</_-xa>
Buddhism of Wisdom ＆ Faith/ excerpts:

"Ancient masters have said: 'When we see
 demons yet remain undisturbed, the 
demons self destruct; when we see ghosts
 yet remain undisturbed, the ghosts are 
vanquished.' This saying means: if we 
see demons and ghosts but our minds are 
unmoved and unafraid, holding fast to 
correct thoughts or singlemindedly 
reciting the Buddha's name, these demons
 and ghosts cannot hurt us in any way 
and will leave of their own accord. Not 
<pb n="582"/>
only should we act in such a manner when
 seeing demons, but even when we achieve
 some results or see auspicious marks 
during cultivation, we should not be 
moved to astonishment, sadness or joy. 
It is as if we had lost a diamond at the
 bottom of the lake and because the 
water was murky, we were unable to 
recover it despite our best efforts. 
However, once the water became still and
 transparent, we found it. Since the 
diamond had always belonged to us, why 
should we have been astonished happy? If
 the cultivator's mind is not calm and 
peaceful and is overly given to 
sorrowful compassion, he will be harmed 
by the demon of sorrow and cry all the 
time. If he is given to too much 
happiness, he will be harmed by the 
demon of happiness and laugh all the 
time, as though insane. Thus, although 
the Pure Land practitioner may also hope
 to see transcendental realms and scenes
, he should not long for or dream of 
them too much, because to recite is 
already to seek. He should be calm and '
seek, but not seek, not seek but seek,' 
so as to avoid disturbing his mind. He 
should just earnestly recite the Buddha'
s name and in time, when the power of 
<pb n="583"/>
his recitation is pure, there will be a 
response and he will witness auspicious 
realms. To continuously seek and hope 
for them is deluded thought which brings
 harm." 



<xa>DEPENDENT</xa>
<_-xa>Sukhavati，淨土</_-xa>

In the Pure Land tradition, the "main 
rewards" are the exalted features of 
Buddha Amitabha and other superior 
beings in the Land of Bliss, while the "
dependent reward" is the ideal 
environment of the Land itself. The 
concept of main and dependent rewards 
can be found in our everyday life where 
a person with a good karma usually has 
noble features (main rewards) and 
inhabits a safe area free of crime and 
drugs (dependent rewards).
"Dependent and main rewards are based on
 past karmic actions. The 'main rewards'
 refer to living beings, while the '
dependent rewards' refer to the physical
 environment on which the living beings 
'depend,' such as the land ponds, trees,
 and so forth." 
<pb n="584"/>



<xa>DEPENDENT</xa>
<_-xa>Interdependent Origination. 
Dependent causation, dependent 
origination, conditioned co-arising or 
co-production.</_-xa>

(Skt / pratitya-samutpada.)"The central 
principle that phenomena do not come 
into existence on their own but as a 
result of conditions. Nagarjuna 
identifies inter-dependent origination (
pratitya-samutpada) with emptiness (
shunyata)." 
"A fundamental Buddhist doctrine of the 
interdependence of things. It teaches 
that all beings and phenomena exist or 
occur only because of their relationship
 with other beings or phenomena. 
Therefore, nothing can exist in absolute
 independence of other things or arise 
of its own accord. The doctrine of the 
Twelve-Linked Chain of causation is a 
well-known illustration." 
"Since all things in the phenomenal 
world are brought into being by the 
combination of various causes and 
conditions, they are relative and 
<pb n="585"/>
without substantiality or self-entity. 
From the transcendental viewpoint, this 
absence of self-entity is called 
emptiness; from the phenomenal viewpoint
, it is called dependent generation, and
 is the central doctrine of Buddhism 
that denies the existence of any form of
 eternal or substantial being. When 
applied to sentient beings' endless 
lives in Samsara, it becomes the Twelve 
Links of Dependent Origination."

<_-xa>Gods</_-xa>; <_-xa>Celestial</_-xa>; <_-xa>Heavenly being</_-xa>

"A divinity or god; a heavenly being. 
Devas, including Hindu gods, are 
believed to inhabit the heavens above 
the human realm, but are still 
unenlightened, bound to Samsara and 
subject to Birth and Death. Many such 
beings have already been converted to 
Buddhism and become its protectors." 
<pb n="586"/>
"A 'celestial,' one of the inhabitants 
of the heavens. In the Buddhist 
conception of the cosmos, celestials and
 godlings inhabit marvel-filled realms 
on the summit of Mount Sumeru and beyond
. These are utopian places of rest, 
bliss and peaceful abstraction. Living 
beings reborn in one of these blissful 
realms are gods. Any living being can be
 reborn as one of the gods if that 
living being has the required merit and 
virtue."

"One of six miraculous powers. 
Supernatural hearing is the ability to 
hear the sounds of humans and nonhumans,
 distant and near sounds, and so on. The
 degree of this power differs according 
to one's karmic reward or yogic (samadhi
) achievement." 



<pb n="587"/>
<xa>DEVADATTA，提婆達多</xa>
<_-xa>Good Spiritual Advisors</_-xa>

"A cousin of Sakyamuni Buddha and his 
most persistent enemy. According to the 
Pali Canon, he twice tried to kill him, 
as well as attempting to cause schisms 
in the Sangha (community of Monks and 
Nuns)." 
In the Mahayana canon (particularly in 
the Lotus Sutra) Devadatta is considered
 to be a Bodhisattva in disguise who 
through his constant "needling" of the 
Buddha helped the latter perfect his 
Enlightenment. Thus Devadatta is called 
an "adverse-practice" Good Spiritual 
Advisor.



<xa>DEVANAMPIYA</xa>
<_-xa>Sri Lanka (Buddhism in)</_-xa>

"King who ruled Sri Lanka from 247-207 B
.C. and was responsible for the 
introduction of Buddhism to the island. 
Although Devanampiya Tissa already knew 
about Buddhism from King Asoka, his 
first real occasion for receiving 
Buddhist teaching came from Mahinda, 
<pb n="588"/>
Asoka's missionary to Sri Lanka. After 
meeting, quite possibly in Mihintale, 
Mahinda and his associates were invited 
to the capital of Anuradhapura. The king
 offered Mahameghavana Park to the 
Sangha, on the site that eventually 
became the Mahavihara monastery. Within 
a short period, young men from Sri Lanka
 were initiated into the Sangha, thus 
establishing a valid ordination lineage 
on the island. A branch of the Bodhi 
Tree was brought from India, the Vinaya 
was recited, and an order of nuns was 
established. By the end of Devanampiya 
Tissa's reign, Buddhism in Sri Lanka was
 firmly entrenched." 
"The order of nuns essentially died out 
in Sri Lanka in the eleventh century."

"Sometimes it is suggested that the 
emphasis on devotion as providing a 
special kind of salvation is unnatural 
in Buddhism and alien to the earlier 
<pb n="589"/>
tradition. Yet even the earliest form of
 Buddhism known to us taught that faith 
in the Buddha was able both to bring 
about a heavenly rebirth and to set one 
firmly on the path to liberation. The 
difference is in the Mahayana emphasis 
on the 'power of resolve' (other power) 
of a Buddha, which is capable of 
creating enormously favourable 
conditions." 



<xa>DHAMMA</xa>
<_-xa>Dharma</_-xa>



<xa>DHAMMAPADA</xa>
Exists in 2 versions : Theravada and 
Mahayana
"The Path or Way of the Buddha's Dhamma 
or Teaching. The most famous scripture 
in the Pali Canon." 
 (1) "The Dhcimmapada (in its Theravada 
version) came to be written down in the 
first century BC. It is one of the 
fifteen books of the Khuddaka-Nikaya and
 it is made up of some 423 verses 
arranged by topic into 26 chapters. 
<pb n="590"/>
These verses are descriptions of the way
 to live, the life of meditation and the
 practice of reason and intelligence. 
There are many exhortations to cast off 
craving and orient yourself towards 
enlightenment. It is not just a book of 
morality, it seeks to go further than 
that. Luckily the verses are easy to 
read and to memorize, and the many 
translations hava given the Dhammapada 
worldwide popularity, representing for 
Buddhism what the Bhagavad Gita is for 
Hinduism and the Tao Te Ching is for 
Taoism." 
 (2) "In its Mahayana version, a sutra 
consisting of two sections and divided 
into thirty-nine chapters. It was 
translated into Chinese during the Wu 
dynasty (A.D. 222-80). A collection of 
moral teachings, it stresses good 
conduct stabilized by concentration and 
strengthened by perfect Wisdom."/ Yoko: 
202 The Dhammapada was translated into 
Latin in 1855. This is said to have been
 one of the first Buddhist texts to be 
introduced to the West.

<xa>DHARMA/DHAMMA，法</xa>
<_-xa>Buddha Dharma</_-xa>; <_-xa>Dhamma</_-xa>

"The word Dharma has several meanings: a
) The teachings of the Buddhas (
generally capitalized in English); b) 
law, doctrine; c) things, events, 
phenomena." 
"In the centuries that followed the 
Buddha's death, various attempts were 
made to organize and formulate his 
teachings. Different systems appeared, 
basing themselves on the recorded 
scriptures, each purporting to express 
the Buddha's intended meaning... That 
there should be a multiplicity of 
<pb n="592"/>
systems is not in itself surprising. 
From the time of his enlightenment until
 his death fifty years later, the Buddha
 bestowed his teachings for the benefit 
of many different audiences. The purpose
 of his doctrine was always the same: to
 liberate beings from the round of 
suffering. The expression of this 
purpose, however, differed according to 
the capacity of his hearers. It is 
therefore to be expected that the body 
of teachings remaining after his 
departure from the world should be rich 
and varied, containing elements that 
sometimes even contradict each other. 
The Madhyamika deals with this state of 
affairs by saying that statements made 
by the Buddha are of two kinds: absolute
 (nitartha), corresponding to his true 
meaning, as understood by himself, and 
expedient (neyartha), corresponding to a
 partial expression of his meaning, 
geared to the understanding of his 
hearers, intended to lead them along the
 path to perfect comprehension and being
 therefore of provisional validity. 
Parallel with this division is the 
doctrine of the two truths: absolute 
truth (paramartha) corresponding to 
reality, and relative truth (samvriti) 
<pb n="593"/>
corresponding to empirical experience. 
According to Nagarjuna, the Buddha 
skillfully graduated his teaching 
according to pedagogical necessity. He 
affirmed the existence of the atman, the
 self, as against the 'nihilist'. (who 
disbelieves in survival after death), in
 order to maintain the truth of karma 
and ethical responsibility. By contrast,
 he denied the existence of the atman, 
as against the 'eternalist' (who takes 
the self to be a changeless essence). (
In other words,) He said that there is 
neither self nor no-self."

Birds, trees preaching the Dharma:
This can be understood as an allegory, 
similar to the traditional definition of
 a Pratyeka Buddha: a sage who becomes 
enlightened by observing the falling 
leaves and realizing, for example, the 
impermanence of life. In this sense the 
falling leaves can be said to preach the
 Dharma (the Buddha's teachings). The 
image of inanimate objects, such as the 
ground, trees, rain, precious stones, 
etc. expounding the Teachings is found 
throughout such high-level Mahayana 
texts as the Avatamsaka Sutra: "Buddha's
 blessings and mystical powers/ Adorn 
<pb n="594"/>
everywhere with precious gemstones;/ The
 ground and the enlightenment tree/ 
Alternately emit light and sound 
expressing the truth./ Precious lamps, 
infinite, rain from the sky,/ Studded 
with regal sapphires,/ All emitting 
subtle sounds speaking truth ..." (T. 
Cleary, The Flower Ornament Scripture, 
Vol. I, p.139). 
NOTE: The various teachings of the 
Buddha constitute a totality. While it 
is said that the Buddha taught 84,000 
methods in accordance with the capacity 
of his listeners, on another level we 
can also say that individuals receive 
and understand these teachings 
differently. It is like rain which falls
 equally on all vegetation. However, the
 big trees absorb more of the rain water
 than the smaller trees, while a dead 
bush cannot benefit at all. The 
differences between Buddhist schools are
 similar: they are caused by the 
different capacities of Buddhist 
followers and not by the Buddha 
preaching different teachings to 
different audiences. (See the Lotus 
Sutra).

<xa>DHARMA</xa>
<_-xa>Dharma-kaya</_-xa>; <_-xa>Dharmakaya</_-xa>
<_-xa>Three Bodies of the Buddha</_-xa>

"In Mahayana Buddhism, the 'truth-body' 
or Dharma Body of the Buddhas is 
conceived as a universal metaphysical 
principle." 
"'Dharma-Body,' third of the three 
bodies of the Buddha in Mahayana, and 
used as a synonym for ultimate reality. 
Although present in earlier Mahayana 
thought, later texts like the 
Iankavatara Sutra developed the notion 
of the three bodies of the Buddha more 
fully, with the concept coming to 
maturity in the Yogacara school. There, 
the historical body of Buddha was 
referred to as an 'apparitional body' (
Nirmana-kaya) visible to ordinary, 
common worldlings as an inspiration to 
begin the (Mahayana) Buddhist path. Once
 on the path, as a Bodhisattva, one 
relates to a Buddha in another form: '
enjoyment body' (Sambhoga-kaya), a quasi
-physical preacher of Mahayana sutras. 
Finally, at the completion of the path, 
one attains the 'Dharma Body' (Dharma-
kaya), the true nature of Buddhahood, 
<pb n="596"/>
described in a variety of technical 
terms, all used virtually synonymously: 
Tathata (Suchness), Tathagatagarbha (
Womb of the Tathagata), Buddhata (State 
of Buddhahood), and so forth. In other 
words, each of the three bodies of the 
Buddha speaks to an individual at a 
different level of spiritual development
, with Dharma-kaya representing the true
, ultimate reality."

Mind</_-xa>

"Dharma Realm or Dharmadhatu. Literally,
 'the realm of dharmas' or the cosmos, 
the universe. The reader should bear in 
mind that the term Dharma Realm can also
 mean the 'Mind'." 
In Buddhist texts, the term Dharma Realm
 has several meanings: 1. The nature or 
essence of dharmas; 2. Infinity; 3. The 
infinite universe per se; 4. The mind, 
our mind, which has a fourfold activity 
... In other words, "the universe is 
fourfold: a World (Realm) of factual, 
practical reality; a World of principle 
or theory; a World of principle and 
facts harmonized; and a World of factual
 realities interwoven and mutually 
identified. The last is the harmonious 
whole taught by the Avatamsaka, while 
the first three are the particular 
emphasis of other schools." 
Stated in a different way, "these Four 
Realms are: i) the realm of events (or 
phenomena), which is the world of 
ordinary unenlightened perception; ii) 
the realm or truth ('principle' or 
<pb n="600"/>
noumenon) which is the ultimate non-dual
 reality, identified with 'mind' or '
emptiness' and which lies behind the 
illusory manifestation of phenomena; iii
) the realm of non-obstruction of truth 
and phenomena which means that noumenon 
and phenomena are two aspects of the 
same thing, and that phenomena, rightly 
perceived, are noumenon or ultimate 
reality; iv) the realm of non-
obstruction of phenomenon and phenomenon
 (Dharma Realm of All Phenomena 
Unobstructed), corresponding to Tu Shun'
s 'all in all,' and implying that each 
phenomenon, each spatio-temporal event, 
simultaneously includes all others." 
Dharma Realm is all things, all time, 
all places. It is one and we all are it.
NOTE:
"Ordinary people usually consider it 
difficult to become a Buddha. In fact, 
it is not so difficult. Both Buddhas and
 ordinary sentient beings are invariably
 molded out of perception and 
contemplation. In one thought, Buddhas 
pervade the ten Dharma Worlds (Dharma 
Realms). Likewise, a sentient being also
 pervades ten Dharma Worlds in one 
thought. If avarice arises at one 
thought, he is, indeed, a hungry ghost. 
<pb n="601"/>
If hatred arises at one thought, he is a
 hell-dweller. If delusion arises at one
 thought, he is a beast. If doubt and 
arrogance arise at one thought, he is an
 asura, a malevolent spirit. If one's 
thoughts fall on the Five Virtues, as 
well as the Five Precepts, he will enter
 the world of humans. If his thoughts 
touch upon the ten Good Karmas, he will 
be reborn in heaven. If his ideas are 
centered on the Four Noble Truths, he 
equals the Buddha's immediate disciples.
 If his mind dwells on the doctrine of 
Twelve Links of Causation, he is a 
Pratyekabuddha. If his ideas center on 
the Six Paramitas, he is a Bodhisattva. 
If his thoughts dwell on altruism and 
equality, he is indeed a Buddha." (
Master T'an Hsu)

Whatever their apparent differences,

the same as that of all phenomena, is 
said to at once pervade and contain all 
phenomena; and as this is true of one, 
so is it true of all. Furthermore, the 
interdependence of phenomena means that 
ultimately one depends on all and all 
depend on one, whether immediately or 
remotely; therefore, the existence of 
all is considered an intrinsic part of 
the existence of one, and vice versa."

Sakyamuni Buddha taught three basic 
Dharma seals, or criteria, to determine 
the genuineness of Buddhist teachings or
 truths: Impermanence; Suffering and No-
self. In the Mahayana tradition, an 
additional set of Dharma Seals is often 
mentioned. The set, as taught in 
Mahayana sutras, consists of three seals
: Emptiness, No-Mark (Marklessness, 
Signlessness), and No-Wish (Wishlessness
). 
NOTE:
An interesting corollary of the concept 
of Dharma seals is that much of the 
speculation about whether or not this or
 that sutra is genuine is, in a sense, 
pointless. A sutra is a sutra because it
 contains the words of the Buddhas/ 
<pb n="604"/>
Bodhisattvas or because the ideas 
expressed in it conform to the Dharma 
seals. An example of the latter is the 
Platform Sutra, which records the words 
of the Sixth Patriarch.

The present spiritually degenerate era, 
twenty-six centuries since the demise of
 Shakyamuni Buddha. The concept of 
decline, dissension and schism within 
the Dharma after the passing of the 
Buddha is a general teaching of Buddhism
 and a corollary to the Truth of 
Impermanence. See, for example, the 
<pb n="605"/>
Diamond Sutra (sect. 6 in the 
translation by A.F. Price and Wong Mou-
lam). The time following Buddha 
Shakyamuni's demise has been divided 
into three periods: i) the Perfect Age 
of the Dharma, lasting 500 years, when 
the Buddha's teaching was correctly 
practiced and Enlightenment often 
attained; ii) the Dharma Semblance Age, 
lasting about 1,000 years, when a form 
of the teaching was practiced but 
enlightenment seldom attained; iii) the 
Dharma-Ending Age, lasting some 'ten 
thousand' years, when a diluted form of 
the teaching exists and Enlightenment is
 rarely attained. (See entry, Ten 
Thousand)

<_-xa>the following poetic prophecy:</_-xa>
"In the last stages of degeneration (

relics of the cremated Buddha -- the 
teeth, bones, fingernails and hair -- 
will break free from their reliquaries, 
the stupas and pagodas, and magically 
travel to Bodhgaya where they will 
reassemble beneath the tree where the 
<pb n="606"/>

they will be worshiped one last time by 
the gods before they burst into flames

The Bodhisattva who later became

Dharmakara is famous for forty-eight 
Vows, particularly the eighteenth, which
<pb n="607"/>
 promises rebirth in the Pure Land to 
anyone who recites His name with utmost 
sincerity and faith (i.e., 
singlemindedly) at the time of death.

"Dharmakara -- Amitabha Buddha in his 
previous life -- pledged to the Buddha 
preceding him (Lokesvara) that he would 
fulfill 48 vows in his pursuit of 
Buddhahood. They appear in the Larger 
Sukhavati-vyuha (Longer Amitabha Sutra).
 These vows
were made by Dharmakara in order to 
establish his own Buddha-World, namely 
Sukhavati (Pure Land), on the basis of 
the 21 billion Buddha-worlds which he 
had seen."

'In the sacred Buddhist texts of China, 
the Longer Amitabha Sutra concerns 
Amitabha Buddha and his Pure Land. On a 
certain occasion, Sakyamuni Buddha (the 
Buddha of our present age) was on 
Vulture Peak, surrounded by his 
disciples. Ananda, the Buddha's personal
 attendant noticed the radiant beauty of
 Buddha and inquired about the cause of 
the Buddha's joy. Sakyamuni relates the 
following story: In an infinite time in 
the past, Bhiksu Dharmakara observed the

(I) Forty-eight vows
"The vows which Amitabha Buddha made 
while still engaged in Bodhisattva 
practice as Bodhisattva Dharmakara. They
 are listed in the Longer Amitabha Sutra
. According to this sutra, Bodhisattva 
Dharmakara wished to create a splendid 
Buddha land in which he would live when 
<pb n="609"/>
he attained Buddhahood. Under the 
guidance of Lokeshvara Buddha, he 
studied the characteristics of twenty-
one billion Buddha lands and then 
meditated for five aeons, pondering the 
features which should dignify his own 
Buddha land. After completing this 
meditation, Bodhisattva Dharmakara made 
forty-eight vows ... Among these vows, 
the eighteenth -- that all who place 
their trust in Amitabha Buddha hall 
obtain rebirth in the Pure Land, 
excepting those who commit any of the 
Five Cardinal Sins or slander the True 
Law -s the one most emphasized in Pure 
Land." 
(II) How The Vows Work
"Amitabha Buddha is foremost. This is 
because of the power of his vows. This 
power is so great that when you 
singlemindedly recite 'Nam Mo Amitabha 
Buddha,' you can very quickly realize 
Buddhahood. To become a Buddha, all you 
need to do is recite the Buddha's name. 
The Dharma-door of Buddha Recitation 
works on the same principle as the 
mother-son relationship. Those who 
recite the Buddha's name are like the '
sons' and the Buddha is like everyone's 
'mother'. Whoever recites Amitabha 
<pb n="610"/>
Buddha's name is like Amitabha Buddha's 
son. In the Surangama Sutra, in the 
section in which the twenty-five sages 
explain their ways to enlightenment, the
 Bodhisattva Great Strength (
Mahastamaprapta) says, 'It is like a 
mother thinking of her son. If the son 
has gone to roam...' If the son leaves 
his mother, it is hard for his mother to
 find him again. But if the son wants to
 find his mother, all he has to do is 
return home. If the mother thinks of her
 son, but the son cares not for his 
mother, he will run farther and farther 
away. If the mother thinks of her son 
and the son is mindful of his mother, 
then they will always be together. All 
of us are the sons and daughters of 
Amitabha Buddha. All we need to do is 
wish to return home and we can. If we 
don't want to return home, our father 
and mother might wait for us, but there 
is nothing they can do." 
(III) Exclusion Clause
The l8th vow of the Bodhisattva 
Dharmakara promises rebirth in the Pure 
Land to anyone who puts his utmost faith
 in him, except "those who have 
committed one of the Five Cardinal Sins 
or slandered the Dharma" (Exclusion 
<pb n="611"/>
Clause). 
"Both Patriarchs T'an-luan and Shan-tao 
discuss the clause, partly to resolve 
apparent inconsistencies with a similar 
provision stated in the Meditation Sutra
. Shan-tao states, however, that its 
purpose is not to exclude certain beings
. Rather, the Buddha, fearing that we 
would commit these two kinds of faults (
Cardinal Sins and slandering the Dharma)
, seeks to stop us by declaring that we 
will then not be able to attain birth in
 the Pure Land... the clause is intended
 (as a warning) to make us realize the 
extreme gravity of the offenses."

 of Wisdom (Prajna-paramita) group of 
the Mahayana Canon. The Heart Sutra is a
 smaller epitome of this 'Wisdom which 
has gone beyond'." 
"This sutra sets forth the doctrines of 
sunyata and prajna. It is a very popular
 scripture, and many commentaries have 
been written on it. It is highly 
esteemed as a basic sutra in the Zen 
<pb n="614"/>
Sect. There are six Chinese translations
: the most popular being by Kumarajiva 
of the Later Chin (Shin) Dynasty."

I. Summary
"In an assembly of monks (bhikkus) 
numbering 1250, the venerable Subhuti 
got up and asked the Buddha how they 
should proceed to attain the perfect 
wisdom (anuttara-samyak-sambuddhi). He 
then explained at considerable length 
six practices (paramitas) -- of charity 
(dana), of keeping the precepts (shila),
 of patience (kshanti), of resolution (
virya), of meditation (dhyana), and of 
direct knowledge or wisdom (prajna). 
Each of these in turn is related to 
freedom from separate selfhood involved 
in their respective perfection since the
 true selfness or suchness (tathata) of 
all beings and things is a void (shunya/
sunya) as far as separate 
characteristics are concerned. In the 
detailed explanations of these matters 
in the Diamond Sutra, there is very much
 food for Zenic meditation. Finally, 
Subhuti asked by what name this 
scripture should be known, and Buddha 
said as the Vajracchedika Prajna 
Paramita. Vajra means diamond, because 
<pb n="615"/>
it is impregnable." 
II. Note
"One of its most ardent translators, 
Professor Edward Conze, remarks in his 
introductory note to Buddhist Wisdom 
Books, that the meaning of the text is 
so difficult to elicit because its 
particulars are '(1) Buddhist technical 
terms, (2) in Sanskrit, (3) used by 
sages, and (4) for the purpose of 
spiritual emancipation.' The last two 
points reveal that the text 'discloses 
itself not to erudition but to 
meditation.'"

<_-xa>Easy Path of Practice</_-xa>

One of the two categories into which 
Nagarjuna divides Buddhist practice in 
the Dasabhumika (Ten stages) Commentary.
 The difficult-to-practice way means the
 exertion of strenuous effort in austere
 practice for countless aeons in order 
to attain enlightenment. It means the 
attainment of enlightenment through one'
s own power. 'The expression 'difficult-
to-practice way' is used in contrast to 
the 'easy-to-practice way.' In the Pure 
Land school, the difficult-to-practice 
way is interpreted as the practice of 
any of the sutras other than the three 
basic sutras of the school." 
According to Pure Land teachings, the 
<pb n="617"/>
Difficult Path of Practice refers to all
 conventional Buddhist ways of practice 
and cultivation (Zen, Theravada, the 
Vinaya School ...), which emphasize self
 power and self-reliance. This is 
contrasted to the Easy Path of Practice,
 that is, the Pure Land method, which 
relies on both self-power and other-
power (the power and assistance of the 
Buddhas and Bodhisattvas).

Buddhism of Wisdom ＆ Faith/ excerpts:
"Compassionate individuals, or those who
 have the interests of the Dharma at 
heart, generally go through three stages
: in the first, they are eager and 
enthusiastic; in the second, they grow 
sad and discouraged; in the third and 
last stage, they achieve the mind of 
compassion and wisdom, adapted to 
circumstances. Unfortunately, however, 
these good and eager individuals usually
 give up and lose their determination 
during the second stage; very few reach 
the third stage. To get past the second 
stage and reach the third, we must have 
a mind of great compassion and wisdom, 
like the mythical dragon which can soar 
to the blue yonder or hide in the ocean 
<pb n="619"/>
depths. Confucian followers express this
 idea as follows: 'The true scholar 
teaches the Way if the world is 
receptive; if the time is not right, he 
retreats and lives in seclusion.' 
Confucius himself, at one point in his 
career, saw his teachings rejected by 
the local rulers. At that time, he 
retreated to write books and teach his 
disciples, his determination to help the
 world intact. Those who do not 
understand this principle of timing and 
conditions are usually discouraged and 
stricken with sadness! The fervent 
resolve that some possess when first 
developing the Bodhi Mind resembles that
 of the great Bodhisattvas. However, 
with time, because of karmic 
obstructions within and adverse 
conditions without, they grow lazy and 
arrogant. Their thoughts are then no 
different from those of ordinary people.
 These practitioners, in general, do not
 yet understand the world of the Five 
Turbidities; therefore, they easily 
regress when faced with reality. For 
this reason, many monks and nuns, 
witnessing errors within their own ranks
 or seeing the many afflictions and 
attachments of the laity, develop 
<pb n="620"/>
retrogressive thoughts. From there, they
 either abandon the Order and return to 
lay life, or they lose their altruistic 
determination, preferring to live in 
seclusion, practicing by themselves, 
unwilling to teach and save others. 
Likewise, many lay Buddhists, 
discouraged at the number of monks and 
nuns who commit transgressions, abandon 
Buddhism and cut off relations with the 
clergy; or else, they grow scornful and 
decide to take refuge only in the Buddha
 and the Dharma, but not in the Sangha. 
Still others, hearing rumors that their 
teacher has committed certain 
transgressions, hastily abandon all 
practice, without even taking time to 
investigate the matter. These people 
have only a shallow grasp of the Dharma,
 failing to realize that we cultivate 
for ourselves, not for our teachers and 
that to abandon practice is detrimental 
to ourselves alone, not to others. As a 
general comment, the states of sadness 
and discouragement described above are 
all misguided and wrong. This is because
, in life, as within the Order, genuine 
and honest practitioners, while rare, do
 indeed exist. 'Sugar cane is eaten by 
worms only in certain spots; a roof 
<pb n="621"/>
leaks only in certain places.' Just 
because certain individuals transgress, 
let us not generalize and think that 
everyone is bad and wrong. Moreover, 
human beings are bad and false; the Way 
is neither bad nor false. Even if 
everyone were in the wrong, the Dharma 
would still be the shining, enlightened 
Way that leads us to liberation." 



<xa>DISCOURSE</xa>

Avatarnsaka Sutra: 
A famous discourse which Master Fa-Tsang
 delivered to Empress Wu of China, 
illustrating a key point of the 
Avatamsaka philosophy -- the 
interpenetration of noumenon and 
phenomena. 
When Fa-Tsang expounded the philosophy 
of Hua-yen to the Royal Court, he used 
the golden lion in the palace to 
illustrate the unimpeded mutual 
interpretation between 1i (noumenon) and
 shih (phenomena). The lion symbolizes 
shih, or appearance, which has no 
reality without the gold. On the other 
<pb n="622"/>
hand, gold lacks meaningful expression 
without the form of the lion as its 
appearance. The existence of each is 
dependent upon the other. Yet the gold 
and the lion distinctly exist by 
themselves. When by mutual 
interpretation gold is lion and lion is 
gold, the dichotomy between reality and 
appearance disappears.

largest Zen school of Buddhism in Japan 
(1200-1253). Dogen studied the teaching 
of the T'sao-tung school in China for 
four years before bringing it in 1227 to
 Japan. He stands alone as the Founder 
<pb n="624"/>
of the Japanese school, and is by far 
its greatest name. He would have no 
dealings with the Court, but retired to 
the mountains where he founded Eiheiji

NOTE: 
Most ancient masters, including such

that only monks and nuns could achieve

capacity of most people. (See, for

pitiless inquisitions, cruel murders, 
violence, infamy, tortures and burning 
of innocent beings. One is also reminded
 of the barbaric and ruthless crusades. 
All these events were stimulated by 
dogmatic beliefs in religious authority 
and the intolerance resulting therefrom.
 Before the development of scientific 
knowledge, people had many superstitious
 beliefs. For example a lot of people 
believed that the eclipse of the sun and
 moon brought bad luck and pestilence. 
Today we know that such beliefs are not 
true. Again some unscrupulous 
religionists encourage people to believe
 in superstitions so that they can make 
use of their followers for their own 
benefit. When people have truly purified
 their minds of ignorance, they will see
 the universe as it really is and they 
will not suffer from superstition and

Buddhism of Wisdom ＆ faith/ excerpts:
"The cultivator at times drifts into a 
<pb n="627"/>
dark, heavy mental state, akin to sleep;
 this is the delusive obstruction of 
drowsiness. At other times, while he 
recites the Buddha's name, his mind 
wanders and is filled with sundry 
thoughts. This is the delusive condition
 of 'mind-scattering.'
Drowsiness and mind-scattering are two 
very dangerous obstacles because they 
hinder cultivation and prevent the 
practitioner from entering samadhi. As 
the cultivator practices, his delusive 
thoughts may suddenly be submerged and 
stilled. He recites the Buddha's name in
 an even monotone, with calm mind and 
thought, oblivious even to the weather 
and insect bites. This state usually 
lasts from one-half to one hour. 
Sometimes sweat soaks his clothing 
without his knowledge, and only when he 
suddenly awakens does he perceive an 
uncomfortable sensation of extreme heat.
 Experiencing this, he should not hasten
 to rejoice, thinking that his mind has 
settled, or that his practice is bearing
 some results. In reality, this is only 
the state of drowsiness in its subtle, 
mild form. The ancients have said: 
Gently, gently, if drowsiness is not 
exposed, the demons will have their fill
<pb n="628"/>
 all day. In this situation, the 
cultivator should take steps to practice
 steadfastly, with increased diligence 
and vigor. As he recites, he should '
turn the light around,' to subdue and 
destroy drowsiness. In general, 
according to the author's experience, as
 drowsiness approaches, it is preceded 
by delusive, scattered thoughts. There 
are, of course, times when drowsiness 
and delusive thoughts arise at the same 
time. However, this is a gross 
manifestation, easily detectable. When 
subtle drowsiness approaches, at first 
subtle errant thoughts arise. The 
practitioner feels that a dim spot is 
climbing from the back of his neck to 
the top of his head, then descending to 
the eyes, ending somewhere deep in the 
Alaya consciousness. Wherever drowsiness
 goes, that part of the body is affected
. If it reaches the head, the head 
droops slightly; if it reaches the eyes,
 the eyes close; if it reaches the mind,
 the mind becomes clouded. The 
practitioner should possess a very keen,
 discerning mind to detect this subtle 
form of torpor."

Heart Sutra: Form is emptiness, 
Emptiness is form.
Illustrative Story
"Once a beautiful and well-dressed woman
 visited a house. The master of the 
house asked her who she was; and she 
replied that she was the goddess of 
wealth. The master of the house was 
<pb n="630"/>
delighted and so greeted her with open 
arms. Soon after another woman appeared 
who was ugly looking and poorly dressed.
 The master asked who she was and the 
woman replied that she was the goddess 
of poverty. The master was frightened 
and tried to drive her out 'of the house
, but the woman refused to depart, 
saying, 'The goddess of wealth is my 
sister. There is an agreement between us
 that we are never to live apart; if you
 chase me out, she is to go with me.' 
Sure enough, as soon as the ugly woman 
went out, the other woman disappeared. 
Birth goes with death. Fortune goes with
 misfortune. Bad things follow good 
things. Men should realize this. Foolish
 people dread misfortune and strive 
after good fortune, but those who seek 
Enlightenment must transcend both of 
them and be free of worldly attachments.

"Refers to Pure Land practice. The Easy 
Path involves reliance on the power of 
the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, in 
particular Buddha Amitabha ('other-power
') in addition to one's own cultivation 
('self-power'). Usually contrasted with 
primary reliance on self-power (
Difficult Path of Practice), taught in 
other Buddhist schools. Simultaneous 
reliance on self-power and other-power 
distinguishes the Pure Land School from 
most other schools of Buddhism. The 
distinction is, however, a matter of 
emphasis, as all schools of Buddhism 
rely, to a greater or lesser extent, on 
both self-power and other-power." 
"In the 'Commentary of the Ten Stages' 
chapter on 'Easy Practice,' Patriarch 
Nagarjuna discusses the attainment of 
the non-retrogressive state and then 
distinguishes two paths. The first 
<pb n="636"/>
follows the 'easy practice' (i-hsing) of
 devotion, which is likened to riding on
 a vessel over water. The 'difficult' (
nan) path resembles a Bodhisattva 
walking on land to his destination. 
Amitabha is one among numerous 
transcendent Buddhas to whom devotion of
 easy practice may be directed. In East 
Asia, the distinction between the 
difficult and the easy path served as 
one of the primary doctrinal bases for 
the establishment of Pure Land as an 
independent school." 
(I) Why The Easy Path?
"There are two paths of cultivation. The
 Difficult Path refers to the practices 
of sentient beings in the world of the 
Five Turbidities, who, through countless
 Buddha eras, have aspired to reach the 
stage of Non-Retrogression. The 
difficulties are truly countless, as 
numerous as specks of dust or grains of 
sand, too numerous to imagine. I will 
summarize the five major ones: a) 
Externalists are legion, creating 
confusion with respect to the 
Bodhisattva Dharma; b) Evil beings 
destroy the practitioner's good, 
wholesome virtues; c) Worldly merits and
 blessings can easily lead the 
<pb n="637"/>
practitioner astray, so that he ceases 
to engage in virtuous practices; d) It 
is easy to stray onto the Arhat's path 
of self-benefit, which obstructs the 
Mind of great compassion; e) Relying 
exclusively on self-power, without the 
aid of the Buddha's power, makes 
cultivation very difficult and arduous. 
It is not unlike the case of a feeble, 
handicapped person, walking alone, who 
can only go so far each day regardless 
of how much effort he expends. 'The Easy
 Path of cultivation means that if 
sentient beings in this world believe in
 the Buddha's words, practice Buddha 
Recitation and vow to be reborn in the 
Pure Land, they are assisted by the 
Buddha's vow-power and assured of 
rebirth. This is analagous to a person 
who floats downstream in a boat; 
although the distance may be many 
thousands of miles, his destination will
 be reached in no time."' (T'ien T'ai 
Patriarch Chih I) 
(II) Pure Land School
"Everyone can appreciate why Pure Land, 
particularly Oral Recitation (q.v.), is 
an Easy-to-Practice method. However, the
 word 'easy' has many meanings. with 
which not everyone may be familiar. This
<pb n="638"/>
 is because when practicing other 
methods, for example, Scriptural Studies
, we encounter an immense number of 
sutras and commentaries, infinitely 
profound in meaning. In the first 
instance, the practitioner should fully 
understand the basic teaching and, from 
there, penetrate the different shades of
 meaning. After that, he should 
reconcile all meanings, extracting their
 kernel and essence, to discover and 
choose the method of cultivation that he
 will follow all his life. All this 
cannot be done unless he is willing to 
spend several dozen years of hard work. 
Should he decide to seek liberation 
through the Discipline method, the 
practitioner must join the Order and 
become thoroughly conversant with all 
aspects of the different bodies of 
precepts. He should also possess the 
wisdom to distinguish meaning from words
 and apply the precepts in a flexible 
manner, according to the environment, 
the times and the occasion. Thus, to 
study the sutras is not necessarily 
difficult, but to study the precepts to 
the point of knowing how to adapt them 
skillfully, neither breaking them nor 
being rigidly bound by them, is truly 
<pb n="639"/>
difficult. Once having understood the 
precepts, the practitioner must exercise
 patience and fortitude and endure 
discomfort and suffering in order to 
achieve success. If he decides to enter 
the Way through Zen, he should have 
previously sown the seeds of wisdom and 
have suitably high innate capacities. 
Otherwise, he has no hope of attaining 
this lofty Dharma and participating in 
the 'transmission of the lamp' (the 
enlightenment experience). Therefore, a 
famous Buddhist scholar once said: 
Practicing Zen to achieve Buddhahood is 
the domain of scholars endowed with 
wisdom. This observation is certainly 
not incorrect or exaggerated. With Oral 
Recitation, once the practitioner has 
developed the mind of Faith and Vows, he
 can recite the Buddha's name and engage
 in cultivation regardless of whether 
his capacities are high, moderate or 
limited. Moreover, while other methods 
depend on self-power alone, the Pure 
Land Dharma Door first relies to the 
utmost on self-power and then adds the 
element of 'other-power.' Other-power is
 precisely the infinitely great and 
powerful Vow of Amitabha Buddha' to 
welcome and escort.' As long as a 
<pb n="640"/>
practitioner sincerely repents and 
recites the Buddha's name with one-
pointedness of mind, even though he is 
not yet free of delusions and is still 
afflicted with heavy evil karma, he, too
, will be welcomed to the Pure Land.
"The ancients used to say, by way of 
comparison: Practicing other methods is 
as difficult and laborious as an ant 
climbing a high mountain; reciting the 
Buddha's name seeking rebirth in the 
Pure Land is as swift and easy as a boat
 sailing downstream in the direction of 
the blowing wind. This observation is 
very appropriate indeed. Moreover, once 
reborn there, living in an auspicious 
and peaceful environment, always in the 
company of Buddha Amitabha and the 
Bodhisattvas, the practitioner will 
swiftly achieve success in whatever 
Dharma method he chooses. He is like a 
log rolling down a high mountain, which 
just keeps going and never stops, even 
for a moment.
"In summary, Buddha Recitation is easy 
for three reasons: easy practice, easy 
achievement of rebirth in the Pure Land 
and easy attainment of Buddhahood. 
Therefore, the results achieved through 
Buddha Recitation from time immemorial 
<pb n="641"/>
can be compared to the clear and limpid 
sound of precious stones striking 
against genuine gold, or the sight of "
smiling lotus blossoms with their fresh 
and fragrant grades of rebirth." Within 
these levels and grades, the path from 
sentient being to Buddhahood contains 
many ranks, yet is also without rank. 
This is because, once reborn in the Pure
 Land, the practitioner has transcended 
Birth and Death -- and to recite the 
Buddha's name is to become Buddha. This 
is like the silkworm, the cocoon and the
 butterfly, which are inseparable; there
 is very little difference between 
saying that a butterfly is originally a 
worm and that the worm is the butterfly.

<xa>EASY</xa>
<_-xa>Easy Path of Practice</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Nagarjuna</_-xa>

Please read Ten Stages Sutra (Commentary
 on) before the following:
"The chapter on easy practice which 
Nagarjuna wrote as the ninth chapter of 
his Commentary on the Ten Stages Sutra (
<pb n="642"/>
 Dhasabumika / Shih-chu-p'i-p'o-sha-lun)
. Translated into Chinese by Kumarajiva 
(Jpn/ Raju). In this chapter, Nagarjuna 
explains the doctrine of Amitabha as 
taught by the Buddha, saying that human 
beings can easily attain enlightenment 
by chanting the name of Amitabha Buddha.
 He stresses the salvation of Amitabha 
Buddha. Honen, the founder of the 
Japanese Pure Land School, esteemed this
 text as one of the most important 
scriptures teaching the doctrine of the 
Pure Land tradition." 



<xa>EATING</xa>
<_-xa>Zen School，禪宗</_-xa>

"Eating when hungry, sleeping when tired
": this Zen statement, which usually 
baffles non-Buddhists, actually reflects
 a deep truth. Most people do not eat 
when hungry, that is, they do not eat 
what is available or what is good for 
them, but rather seek special dishes 
prepared to their taste. Likewise, they 
do not sleep when tired, but are likely 
to do other things, such as tossing and 
turning in bed recalling past wrongs or 
<pb n="643"/>
mulling over future events. ... "All 
eagerness for study gone"; the goal of 
all Buddhist teaching is to stop the 
mind from wandering, keeping it empty 
and still, so that our innate wisdom can
 surface. In that context, love, hatred 
and eagerness for study are all 
attachments that disturb the mind.




<xa>EGO，我</xa>
<_-xa>Anger</_-xa>; <_-xa>Enemies</_-xa>

"In Buddhism, ego refers to the notion 
of oneself as a fixed and discrete 
entity separate from other selves and 
from an 'outside world.' Thus a silently
 stubborn or self-deprecating person may
 be said to have as strong an ego as one
 who is, say, proud and domineering. 
Through awakening, the illusory nature 
of the ego is seen through." 
Question/Answer
"I am aware of how much fear affects my 
behavior and inhibits me from making 
contact with other people. Fear seems to
 affect other people in this way too. 
Does this explain the emphasis on 
<pb n="644"/>
fearlessness in the list of the things 
that the Bodhisattva gives?"
Answer: "The Bodhisattva's giving of 
fearlessness seems to suggest that 
people are badly in need of it. Fear is 
produced by a sense of separateness, or 
ego for want of a better term. You 
should not be surprised to experience 
fear in all sorts of situations. It is 
just an indication of the fact that you 
experience yourself as self, as an ego; 
whenever you experience yourself in that
 way there is the possibility of fear. 
Until you have transcended the sense of 
separateness there will be fear, because
 you are bound to be afraid of whatever 
threatens you. The gift of fearlessness 
is therefore ultimately the gift of 
insight into egolessness, and this is 
why it is so important. It could even be
 called an aspect of the gift of the 
Dharma, in the sense of some actual 
experience of insight, not just the 
words of the Dharma."

wearing bodily decoration, not using 
perfumes, not singing and dancing, and 
not going to see dances or plays, (7) 
not sleeping in a raised bed, and (8)

These special retreats are popular among
 devout lay Buddhists and are considered
 a good preparation for joining the

"The eight kinds of gods and demi-gods

devas, dragons, yaksas, gandharvas, 
asuras, garudas, kinnaras, and mahoragas
." 
"These are various classes of non-human 
beings that are regarded as protectors 
of the Buddhist Dharma and often appear 
as part of the audience attending the 
Buddha's sermons. Strictly speaking, not
 all are celestials, but most of them 
inhabit the celestial or heavenly 
spheres of a world system. The eight 
classes, are: (1) gods (deva); (2) 
asuras; (3) the gandharvas and (4) the 
kinnaras; local spirits known as (5) 
yakshas (yaksa), sometimes associated 
with the Tushita Heaven, but usually 
located on the human plane; two kinds of
 mythical serpents, (6) the mahoragas 
and (7) the nagas; and (8) the celestial
 eagles known as the garudas. 
Technically, the nagas and the asuras, 
perhaps the yakshas, should not be in 
this class, since their abode is not in 
the heavens. The nagas are usually 
<pb n="648"/>
placed in the nether world or under the 
sea. The asuras live on the slopes of 
Mount Sumeru, below the lowest heavenly 
sphere, which is that of the four 
Guardian Kings. All eight kinds of 
celestials appear prominently in the

 (For a detailed exposition of the eight

Buddhism of Wisdom and Faith, sect. 5.) 
To illustrate the point that suffering 
is an inevitable part of our world, let 
us consider the example, adapted from 
the sutras, of worms feeding on rotten 
apples. The worms are "running" hither 
and yon among the apples, each worm "
elbowing" the others for a better spot, 
a larger piece of the rotten matter. 
They all feel their actions necessary 
and desirable. They all seem very busy 
and very happy. To us humans, however, 
theirs is indeed a pitiable lot. The 
human condition is the same from the

viewpoint of celestials, Bodhisattvas 
and Buddhas -- such a pitiful sight 
indeed, whether of beggars or

 and avoiding such livelihoods as 
trading in weapons, intoxicants, or

All feelings and emotions, whether good

peacefulness of the mind, preventing one
's innate wisdom from manifesting itself
. Therefore, they should all be avoided 
equally. A person overcome by any kind 
of emotion is not on an even keel and 
may not exercise good judgment or do 
what has to be done. Thus, joy, too, is 
<pb n="658"/>
an affliction! (Note: The word "joy" 
used to describe life in the Pure Land 
of Amitabha Buddha is not the ordinary 
joy of this world but is rather the joy 
of "permanence, bliss, self and purity" 
-- the opposite of the Dharma seals (q.v

self that characterize the Saha World). 



<xa>EMPOWERMENT</xa>
<_-xa>Pure Land School</_-xa>

The Pure Land school is a good example 
of the simple, pragmatic approach of 
Buddhism. The accoutrements of practice,
 while useful as aids, are not essential
 in themselves and may be adapted to 
circumstances. There is no absolute need
 for meditation cushions, mandalas, 
gurus, etc. Pure Land thus liberates the
 practitioner, enabling him to 
concentrate on practice. For an 
interesting parallel between Pure Land 
and the "Zen of the Patriarchs," see the
 following passage: "While others viewed
 Zen as purification of the mind ... 
Bodhidharma equated Zen with Buddhahood 
-- and Buddhahood with the mind, the 
<pb n="659"/>
everyday, undiscriminating mind ... 
Bodhidharma's Zen was Mahayana Zen, not 
Theravada Zen -- the sword of wisdom, 
not the meditation cushion." (Red Pine, 
The Zen Teaching of Bodhidharma, p. xv.)

Nagarjuna</_-xa>; <_-xa>Subhuti</_-xa>; <_-xa>True Emptiness/Wonderful Existence</_-xa>

Chin/ Kung; Jpn/ Ku; Vn/ Khong.
 "A fundamental Buddhist concept, 
variously translated as non-
substantiality, emptiness, void, latency
, relativity, etc. The concept that 
entities have no fixed or independent 
nature. This idea is closely linked to 
that of dependent origination (Skt./ 
pratitya-samutpada), which states that 
because phenomena arise and continue to 
exist only by virtue of their 
relationship with other phenomena, they 
have no fixed substance and have as 
their true nature emptiness. The concept
 thus teaches that nothing exists 
independently. Its practical 
<pb n="660"/>
implications lie in the rejection of 
attachments to transient phenomena and 
to the egocentricity of one who 
envisions himself as being absolute and 
independent of all other existences. It 
is an especially important concept in 
Mahayana Buddhism. On the basis of 
sutras known as the Wisdom sutras, the 
concept of emptiness was systematized by
 Nagarjuna, who explains it as the 
Middle Way, which here means neither 
existence nor non-existence.
Broadly speaking, the concept of 
emptiness or non-substantiality can be 
divided into two: non-substantiality of 
persons and
non-substantiality of the dharmas (
objects, things, etc.). Non-
substantiality of persons means that a 
living entity, being no more than a 
temporary union of the five components, 
cannot be said to have an absolute self,
 while non-substantiality of the dharmas
 means that, because the dharmas or 
elements of existence arise through 
dependent origination, they have no 
unchanging self-nature. The Tripitaka 
teaching (Theravada) progressively 
analyzed entities or constructs such as 
the self into their constituent elements
<pb n="661"/>
 or dharmas, until they could be defined
 neither as existence nor non-existence;
 this is the analytical view of non-
substantiality. On the other hand, the 
Connecting Teaching (early Mahayana) 
says that because all things arise 
through dependent origination, their 
existence is in itself non-substantial. 
The Perfect Teaching (q.v.) reveals that
 non-substantiality is inseparably 
united with the truths of temporary 
existence and the Middle Way, explaining
 that each of the three truths possesses
 all three within itself." 
As stated in the Heart Sutra:
"O Sariputra, form does not differ from 
the Void, and the Void does not differ 
from Form. Form is the Void, and Void is
 Form: the same is true for feelings, 
conceptions, impulses and consciousness.
"

True emptiness is contrasted with "
hollow emptiness," or "stubborn 
emptiness," which is one-sided and leads
 to nihilism (the belief that nothing 
exists after death). Thus, we have the 
Mahayana expression, "True Emptiness, 
Wonderful Existence" -- True Emptiness 
is not empty!
<pb n="662"/>

On the subject of existence and 
emptiness, an ancient Zen Master has 
said: "If we refer to existence, then/ 
Everything from the smallest mote of 
dust exists;/ If we refer to emptiness,/
 This whole, wide world and everything 
in it are empty."

related comment below: D.T. Suzuki 
quotes the Zen Patriarch Fa Yen as 
follows:
"The sutras preached by the Buddha 
during his lifetime are said to amount 
to five thousand and forty-eight 
fascicles; they include the doctrine of 
emptiness and the doctrine of being (
existence); there are teachings of 
immediate realization and of gradual 
development. Is it not an affirmation?
"But, according to (Zen Master Yung Chia
 in his Song of Enlightenment), 'there 
are no sentient beings, there are no 
Buddhas; sages as numerous as the sands 
of the Ganges are but so many bubbles in
 the sea; sages and worthies of the past
 are like flashes of lightning.' Is this
 not a negation?
"O you, my disciples, if you say there 
is, you go against Yung Chia; if you say
<pb n="663"/>
 there is not, you contradict our old 
master Buddha. If he were with us, then 
how would he pass through the dilemma? .
 If you confess your ignorance, I will 
let you
<_-xa>into the secret. When I say there 
is not, this does not necessarily mean a
 negation; when I say there is, this 
also does not signify an affirmation. 
Turn eastward and look at the Western 
Land; face the south and the North Star 
is pointed out there!"</_-xa>
"This is a recurring quandary for people
 who are interested in Buddhist doctrine
: If there is no 'I', no 'mine', and all
 dharmas are utterly empty, how can the 
law of karma prevail? The answer is: it 
is precisely because everything is empty
 and there is no self or 'I', that 
everything can exist and the principle 
of karma can prevail. If things were 
truly existent, i.e., with a definite, 
enduring substance or entity, then no 
change or flow would be possible. 
Because nothing has self-nature (
svabhava), everything is possible. The 
Buddhist way of thinking is unique in 
this aspect. To understand this point 
more clearly, the reader is referred to 
the Madhyamika and Prajnaparamita 
<pb n="664"/>
literature." 
NOTES:
(I) The Buddha taught countless schools 
or Dharma methods. Among these methods, 
Zen, T'ien T'ai, etc. lead to Buddhahood
 through the Door of Emptiness, while 
Pure Land and the Avatamsaka School 
enter through the Door of Existence. (
The Avatamsaka Sutra being encyclopedic 
and expressing the totality of Buddhism,
 also contains the Dharma of Emptiness 
of the Zen school.) 
(II) Unlike certain other schools of 
Buddhism (Zen, Tantric, for example), 
Pure Land does not stress the role of 
gurus, roshi or mentors. Rather, the 
emphasis is
on recitation of the Buddha's name and 
the sutras as well as direct contact and
 communion with Buddha Amitabha -- 
Buddha Amitabha being understood as an 
expression of emptiness or ultimate 
wisdom:
"Kumarajiva (the famous translator of 
sutras from India languages to Chinese)
interpreted Amida Buddha as an 
expression of sunyata (emptiness) and 
recommended Buddha Recitation as a means
 of realizing sunyata or ultimate wisdom
, prajna." (M. Saso ＆ D. Chappell)

"In classical Indian cosmology, every

emptiness through ages of creation, 
abiding, destruction, and then another '
empty eon' of nothingness between cycles

before this universe came to be, i.e., 
at the level of mind."

<xa>ENEMIES</xa>
<_-xa>Afflictions</_-xa>; <_-xa>Ego</_-xa>

"Viewed objectively, enemies can only be
 of two kinds. Either they are 
intrinsically hostile, in which case to 
resent their behavior is as absurd as to
 resent fire for being hot; or they are 
fundamentally well disposed but have 
momentarily succumbed to a crisis of 
defilement. Here, too, animosity is out 
of place: it is as foolish as resenting 
the sky for
being covered with clouds. Besides, when
 someone hits me with a stick, I am 
<pb n="667"/>
angry not with the stick but with the 
one who holds it. By the same token it 
is illogical to hate my enemy. He may 
wield the stick, but ha is himself in 
the grip of his defilements. It is the 
emotion of which he is the victim that I
 should resent. Taking his argument a 
step further, Patriarch Shantideva 
points out that in any conflict, the 
victim and aggressor are both caught up 
in a situation of mutual dependence. In 
the case of the physical attack, for 
example, if pain occurs, it has two 
equally important sources corresponding 
to the two terms of the experience.
The fact that suffering happens depends 
as much on the degree to which the 
victim's mind clings to his body as on 
the wound inflicted by the aggressor. 
Pursuing the argument yet further, 
Shantideva shows how the enemy should 
not merely be an object of tolerance; he
 is to be cherished as an indispensable 
helper on the Bodhisattva path. Our 
enemy does for us what no friend or 
loved one can do. By awakening us to the
 reality of our own ego-clinging, the 
enemy provides opportunities for 
patience, purification, the exhaustion 
of evil karma."

<xa>ENERGY</xa>
A practice not accepted in Buddhism. It 
is referred to nowadays under a variety 
of names, such as Polarity Therapy, Dr. 
Randolph Stone's method, Life Energy 
Healing Arts, Spiritual/Energy Healing, 
Healing Ministry, Laying on Hands 
Ministry. 
"Buddhism encompasses all methods and 
dharmas. Not only does it clearly 
explain the issues of body, mind and 
life, it does not neglect the small 
issues of human morality, such as '
filiality, respect for elders, loyalty, 
faith, propriety, justice, decency and 
shame." An exception is the practice of 
'balancing energy currents,' about which
 not a single word is said in the Buddha
 Dharma. Not only that, Buddhism forbids
 the practice entirely. This is because 
while Taoism regards the preservation of
 body and mind as an ideal, Buddhism, on
 the contrary, teaches that body and 
mind are intrinsically false, born of 
conditions, disappearing also through 
conditions. They are not the Self-Nature
 True Mind." (Patriarch Yin-Kuang) 
<pb n="669"/>
Buddhism of Wisdom ＆ Faith/ excerpts:
"There are some who appear to be monks 
and nuns, residing in temples and 
pagodas; however they neither study nor 
understand Buddhism and only follow the 
practices of other religions. These 
people are peddling a panoply of other 
beliefs under the label of Buddhism. 
They and their followers secretly 
transmit their beliefs to one another. 
Many of them, while claiming to practice
 meditation, in fact specialize in 
exercises to balance energy currents 
with little knowledge of what meditation
 is all about. As far as the Pure Land 
method is concerned, they teach that one
 should visualize the Buddha's name '
shooting' from the navel to the back of 
the body and up the spinal column, and 
then returning to the navel. This, they 
say, is 'turning the Dharma wheel.' This
 is the practice of 'releasing blockages
 in the energy system,' (i.e., balancing
 energy currents) according to 
externalist schools. Such teaching is 
not consonant with Buddhism." 



<xa>ENLIGHTENMENT</xa>
<pb n="670"/>
<_-xa>Awakening vs Enlightenment</_-xa>

Skt/Bodhi. "The spiritual condition of a
 Buddha or Bodhisattva. The cause of 
Bodhi is Prajna or wisdom, and Karuna or
 compassion. Bodhi is the name given to 
the highest state of Samadhi in which 
the mind is awakened and illuminated." 

"Wisdom, Way, and Enlightenment are 
common translations (of Bodhi).
I. The wisdom of the Buddha's 
enlightenment acquired as the result of 
cutting off the two hindrances: passions
 and illusory conceptions. 
II. Nirvana as the state of extinguished
 passions. The cause of Bodhi is wisdom 
and compassion." 

"The Buddha originally taught that 
enlightenment is possible for all beings
, both human and nonhuman. He made it 
very clear that, within the human realm,
 women and men have equal capacity for 
enlightenment. In Theravada countries 
such as
Burma, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, 
enlightenment means liberation from 
Samsara, the cycle of birth and rebirth.
.. In the Mahayana countries, 
<pb n="671"/>
enlightenment means achieving Buddhahood
. One has to practice for many lifetimes
 to become a Buddha, but all living 
beings, can and will."

 is one of the Four Immeasurables, along
 with kindness, compassion and joy.

<_-xa>Ethics</_-xa>; <_-xa>Cosmology (
Buddhist)</_-xa>; <_-xa>Cosmic Age</_-xa>; 
<_-xa>Maitreya，彌勒</_-xa>

"Term used to denote beliefs concerning 
death, judgment, purgatory, heaven and 
hell. With variations, this 
eschatological pattern occurs in all 
religions. Buddhism has no eschatology 
in the strict sense of term as this is 
understood in Christianity, since there 
are no ultimately 'last things' so far 
as the cosmos as a whole is concerned. 
So far as individual human existence is 
concerned, according to Buddhist thought
, the consummation of this is in the '
deathless' state of Nirvana. Buddhist 
cosmology has its heavens and hells, but
 no one is condemned to eternal 
existence in these; eventually the 
inhabitants of both the Buddhist heavens
 and the hells will return to other 
levels of existence. The only strictly '
eschatological' moment for the Buddhist 
is the moment when a man achieves 
awakening or enlightenment (Bodhi). 
Buddhism, with its concept of rebirth, 
and cyclical view of time, envisages 
great cosmic cycles (kalpas through 
<pb n="674"/>
which the soul proceeds in countless 
rebirths until its final absorption in 
Nirvana). Millennialist theories grew up
 with the worship of Maitreya (Mi Lo Fo)
, introduced into China in the 4th 
century AD. According to these theories,
 several millennia after Buddha 
Sakyamuni, Buddhism will have reached 
such a state of decline that Maitreya 
will appear and establish his millennial
 kingdom, and a new cycle of life and 
hope of redemption for all living 
creatures. It is thus that Buddhism 
inculcates hope that at the last hour of
 a final dispensation (mo-fa), a great 
saviour and renewer will descend from 
the Tushita heaven to establish on earth
 a new era."

"Esoteric is a general term for the 
schools of Buddhism using mantras (q.v.)
 and mudras (q.v.) as a principal method
<pb n="675"/>
 of cultivation. These schools exist in 
the Mahayana tradition of most Asian 
countries. However, in practice, the 
term is often used synonymously with the
 Tantric School of Tibet (Vajrayana). 
The esoteric (secret) teachings of 
Buddhism are found in the Esoteric and 
Tien Tai schools and refer to those 
doctrines and rituals, deeply influenced
 by Hinduism, that developed in India 
during the seventh and eighth centuries.
 These teachings, having magical 
properties, can only be revealed to 
those who have been properly initiated. 
The exoteric teachings include all 
Buddhist teachings other than the above.
" 
"According to the doctrines of this 
school, Vajra-sattva received the 
teachings directly from Mahavairocana 
Buddha, compiled them as scripture, and 
sealed them in an iron tower in south 
India. This tower was opened eight 
hundred years after the demise of 
Sakyamuni, by Nagarjuna, who then 
revealed the long hidden scriptures. 
These scriptures were brought to China 
by Vajrabohi, Subhakaraismha, and 
Amoghavajra. (The Japanese Esoteric 
Patriarch) Kukai received them from Hui-
<pb n="676"/>
kuo (Keika), who was a disciple of 
Amoghavajra." 
NOTE:
"While the monastic tradition was not 
abandoned, a highly complex series of 
initiations, empowerments, and other 
rituals was integrated into monastic 
life. The great saints of Vajrayana were
 called Mahasiddhas, notorious for 
possessing magical powers and having 
developed an extensive oral and written 
tradition. The Vajrayana tradition (of 
India) was rather quickly exported, 
first to Central Asia, and later to 
Tibet and throughout East Asia. It is 
most readily seen today in the various 
schools of Tibetan Buddhism and the 
Shingon tradition of Japanese Buddhism."

"In Buddhist tradition, the principles

the basic evil of Desire) to the 
recognized goal of Buddhist endeavour, 
viz. complete enlightenment. Buddhist 
ethic thus favours those attitudes and 
kinds of behaviour which help humanity 
towards the ultimate goal of 
transcendental enlightenment; as an 
intermediate criterion, the goal of 
auspicious and wholesome rebirth (in a 
Pure Land) is important: whatever is 
conducive to this end is to be

encouraged; whatever detracts is to be 
discouraged or renounced. The outworking
 of the Buddhist ethic is seen at the

<xa>EUROPE</xa>
<_-xa>France</_-xa>; <_-xa>Germany</_-xa>; <_-xa>North America (Buddhism In)</_-xa>

"Buddhism was born as an object of 
western knowledge rather late in the 
Oriental Renaissance (which Schwab dates
 from 1680 to 1880). The sustained study
 of Buddhist texts did not really begin 
in Europe until the delivery of Brian 
Hodgson's package of Sanskrit 
manuscripts into the hands of Eugene 
Burnouf in 1837. (Hodgson was the 
Assistant Resident for the United 
Kingdom in Nepal). By this time 
Friedrich Schlegel had already 
proclaimed that 'everything, yes, 
everything without exception, has its 
origin in India.' But Buddhism remained 
largely excluded from the enthusiasm for
 Indian wisdom... Burnouf would not 
<pb n="679"/>
publish his Introduction a l'Histoire du
 Bouddhisme Indien until 1844; his 
translation of the Lotus Sutra did not 
appear until 1852, the year of his death
. By the time these and other works 
gained currency, the wave of enthusiasm 
for things Indian had largely passed, 
especially in Britain and France, 
although it continued in Germany into 
the present century. The brief period 
during which India replaced Egypt as the
 putative source of civilization was 
over; by the middle of the nineteenth 
century, both had been demoted in favor 
of Greece. Buddhist Studies, then, began
 as a latecomer to Romantic Orientalism,
 an offshoot of Indology at a time when 
India was no longer in vogue. Indeed, 
the portrayals of China and India as 
abodes of reason and spirit, 
respectively, which had been popular 
during the Enlightenment and the 
Romantic period, had begun to be 
displaced by 1800, before the Opium War 
of 1839 and the Indian Mutiny of 1857. 
India and China were now considered to 
be corrupt and effete civilizations, 
precisely at the time the European 
powers were undertaking their conquest. 
It was in this milieu that Buddhism was 
<pb n="680"/>
'created' in Europe."

Philip Almond in the British Discovery 
of Buddhism:
(To Westerners), "Buddhism, by 1860, had
 come to exist, not in the Orient, but 
in the Oriental libraries and institutes
 of the West, in its texts and 
manuscripts, at the desks of the Western
 savants who interpreted it. It had 
become a textual object, defined, 
classified, and interpreted through its 
own textuality. By the middle of the 
century, the Buddhism that existed 'out 
there' was beginning to be judged by a 
West that alone knew what Buddhism was, 
is, and ought to be. The essence of 
Buddhism came to be seen as expressed 
not 'out there' in the Orient, but in 
the West through the control of Buddhism
's own textual past."




<xa>EUTHANASIA，安樂死</xa>
<_-xa>Suicide</_-xa>; <_-xa>Killing</_-xa>

What is the Buddhist attitude on
(this) problem? Like almost all other 
<pb n="681"/>
major religions, Buddhism does not 
condone any act that results in the 
deprivation of life of any living being.
 This is more so with regard to cases 
involving human beings ... According to 
Buddhism, the whole (human) existence is
 suffering, (Dukka/ q.v.) of which 
illness is only one aspect. Death is 
only a violent break in this continuous 
process, and brings about only a 
temporary end to suffering which is 
bound to recur with the next birth (
unless all bad Karma has been 
extinguished).
(Encyclopedia of Buddhism, Volume 5: p. 
172)
"My (Roshi P. Kapleau, a well known Zen 
teacher) own feeling is that the same 
considerations apply to euthanasia as to
 other modes of life-taking. If the 
sufferer intentionally ends his own life
, he is committing suicide and must one 
day face all that entails in terms of 
karmic retribution. In the same way, 
someone who enables the sufferer to die,
 even by request, is culpable, although 
the mind state in which such an act is 
performed vitally affects the resulting 
karma. Nagging questions remain. Is it 
not selfish to be thinking of one's own 
<pb n="682"/>
karma when someone dear to you, 
terminally ill and in excruciating pain,
 implores you to end his or her life? 
But then , might not a refusal to 
respond to the patient's entreaties be 
kinder, karmically speaking, since the 
sufferer's karma is also involved? In 
any case, would a sufferer who 
understood the meaning of pain and its 
relation to karma -- that is, the 
grateful acceptance of pain as a means 
of paying karmic debts -- ask for 
euthanasia?" 
"Orthodox Jewry -- out of deep religious
 belief ... stands in adamant opposition
 to assisted suicide. So do most 
Protestants. The Southern Baptist 
Convention, evangelical Christians and 
the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod have 
been among the most vocal. But it is the
 Roman Catholic Church--by virtue of its
 hierarchal structure, sheer numbers and
 an extensive theology on the sanctity 
of life -that commands a dominant role. 
It is basic to Catholic teaching that 
human life is formed in the image and 
likeness of God ... so the value of a 
human life is not a matter of human 
choice or convenience."

"There is no term in Buddhist usage 
which exactly corresponds to the term '
evil' in Western religious usage; the 
nearest is dukkha, variously translated 
as 'ill,' 'suffering', '
unsatisfactoriness,' 'evil.' Buddhist 
thought on the subject of evil does not 
concern itself with origins; the fact of
 evil inclinations and attitudes is 
recognised, the reality of evil is 
affirmed, and the way to overcoming and 
negating such evil is proclaimed. In 
Buddhist thought, evil is most 
characteristically seen in its three 
basic roots: greed, hatred and illusion 
(delusion). The degree to which these 
factors are present in the human mind in
 varying degrees and combinations 
determines from moment to moment the '
given' situation in which a human 
individual acts." 
"Buddhism is not dualistic, and, 
therefore, does not divide phenomena 
into absolute 'good' or 'evil'. It 
recognizes 'evil' as ' limitation, and, 
<pb n="685"/>
therefore, purely relative. There is 
therefore no 'problem of Evil' as in 
theistic systems of thought. A11 evil is
 traced to desire for self. The 'basic 
evil' is the idea of separateness, and 
the Buddhist goal is the removal of evil
 by the eradication of every selfish 
inclination."

. Patriarch Shan-tao states, however, 
that its purpose is not to exclude

Buddha), fearing that we would commit 
these two kinds of faults (Cardinal Sins
 and slandering the Dharma), seeks to 
stop us by declaring that we will then 
not be able to attain birth in the Pure

<xa>EXCLUSIVE</xa>

"Exclusive Practice consists of the body

the mouth exclusively repeating the 
Buddha's name, and the mind focussing 
exclusively on the Buddha's name. Out of
 ten thousand cultivators who practice 
in such a manner, ten thousand are 
assured of rebirth in the Pure Land. 
Sundry Practices entail engaging in 
various methods of cultivation while 
<pb n="687"/>
dedicating the merits accrued toward 
rebirth in the Western Land. Since the 
practitioner's mind is not focussed or 
singleminded, it is difficult to 
accumulate merits. Thus, only three or 
four out of hundreds of thousands can 
hope to achieve rebirth in the Pure Land
. These are true, golden words of advice
, immutable throughout the ages. Both of
 you should follow them for your own 
benefit and in counselling everyone else
. Reciting mantras, too, should be 
considered an ancillary practice, rather
 than a principal method along with 
Buddha Recitation. The merits derived 
from mantra recitation are indeed 
inconceivable. However, ordinary people 
who achieve rebirth in the Pure Land owe
 it entirely to utterly sincere Faith 
and Vows, as these correspond to the 
lofty Vows of Amitabha Buddha" (

Pratimoksa), for which the prescribed 
penalty is permanent expulsion from the 
Order (Sangha): sexual misconduct, theft
, murder and boasting of supernatural 
powers.
For offenses of a serious nature other 
than these, the offender may be 
temporarily suspended, with the prospect
 of readmission later, if found worthy. 
It will be noted that there is no 
excommunication on grounds of heretical 
beliefs." 
NOTE: 
Heretical beliefs from the Buddhist

delusion (ignorance) and as such will 
disappear once wisdom develops through

<pb n="689"/>
<xa>EXISTENCE</xa>
<_-xa>Pure Land Buddhism (summary)</_-xa>;
 <_-xa>Four Propositions</_-xa>

The existence or non-existence of the 
Pure Land is a question, the answer to 
which depends on the practitioner and 
his level of cultivation. Consider the 
following exchange between two Zen monks
:
Disciple: "Master, does the Pure Land 
exist?"/
Monk: "Does this world exist?"/
Disciple: "Of course it does, Master. "/
Monk: "If this world exists, then the 
Pure Land exists all the more."
Buddha Sakyamuni taught that we are all 
living in a big Dream. Within this Birth
 and Death Dream, everything, ourselves 
and all dharmas exist. In this sense, 
the Pure Land also exists. This is not 
unlike a child who has no chocolate at 
all dreaming of receiving, for example, 
ten boxes of chocolates. If upon "
awakening," he finds himself with even 
one box, it can only mean that he is 
still dreaming. Otherwise, there should 
be no box of chocolates at all, as 
everything was just a dream. Likewise, 
when we still grasp at the self and 
<pb n="690"/>
still see this world as existent, we are
 still dreaming the big Dream and 
therefore everything, including the Pure
 Land, exists. Only those sages and 
saints who have transcended all notion 
of self and dharmas can proclaim that 
there is no Pure Land. 
Qyestions/answers
Zen Master Chu Hung (l6th century):
I. "Some people say that the Pure Land 
is nothing but mind, that there is no 
Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss beyond the 
trillions of worlds of the cosmos. This 
talk of mind-only has its source in the 
words of the sutras, and is true, not 
false. But those who quote it in this 
sense are misunderstanding its meaning. 
Mind equals objects: there are no 
objects beyond mind. Objects equal mind:
 there is no mind beyond objects. Since 
objects are wholly mind, why must we 
cling to mind and dismiss objects? Those
 who dismiss objects when they talk of 
mind have not comprehended mind."
II. "Some people say: 'To see the Buddha
 is to see the Buddha of the Self-Nature
, not the Buddha of the Western Pure 
Land.' This being the case, at the time 
of death, is it the Buddha of the Self-
Nature who appears, or is it Buddha 
<pb n="691"/>
Amitabha who comes to receive and guide 
us?
Answer: Seeing the Buddha at the time of
 death is due to our own Self-Nature, 
which has elicited a response from 
Amitabha Buddha. You should not revert 
everything to the Self-Nature and think 
that there is no Buddha Amitabha 
arriving to receive and guide you!" (
Master Zhuhong, in J.C. Cleary, tr., 
Pure Land, Pure Mind.) 
NOTE:
"In secular western thought, awareness 
of psychological projection as a source 
of supernatural being has served to 
demythologize demons, goblins, angels 
and saints and rob them of their power. 
The Bardo Thodol (Tibetan Book of the 
Dead), however, speaks of the deities as
 'projections' but never as 'mere 
projections.' The deities are present 
and must be dealt with religiously ... 
not just by intellectual insight." (D.G.
 Dawe in The Perennial Dictionary of 
World Religions, p. 93.)

Please read entry "Emptiness" before the
 following:
"The True Mind (True Nature) is an 
immensely broad and extensive state, 
encompassing an untold number of lands, 
Buddhas and sentient beings. In that One
 True State, the aspect of lands and 
sentient beings, constantly in flux, 
pertains to the 'Dharma Door (school) of
 Birth and Death.' The silent and 
illuminating aspect -- still, wonderful,
 clear, bright and everlasting - is 
called the 'Dharma Door (school) of True
 Thusness.' The True Mind or True Nature
 is a Common True State encompassing 
those two Doors ... The Buddha taught 
two approaches for returning to that 
True Nature. Such methods as Zen, T'ien 
T'ai (Tendai School) and a division of 
the Esoteric School enter it through the
 Dharma Door of Emptiness. Other schools
, such as the Pure Land School, the 
Avatamsaka School, the Vinaya (

Diamond Division of the Esoteric School

Existence. Therefore, those who deeply

from form, form is emptiness, emptiness 
is form. On the other hand, those who 
lack thorough understanding will cling 
to emptiness unless they cling to 
existence. However, clinging to 
existence at least makes the 
practitioner fear cause and effect, 
avoid transgressions and perform good 
deeds, which leads to auspicious rebirth
 in human and celestial realms -- or in 
the Western Pure Land (in the case of 
diligent practitioners of Buddha 
Recitation). On the other hand, if he 
clings to emptiness, he will end up 
denigrating cause and effect and 
rejecting the Buddhas and sages. Thus, 
he will descend, in the future, upon the
 Three Evil Paths. Therefore, the 
ancients have cautioned: 'It is better 
to be attached to existence, though the 
attachment may be as great as Mount 
Sumeru, than to be attached to emptiness
, though the attachment may be as small 
as a mustard seed.'" (Thich Thien Tam)

D.T. Suzuki quotes the Zen Patriarch Fa 
Yen as follows:
"The sutras preached by the Buddha 
during his lifetime are said to amount 
to five thousand and forty-eight 
fascicles; they include the doctrine of 
emptiness and the doctrine of being (
existence); there are teachings of 
immediate realization and of gradual 
development. Is it not an affirmation?
"But, according to (Zen Master Yung Chia
 in his Song of Enlightenment), 'there 
are no sentient beings, there are no 
Buddhas; sages as numerous as the sands 
of the Ganges are but so many bubbles in
 the sea; sages and worthies of the past
 are like flashes of lightning.' Is this
 not a negation?
"O you, my disciples, if you say there 
is, you go against (Yung Chia); if you 
say there is not, you contradict our old
 master Buddha. If he were with us, then
 how would he pass through the dilemma? 
... If you confess your ignorance, I 
will let you see into the secret. When I
 say there is not, this does not 
necessarily mean a negation; when I say 
there is, this also does not signify an 
affirmation. Turn eastward and look at 
the Western Land; face the south and the
<pb n="695"/>
 North Star is pointed out there!"

A. "Temporary or provisional teachings 
as a means to lead sentient beings to 
the final doctrine. B. The seventh of 
the ten Paramitas (q.v.)." 
Refers to strategies, methods, devices 
targeted to the capacities, 
circumstances, likes and dislikes of 
each sentient being, so as to rescue him
 and lead him to Enlightenment. "All 
particular formulations of the Teaching 
are just provisional expedients to 
communicate the Truth (Dharma) in 
specific contexts" (J.C. Cleary). "The. 
Buddha's words were medicines for a 
given sickness at a given time," always 
infinitely adaptable to the conditions 
of the audience. 
"The practice of skillful means is the 
<pb n="696"/>
Buddhist approach to teaching the Dharma
. Each method (Pure Land, Zen ...) 'has 
its own area of emphasis. Those who 
advocate a Dharma door direct all 
expedient teaching toward that method.' 
(Master 'Thich Thien Tam, Buddhism of 
Wisdom and Faith, Preface.)"
(I) Unfavorable expedients 
An expedient which at first sight seems 
adverse but which in fact serves to 
awaken the practitioner to the Truth, 
for example, of Impermanence. See the 
following passage from a Zen text, the 
Vimalakirti Sutra:
"They (Bodhisattvas) demonstrate the 
burning of the earth/ In the consuming 
flames of the world's end,/ In order to 
demonstrate impermanence/ To living 
beings with the notion of permanence... 
They play with illusory manifestations/ 
In order to develop living beings,/ 
showing themselves to be old or sick,/ 
And even manifesting their own deaths." 
(Robert Thurman, tr.) 
A severe illness, a sudden death or even
 loss of a job may sometimes jolt the 
practitioner out of his usual 
complacency and remind him of the need 
to cultivate. Note: whether an 
unfavorable event is good or bad for one
<pb n="697"/>
's cultivation depends, in the final 
analysis, on one's own outlook, one's 
mind. It can be either an expedient, to 
help one attain the Way or a "demon " 
hindering cultivation (See also: 
Buddhism of Wisdom and Faith, section 63
, para. 4). 
Feigning shortcomings and weaknesses is 
a common expedient of leading disciples 
of Sakyamuni Buddha. For example, Ananda
 was allegedly "lured" into the house of
 the most beautiful courtesan of Vaisali
, thus providing the setting for the 
Surangama Sutra. In this key Mahayana 
text, the Buddha warned cultivators of 
the various temptations and obstructions
 to be expected on the way to 
Enlightenment. Following this example, 
some monks and nuns at times expediently
 confess to various transgressions they 
did not actually commit. This is for the
 express purpose of providing the 
assembly with an opportunity to learn 
and grow. These instances, albeit rare, 
reflect the essence of Bodhisattva 
practice. 
(II)One/Many Teachings
<_-xa>the following passage from D.T. 
Suzuki:</_-xa>
"Buddhist theology has a fine 
<pb n="698"/>
comprehensive theory to explain the 
manifold types of experience in Buddhism
, which look so contradictory to each 
other. In fact the history of Chinese 
Buddhism is a series of attempts to 
reconcile the diverse schools ... 
Various ways of classification and 
reconciliation were offered, and ... 
their conclusion was this: Buddhism 
supplies us with so many gates to enter 
into the truth because of such a variety
 of human characters and temperaments 
and environments due to diversities of 
karma. This is plainly depicted and 
taught by the Buddha himself when he 
says that the same water drunk by the 
cow and the cobra turns in one case into
 nourishing milk and in the other into 
deadly poison, and that medicine is to 
be given according to disease. This is 
called the doctrine of (skillful) means 
..." (The Eastern Buddhist Vol. 4, No. 2
, p.121.)

A question that arises is how two 
methods seemingly so opposite as Pure 
Land and Zen can lead to the same goal 
of Buddhahood. As an analogy, supposing 
a patient is admitted to the hospital 
with a high fever. The physician will, 
<pb n="699"/>
of course, prescribe a medication to 
lower the fever. However, if later in 
the day, her temperature has dropped to 
a dangerously low level, he will attempt
 to raise it with another prescription. 
The immediate goal is different in each 
case, but the ultimate goal in both is 
the same: to normalize the temperature 
of the patient. The Buddha, as the 
master physician, likewise employs 84,
000 methods to treat the 84,000 
afflictions of sentient beings."
"Studying Zen, Buddha Recitation, even 
reading and reciting sutras, all are 
aids in the path toward seeing the Way. 
They are like the staves that travelers 
use to aid them in their journeys. (Zen 
Master Hakuin 1685-1768)" 
Another interpretation is that the 
teachings themselves are not simplified,
 but rather the audience was not ready 
to understand them to the full extent. 
As an analogy, the rain may fall equally
 on big trees and small but the larger 
ones absorb more water. 
Even when the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 
are depicted as providing material 
assistance to the believer, this is 
always viewed as an "expedient means" --
 the ultimate goal is to lead the 
<pb n="700"/>
believer to Enlightenment.
(III) Self Benefit/ Other-Benefit
See the following explanation of the 
expression "skillful means are the 
ultimate" as seen by Kukai (774-835), 
the founder of the Japanese Shingon, or 
Esoteric, school: "Kukai interpreted 
this phrase in two ways. One stresses 
the imperative sense that skillful means
 should lead to ultimate enlightenment. 
The other emphasizes the declarative 
sense that skillful means themselves are
 the ultimate. The former expresses the 
view of self-benefit in seeking 
enlightenment, and the latter, the view 
of enlightenment fulfilled in compassion
 toward others." 
(IV) Note 
The Treatise on the Awakening of the 
Faith specifically recommends Buddha 
Recitation for all but the most advanced
 practitioners: "Next, suppose there is 
a man who learns this (Mahayana) 
teaching for the first time and wishes 
to seek the correct faith but lacks 
courage and strength. Because he lives 
in this world of suffering, he fears 
that he will not always be able to meet 
the Buddhas and honor them personally, 
and that, faith being difficult to 
<pb n="701"/>
perfect, he will be inclined to fall 
back. He should know that the 
Tathagathas have an excellent expedient 
means by which they can protect his 
faith: that is, through the strength of 
wholehearted meditation-recitation on 
the Buddha, he will in fulfillment of 
his wishes be able to be born in the 
Buddha-land beyond, to see the Buddha 
always, and to be forever separated from
 the evil states of existence... " (
Asvaghosha, The Awakening of the Faith, 
p.102.)

</_-xa>; <_-xa>Awakening of the Faith 
Treatise</_-xa>

"Faith (Pali/ saddha; Skt/ sraddha) has 
an important place in the Buddhist 
scheme, both at the entry upon the 
Buddhist way, and in perseverance in the
 way. Faith is said to be a factor 
associated with any karmically wholesome
 state of consciousness whatsoever, at 
any stage of the religious life... The 
centrality of Saving Faith is notably 
developed in the treatise Awakening of 
the Faith in the Mahayana, which has had
 an immense influence in East Asian 
Buddhism. There it is argued that '
fundamental' faith is a joyous 
recollection of 'Suchness' (chen ju). 
Such fundamental faith is finally 
<pb n="706"/>
attained inter alia through the 
limitless merits of Buddha, resulting in
 worshipping and reverencing him..." 
"Sakyamuni Buddha is said to have saved 
himself 'by his own efforts alone', and 
this streak of spiritual self-help runs 
right through Buddhism. You will still 
hear people today saying, 'You have to 
do it for yourself -- no one else can do
 it for you', which is correct, but not 
altogether true. For faith and devotion 
perennially arise within the human heart
, faith signifying belief that an 
external agency can help the individual 
spiritually, and devotion a deep 
gratitude for the source of that help. 
There have been such elements in 
Buddhism from the earliest times. To 
practice within the Buddhist tradition 
is in fact to display faith (though 
hopefully not blind faith) in that 
tradition. To bow before an image of a 
Buddha or Bodhisattva, a teacher or a 
monk or nun is to show both faith and 
devotion. So is to light incense, to 
copy or recite the scriptures, to carve 
images, to endow temples and monasteries
, to feed the Sangha, and so on. Such 
practices grew as the religion itself 
developed, particularly during the 
<pb n="707"/>
Mahayana phase of its development. An 
important early devotional practice was 
that of buddhanusmrti or 'Recollection 
of the Buddha'. This is done by bringing
 the Buddha to mind, reciting his name, 
and by visualizing his image and/or his 
Pure Land or field of activity, which 
might be either a physical or a 
transcendental 'place' depending upon 
the sophistication of the individual 
view. It is also possible to go beyond 
recollection of the Buddha as a physical
 being to a more formless kind of 
recollection. The benefits to be derived
 from such practices are considerable. 
One might have a vision of the Buddha, 
or attain profound meditative states." 
The concept of faith is very important 
in all Buddhist schools -- Zen, Pure 
Land and Tantric alike. See the 
following quote from D.T. 
"A thoroughgoing enlightenment is 
attained only through the most self-
sacrificing application of the mind, 
supported by an inflexible faith in the 
finality of Zen ... The necessary 
requirements are faith and personal 
effort, without which Zen is a mere 
bubble." (Suzuki, An Introduction to Zen
 Buddhism:115) 
<pb n="708"/>
Faith In Pure Laud Buddhism
"A tradition in Buddhism beginning with 
the Pure Land sutras, and developing 
into formal traditions in virtually all 
Buddhist cultures in East Asia. Upon the
 development of the Larger and Smaller 
Amitabha Sutras and the Meditation Sutra
, the notion of putting one's confidence
, or more precisely, faith, in the 
saving grave of Amitabha Buddha became 
important in Indian Buddhism. This faith
 is expressed by the Sanskrit formula '
Namo Amitabha Buddha,' literally 'Homage
 to Amitabha Buddha.' As the Buddhist 
tradition moved into China, this 
practice of placing faith in Amitabha 
Buddha became even more popular, and the
 ritual formula became the basis of 
religious practice in the Chinese Pure 
Land school (known as Ching-t'u/Tinh-Do.
)" 
The Avatamsaka Sutra teaches: "Faith is 
the basis of the Path the mother of 
virtues Nourishing and growing all good 
ways... Faith can assure arrival at 
enlightenment." (T.Cleary, tr. The 
Flower Ornament:I/331.)
"Therefore, Faith is of great importance
 to the cultivator. If we lose Faith, 
not only will our base for progress in 
<pb n="709"/>
the Way crumble, but none of our 
liberating deeds will succeed. This 
Faith is not blind faith, but is Faith 
grounded in wisdom, based entirely on 
the words of the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas 
and Patriarchs, as taught in the sutras.
 Why is it that after relying on wisdom,
 we should still put our complete Faith 
in the teachings of the sages? It is 
because the Pure Land method, belonging 
as it does to the Mahayana tradition, is
 concerned with many transcendental 
realms beyond human knowledge or wisdom.
 Therefore, there are many realities 
that ordinary sentient beings cannot 
readily understand. Once, when Buddha 
Sakyamuni was lecturing on the Lotus 
Sutra at the Vulture Peak Assembly, five
 thousand great Sravakas (Hearers), many
 of whom were Arhats, did not believe 
His words and left the Assembly. Even 
these venerable Sravakas endowed with 
transcendental wisdom had doubts about 
the Dharma preached by Buddha Sakyamuni 
Himself. We can see, then, that Mahayana
 teachings are not easy to understand 
and believe. For this reason, there are 
many passages in the Mahayana sutras in 
which Buddha Sakyamuni requested that 
such and such a teaching not be preached
<pb n="710"/>
 indiscriminately to those without Faith
 and with too many view-attachments, 
lest they develop slanderous thoughts 
and reap evil karma. When the Mahayana 
doctrine began to spread widely, the 
ancient sages, too, admonished Buddhist 
followers to adopt the following 
approach to studying Mahayana sutras: 
Understand with your mind those passages
 that you can. As for those passages 
which you cannot fully comprehend 
through reflection, just put your Faith 
entirely in the words of the Buddhas. 
That is the only way to avoid the 
offense of vilifying the great Dharma 
and losing merits and virtues thereby."

"According to the sutras and 
commentaries, the Pure Land practitioner
 should follow three guidelines to 
consolidate his faith.
I. THE GUIDELINE OF REASON.
This is the reasoning and understanding 
of human logic. For example, we may 
reflect: All realms are created from the
 mind. If there is a world such as ours,
 where good karma and bad karma are 
about equal, there must exist other 
worlds such as the Three Evil Paths, 
with a preponderance of evil karma, as 
<pb n="711"/>
well as celestial realms, where good 
karma prevails. It therefore stands to 
reason that the Western Pure Land exists
, as a result of the pure, good Vows of 
Amitabha Buddha as well as the virtues 
of the Bodhisattvas and other morally 
superior beings.
2. THE GUIDELINE OF THE TEACHINGS OF THE
 SAGES. 
These are the words of the Buddhas and 
Bodhisattvas in sutras and commentaries.
 Buddha Sakyamuni, with his pure vision,
 clearly saw the auspicious environment 
and superior beings of the Western Pure 
Land and described them in the Pure Land
 sutras. The great Bodhisattvas, such as
 Manjusri and Samantabhadra, all 
extolled the Land of Ultimate Bliss and 
enjoined sentient beings to seek rebirth
 there. If Buddhists are not guided by 
the words of the Buddhas and 
Bodhisattvas, whom then should they 
believe?
3. THE GUIDELINE OF ACTUAL SEEING AND 
UNDERSTANDING. 
This is a method of reasoning based on 
actual occurrences, verifiable through 
our eyes and understanding. The 
commentary, Biographies of Pure Land 
Sages and Saints, has amply documented 
<pb n="712"/>
the stories of individuals who have 
achieved rebirth in the Land of Ultimate
 Bliss through Buddha Recitation... 
Moreover, those who have practiced 
Buddha Recitation with a pure mind have 
been known to witness scenes of the Pure
 Land during their current lifetimes. I 
(Master Thich Thien-Tam) have described 
above three guidelines that Pure Land 
practitioners should follow to 
consolidate their faith. Moreover, 
according to Elder Master Yin Kuang, 
Pure Land followers should not seek 
guidance on Pure Land matters from Zen 
Masters. This is because the answer of 
Zen Masters are all directed towards 
principle and essence, while the Pure 
Land approach is based on phenomena and 
marks. This being the case, and 
considering the different areas of 
emphasis, beginning Pure Land 
practitioners who do not yet fully 
understand essence and marks, noumenon 
and phenomena, will not only fail to 
benefit from the answers of Zen Masters,
 they may develop even greater doubts, 
perplexity and inconsistent views." 
NOTES 
(1) "There is even a place in the 
Western Paradise for the worst sinners. 
<pb n="713"/>
The Meditation Sutra relates that even 
if a person has commited the Five or Ten
 Cardinal Sins, if this sinner has faith
 in Amitabha Buddha and earnestly 
recites His name ten times on his 
deathbed, a lotus throne will appear and
 will bear him to the lowest stage in 
the Pure Land -- the lowest birth of the
 lowest degree (see Lotus Grades). 
Instead of being condemned ..., the 
sinner will be born in the Western 
Paradise in a closed lotus flower ... 
This teaching of the nine possible 
levels of birth was an extremely 
effective way to reward good deeds on 
earth while still offering the promise 
of salvation to all, regardless of how 
much merit they had accumulated." (
Okazaki , Pure Land Buddhist Painting) 
(2) Utter complete Faith, or Utter 
Sincerity, or Single-mindedness, or One 
Pointedness of Mind: in practice, these 
expressions are used interchangeably, as
 a cultivator cannot have utter complete
 faith without being utterly sincere and
 singleminded (and vice versa). 
The kind of utter, complete, 
unquestionable faith spoken of in the 
Pure Land sutras may be illustrated by 
the famous example of the monk who, to 
<pb n="714"/>
guard against falling asleep, would 
practice meditation seated at the edge 
of a high cliff. One moment of 
inattention would send him tumbling to 
his death. According to the Meditation 
Sutra, the practioner, on his deathbed 
must have this utmost level of sincerity
 to ensure his rebirth in the Pure Land.

<xa>FAITH</xa>
<_-xa>Spirit World</_-xa>; <_-xa>Mediums</_-xa>

"The practice of faith-healing is 
prevalent in many countries. Many people
 are trying to influence the public 
through emotional persuasion designated 
as faith-healing. In order to impress on
 their patients the efficacy of their 
healing powers, some faith-healers use 
the name of a god or a religious object 
to introduce a religious flavour into 
their faith-healing methods. The 
introduction of religion into faith-
healing is actually a guise or decoy to 
beguile the patient into developing more
<pb n="715"/>
 devotion -- and enhance the confidence 
or faith of the patient in the faith-
healer. This healing act, if performed 
in public, is intended to bring converts
 to a particular religious denomination.
 In actual fact, insofar as faith-
healing is concerned, religion is not 
all that important. There are numerous 
cases of faith-healers performing their 
faith healing acts without using 
religion at all. A case in point is the 
science of hypnotism, the practice of 
which involves no religious aspects at 
all. Those who associate religion with 
faith-healing are engaging in a subtle 
form of illusion, trying to attract 
converts to their particular religion by
 making use of faith healing and 
describing certain cures as miraculous 
acts. The methods employed by faith 
healers are to condition the minds of 
patients into having a certain mental 
attitude with the result that certain 
favourable psychological and 
physiological changes invariably take 
place. This improves the condition of 
the mind, the heart, the consequent 
blood circulation and other related 
organic functions of the body, thus 
creating a sense of well-being. If 
<pb n="716"/>
sickness is attributed to the condition 
of the mind, then the mind can certainly
 be properly conditioned to assist in 
eradicating whatever illness may occur. 
In this context, it is to be noted that 
the constant and regular practice of 
meditation can help to minimize, if not 
completely eradicate, various forms of 
illnesses. There are many discourses in 
the Teaching of the Buddha where it is 
indicated that various forms of sickness
 were eradicated through the 
conditioning of the mind. Thus it is 
worthwhile to practice meditation (and/
or Buddha Recitation) in order to attain
 mental and physical well-being." 



<xa>FAITH--VOWS--PRACTICE，信願行</xa>
<_-xa>Devotion</_-xa>; <_-xa>Vows / Rebirth
 in Pure Land</_-xa>; <_-xa>Pure Land 
School</_-xa>; <_-xa>Provisions for Pure 
Land Rebirth</_-xa>

Three factors, Faith, Vows and Practice,
 are the cornerstones of Pure Land 
Buddhism. If they are present, rebirth 
in the Pure Land is assured.
"Faith" means faith in Amitabha Buddha's
<pb n="717"/>
 Vows to rescue all who recite His name,
 as well as faith in one's own self-
nature, which is intrinsically the same 
as His (to recite the Buddha's name is 
to recite / remember the Mind). 'vows" 
are the determination to be reborn in 
the Pure Land -- in one's pure mind -- 
so as to be in a position to save 
oneself and others.
"Practice" generally means reciting the 
Buddha's name to the point where one's 
mind and that of Amitabha Buddha are in 
unison -- i.e., to the point of single-
mindedness. Samadhi and wisdom are then 
achieved. Please note that all Buddhist 
teachings are expedient means (q.v.), 
dividing the one and indivisible Truth 
into many parts. Faith, Vows and 
Practice, although three, are really one
. Thus, it can be said that rebirth in 
the. Pure Land depends on three 
conditions or two conditions (faith and 
vows) or even one condition (faith), as 
the one contains all and all are 
contained in one. The formula to be used
 depends on the audience and the times. 
The aim is to enable sentient beings to 
achieve rebirth in the Pure Land as a 
steppingstone toward Buddhahood. 
For heuristic reasons, Dharma Masters 
<pb n="718"/>
explain Faith, Vows and Practice 
separately, emphasizing the crucial 
nature of each one. However, these three
 preconditions for rebirth in the Pure 
Land are one and indivisible. True Faith
 naturally leads to Vows and Practice, 
while correct Practice cannot exist 
independent of Faith and Vows.
As the Patriarch Yin Kuang once wrote: "
The true Pure Land practitioner always 
fully combines the three criteria of 
Faith, Vows and Practice during 
recitation. He is like an infant longing
 for his mother. When, lonely and crying
, he searches for her; he certainly 
never lacks Faith or the desire (Vow) to
 see her. Therefore, why do you ask 
whether 'Vows and Practices come 
separately or together?'" 
NOTE:
"Elder Master Ou I, the ninth Pure Land 
patriarch, has said, 'To be reborn in 
the Pure Land or not depends entirely 
upon Faith and Vows; the grade of 
rebirth (high or low) depends on whether
 one's Practice is deep or shallow.' He 
further added
, 'Without Faith and Vows, you cannot be
 reborn, even if you recite the Buddha's
 name to the point where neither the 
<pb n="719"/>
blowing wind nor the falling rain can 
penetrate and your recitation is as 
solid as a bronze wall or an iron gate.'
 Those who practice Buddha Recitation 
assiduously but lack Faith and Vows will
 merely obtain the merits and blessings 
of the human and celestial realms, 
according to their level of cultivation.
 When their blessings are exhausted they
 are once again subject to birth and 
death ..." (Master Thich Thien Tam, 
Buddhism of Wisdom and Faith, sect 21)

<pb n="720"/>

Proclaiming the errors of others, 
whether true or not, is an offense for 
two main reasons: i) the mind of the "
proclaimer" is no longer empty and still
, but tarnished by dislike or scorn, and
 ii) the "transgressor" and those who 
hear of the errors may grow discouraged,
 abandon further cultivation and 
retrogress -- thus, potential Buddhas 
are lost. 
"According to the Brahma Net and 
Avatamsaka Sutras, we should ignore 
appearances and external forms when 
seeking a good spiritual advisor. For 
example, we should disregard such traits
 as youth, poverty, low status or lack 
of education, unattractive appearance or
 incomplete features, but should simply 
seek someone conversant with the Dharma,
 who can be of benefit to us. Nor should
 we find fault with good spiritual 
advisors for acting in certain ways, as 
it may be due to a number of reasons, 
such as pursuing a hidden cultivation 
practice or following an expedient 
teaching. Or else, they may act the way 
they do because while their achievements
 may be high, their residual bad habits 
have not been extinguished. If we grasp 
<pb n="721"/>
at forms and look for faults, we will 
forfeit benefits on the path of 
cultivation. Thus, when Buddha Sakyamuni
 was still alive, the Bhikshu Kalodayin 
was in the habit of moving his jaws like
 a buffalo; a certain Bhikshuni used to 
look at herself in the mirror and adorn 
herself; another Bhikshu liked to climb 
trees and jump from one branch to 
another; still another always addressed 
others in a loud voice, with 
condescending terms and appellations. In
 truth, however, all four had reached 
the stage of Arhatship. It is just that 
one of them was a buffalo in a previous 
life, another was a courtesan, another 
was a monkey, and still another belonged
 to the Brahman class. They were 
accustomed to these circumstances 
throughout many lifetimes, so that even 
when they had attained the fruits of 
Arhatship, their residual habits still 
lingered. We also have the example of 
the Sixth Patriarch. Realizing that the 
cultivators of his day were attached to 
a literal reading of the sutras and did 
not immediately recognize their Buddha 
Nature, he took the form of an ignorant 
and illiterate person selling wood in 
the marketplace. Therefore, finding a 
<pb n="722"/>
good spiritual advisor is a difficult 
task indeed! Students of the Dharma 
should realize this, to decrease the 
habits of attachment and grasping -- 
thus avoiding the mistake of maligning 
monks and nuns."

There are many kinds of 'fields of

Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Arhats and all 
sentient beings, whether friends or foes
, are fields of merits for the 
cultivator because they provide him with
 an opportunity to cultivate merits and 
virtues. For example, needy people 
provide the opportunity for the 
cultivator to practice charity. Thus, 
they are fields of merits for him. As 
the Avatamsaka Sutra (chapter 40) states
, "Bodhi (Enlightenment) belongs to 
living beings. Without living beings, no
 Bodhisattva could achieve Supreme, 
Perfect Enlightenment."

<xa>FIVE</xa>
<_-xa>Tien T'ai</_-xa>; <_-xa>Five 
Teachings</_-xa>

"In the centuries that followed the 
Buddha's death, various attempts were 
made to organize and formulate his 
teachings. Different systems appeared, 
basing themselves on the recorded 
<pb n="733"/>
scriptures, each purporting to express 
the Buddha's intended meaning... That 
there should be a multiplicity of 
systems is not in itself surprising. 
From the time of his enlightenment until
 his death fifty years later, the Buddha
 bestowed his teachings for the benefit 
of many different audiences. The purpose
 of his doctrine was always the same: to
 liberate beings from the round of 
suffering. The expression of this 
purpose, however, differed according to 
the capacity of his hearers. It is 
therefore to be expected that the body 
of teachings remaining after his 
departure from the world should be rich 
and varied...
In China, scholars made numerous 
attempts to organize the vast array of 
sutras which had been introduced from 
India into coherent systems.
The T'ien-T'ai system is called the Five
 Periods and Eight Teachings while the 
Avatamsaka classification is known as 
the Five Teachings (q.v.)."

Five Periods/ Eight Teachings 
All the teachings (Eight Teachings) of 
Buddha Sakyamuni during His entire 
lifetime (Five periods), as categorized 
<pb n="734"/>
by the T'ien-T'ai school (6th C.). 
(I)The Five Periods are: (1) The period 
of the Avatamsaka Sutra, which according
 to tradition was the first sutra 
Sakyamuni taught after attaining his 
enlightenment. With this teaching, the 
Buddha awoke his listeners to the 
greatness of Buddhism, though it was too
 profound for most of them to grasp. (2)
 The period of the Agama sutras. 
Perceiving that his disciples were not 
yet ready for the teachings of the 
Avatamsaka Sutra, Sakyamuni next 
expounded the Agama sutras as a means to
 develop it. These teachings reveal the 
truths of suffering, emptiness, 
impermanence and egolessness which free 
people from the six paths, and 
correspond to the Theravada teachings. (
3) The Vaipulya period, or period of the
 introductory Mahayana. In this period 
Sakyamuni refuted his disciples' 
attachment to the Lesser Vehicle and 
directed them toward provisional 
Mahayana with such teachings as the Maha
-Vairocana and Vimalakirti Sutras. (4) 
The Prajna period, or period of the 
Wisdom Sutras. In this period Sakyamuni 
expounded a higher level of provisional 
Mahayana and refuted his disciples' 
<pb n="735"/>
attachment to the distinction between 
Theravada and Mahayana by teaching the 
doctrine of non-substantiality or 
Emptiness. (5) The Nirvana period, in 
which he taught directly from his own 
enlightenment, fully revealing the truth
. The teachings of this period include 
the Lotus Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra. 
Note: The Avatamsaka period lasted for 
twenty-one days, the Agama period for 
twelve years, the Vaipulya period for 
eight years, the Prajna period for 
twenty-two years, and the Nirvana period
 for eight years." 
(II) The Eight Teachings organized 
Sakyamuni's teachings according to 
content and method. It actually consists
 of two subclassifications -- the four 
teachings of doctrine and the four 
teachings of method. The four teachings 
of doctrine is a classification by 
content and consists of the Tripitaka 
teaching, the Connecting teaching, the 
Specific teaching, and the Perfect 
teaching. The four teachings of method 
are a classification by method of 
teaching and consist of the Sudden 
Teaching, the Gradual Teaching, the 
Secret Teaching and the Indeterminate 
Teaching." (For details see Shambala 
<pb n="736"/>
Dictionary of Buddhism and Zen, p. 227).
 



<xa>FIVE</xa>
<_-xa>Precepts</_-xa>; <_-xa>Ethics</_-xa>

Five basic prohibitions binding on all 
Buddhists, monks and laymen alike. "
Traditionally, laymen should observe 
five precepts: (1) not to take life, (2)
 not to take what is not given to one, (
3) not to engage in improper sexual 
conduct, (4) not to lie, and (5) not to 
drink intoxicants." 
"In Buddhist tradition, the principles 
governing human conduct relate the 
characteristic condition of humanity (
suffering, unease, illness, caused by 
the basic evil of Desire) to the 
recognized goal of Buddhist endeavour, 
viz. complete enlightenment. Buddhist 
ethics thus favours those attitudes and 
kinds of behaviour which help humanity 
towards the ultimate goal of 
transcendental enlightenment. As an 
intermediate criterion, the goal of 
auspicious and wholesome rebirth (in a 
Pure Land) is important: whatever is 
<pb n="737"/>
conducive to this end is to be 
encouraged; whatever detracts is to be 
discouraged or renounced. The outworking
 of the Buddhist ethic is seen at the 
most elementary level in the 5 basic 
moral precepts, binding upon all 
Buddhists, monastic and lay." 
NOTE: 
According to Buddhist teaching, keeping 
the Five Precepts results in rebirth in 
human form, while keeping the Ten 
Precepts results in rebirth as a deva (
deity). Since the human and celestial 
realms are still subject to birth and 
death, however, rebirth there is not the
 goal of Pure Land Buddhists. They seek 
rebirth in the Land of Amitabha Buddha, 
a realm transcending birth and death.  
Anyone who keeps the five or ten 
precepts (basic moral prohibitions) 
reaps the rewards of human and celestial
 rebirth, respectively. Such a person 
need not be a Buddhist as these rewards 
are a corollary of the Law of Cause and 
Effect which the Buddha did not invent 
but merely discovered.



<xa>FIVE</xa>
<pb n="738"/>
Syn: <_-xa>Five Houses of Ch'an</_-xa>

"A generic term for the branches of the 
Southern school of Ch'an (Jpn/ Zen) 
Buddhism in China. The five are the Lin-
chi (Rinzai), Kuei-yang, Ts'ao-tung (
Soto), Yun-men and Fa-yen schools. These
 five plus the Huang-lung and Yang-ch'i 
schools which eventually broke away from
 the Lin-chi school are together called 
the seven schools. All of the Southern 
Zen schools trace their lineage to Hui-
neng (638-713), the sixth of the Chinese
 Zen patriarchs who received the 
transmission from Hung-jen, the fifth 
patriarch. Hui-neng propagated Zen in 
the Southern part of China; therefore 
his lineage is called the southern 
school of Zen. 
Another of patriot Hung-jen's disciples,
 Shen-hsiu (606-706), spread Zen 
Buddhism in northern China. His lineage,
 called the Northern school, (soon died 
out and was replaced by the Hui-neng 
School which became known as the Ch'an /

<_-xa>Five Periods and Eight Teachings (
Tien Tai school)</_-xa>

"A comparative classification of 
Buddhist sutras set forth by the 
Avatamsaka (Hua-yen/ Kegon) school. 
This classification was established by 
Fa-tsang (643-712) during the T'ang 
dynasty, the third patriarch of the Hua-
yen school. He categorized the sutras 
into five groups according to their 
level of teaching, and the Buddhist 
schools into ten according to the 
content of their doctrine. 
The five teachings are (1) the Theravada
, (2) the elementary Mahayana, (3) the 
final Mahayana, (4) the Sudden teaching 
and (5) the Perfect teaching. 'The 
Theravada teaching' corresponds to the 
Agama sutras. These teachings generally 
<pb n="740"/>
hold that the self is without substance,
 the separate elements (dharmas) are 
real, and Nirvana is their total 
annihilation. 
'The elementary Mahayana teaching' is 
divided into two. The first is the 
teaching which analyzes the specific and
 distinct character of the dharmas, and 
the second is the teaching that all 
dharmas are non-substantial (ku). The 
former is found in the Yogachara Sutra 
and the latter in the Wisdom Sutras.
'The final Malrayana teaching' maintains
 the essentially unchanging true nature 
of all things and the ability of all 
beings to attain Buddhahood. This 
teaching is found in the Lankavatara 
Sutra and the Awakening of the Faith.
'The Sudden teaching' expounds the 
abrupt realization of the ultimate truth
 without relying upon verbal 
explanations or progression through 
various stages of practice. This 
teaching is found in the Vimalakirti 
Sutra. 'The Perfect teaching' is taught 
by the Avatamsaka and Lotus Sutras which
 expound the One Vehicle (the Buddhas' 
vehicle)."
"The 'perfect teaching' is further 
divided into two: the One Vehicle (
<pb n="741"/>
Buddha vehicle) of the Identical 
Doctrine and the One Vehicle of the 
Distinct Doctrine. The former teaches 
the One Vehicle in a method identical or
 similar to that of the three vehicles (
Theravada, preliminary Mahayana and 
Sudden). This corresponds to the Lotus 
Sutra. The Distinct Doctrine on the 
other hand sets forth the One Vehicle as
 entirely distinct or separate from the 
other three. This corresponds to the 
Avatamsaka Sutra and is held to be 
superior the Identical Doctrine. Thus 
the Avatamsaka school asserts the 
superiority of the Avatamsaka over the 
Lotus Sutra." 
NOTE: Pure Land Buddhism
"Han-shan (q.v.) did not write any 
commentary on the (two Amitabha Sutras),
 and it is not clear how he placed (them
) in the Hua-yen classification scheme. 
On the one hand, he regards the Western 
Paradise as the most expedient land in 
the immumerable Hua-yen pure lands.
On the other hand, he seems to have 
considered the Pure Land teaching as a 
special teaching that lies outside the 
usual scheme of classification."

Peak, and offering a bouquet of flowers

 ground and reverently asked the Buddha 
to preach the Dharma. The Buddha held 
out some flowers before the congregation
. No word, however, was uttered. No one 
could comprehend what he meant except 
Maha-kasyapa, who smiled. Then the 
Buddha exclaimed: 'I am the possessor of
 the eye of the True Dharma which is 
Nirvana. I now hand it over to Maha-
kasyapa.'" 
Maha-kasyapa thus became the first 
patriarch of the Ch'an / Zen school.

<xa>FOOD</xa>
<_-xa>Macrobiotic diet</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Vegetarianism</_-xa>; <_-xa>Killing</_-xa>;
 <_-xa>Herbs</_-xa>; <_-xa>Overeating</_-xa>

"The most important single rule with 
regard to food, in Buddhist tradition, 
is especially for the monk, that of 
restraint in eating, which covers also 
an obligation (for Theravada monks) not 
to eat after 12 noon (Fasting). Alcohol 
of any kind is forbidden 'as tending to 
cloud the mind' (Eightfold Path). The 
vow, incumbent on all Buddhists, 
monastic and lay, not to take life, 
causes them to be vegetarian, though 
with varying degrees of strictness." 
"The motivations for performing such 
acts (setting free captured fish, 
<pb n="746"/>
refusing to eat meat) are rooted not 
merely in ethical demands, but religious
 and psychological factors. When a 
person kills another sentient being, he 
breaks the hidden bonds among all forms 
of life. Violence alienates the violator
 not only from a sense of cosmic harmony
 but also, ultimately, from himself. For
 although the act of killing is extreme 
assertion of the self, the self which is
 so isolated and delimited, ironically 
ceases to have any real life or to have 
any real meaning. Buddhist vegetarianism
 is significant when viewed in this 
context. For even though one does not 
kill the animal himself, every time one 
eats meat, one denies the existence of 
any meaningful relationship between 
oneself and other beings. By 
objectifying an animal as 'food,' one 
can become insensitive to its suffering 
and regard it as a mere thing. On the 
other hand, each time he releases a 
creature from impending death, each time
 he returns it to freedom, a person 
reaffirms the original bond among all 
sentient beings. The act of releasing is
 a celebration of reunion, during which 
the selfish human is momentarily 
obliterated. The person who releases 
<pb n="747"/>
life in fact releases himself from human
 selfishness." 
NOTE:
"If you eat less, will you live longer? 
It is tempting to quip that life would 
at least seem longer. But the question 
is serious and has intrigued scientists 
since the 1930's, when it was discovered
 that a very low-calorie diet would 
lengthen rats' maximum life spans from 
three years to four, an increase of 33 
percent. 
Over the years, the finding has been 
confirmed many times in mice and other 
small animals, and has proved the only 
reliable means of extending a mammal's 
life span... 
People are already practicing caloric 
restriction. Many base their diets on 
books by Dr. Roy Walford, a researcher 
at the University of California at Los 
Angeles who recommends cutting back 
calories and body weight by about 20 
percent. In eight people he has studied 
on such a plan, Dr. Walford has found 
beneficial changes in blood pressure, 
blood sugar and cholesterol. A person 
who begins 20 percent calorie 
restriction at age 18 might live to be 
140 years old, Dr. Walford has estimated
<pb n="748"/>
. At 73, he himself eats only 1,800 
calories a day, as opposed to the 2,000 
to 2,800 normally recommended for a man 
his age." NY Times, Oct 7/97.

But it is not our intention, there are 
no personal villains; but all are

 chain is broken. Forgiveness is the 
weapon that permits us to open our eyes 
and see through our veil of protective 
lies. Your sins are forgotten... Take up

"Elder Pure Land Master Chu Hung had the
 utmost disdain for some Taoist beliefs 
which he :- regarded as especially ;: 
superstitious. One was the practice of 
communicating with spirits by the use of
<pb n="750"/>
 a planchette. He gave the following 
advice to one of his lay disciples, 
warning him of its bad effects: 'Spirits
 called forth by divination are seldom 
real. They pretend to be such-and-such a
 spirit, but in truth they are not. If 
one engages in this practice, one's 
spirit (shen) and vital breath (ch'i) 
will be harmed. In the Triple World, 
only the Buddha is the great teacher. 
Recite the Buddha's name with one mind, 
and then all demons will cease of their 
own accord."' 
"In Shanghai recently there were many 
gatherings where revelations and 
prophecies were proclaimed. Their 
messages about abandoning evil ways and 
practicing wholesome deeds, as well as 
their pronouncements on Birth and Death,
 Cause and Effect, while superficial and
 limited, are very useful for everyday 
morality and the minds of ordinary 
persons. However the points they made 
concerning the future and the Buddha 
Dharma were somewhat vague and not free 
of error. As disciples of the Buddhas, 
we should not oppose or reject those 
pronouncements, because doing so may 
hinder the good actions of others. At 
the same time, however, we should not 
<pb n="751"/>
repeat or extol them, lest we be guilty 
of chimerical statements and conjectures
 that bring harm and disorder to the 
Dharma and engender doubts among the 
people."

means of deliverance therefrom. This was

the Buddha after his enlightenment. The 
truths are that (1) all existence

 desire and illusion; (3) there is an 
end to suffering, and this state of no

practice of the eightfold Noble Path." 
"The first (Truth) is that the universal
 human experience of suffering, mental

the effect of past karma. The second is 
the perception that the cause of such 
suffering is craving or grasping for the
 wrong things, or for the right things 
in the wrong way.

See the following partial translation of

Yung Ming, the best known proponent of 
the harmonization of Zen and Pure Land:
"With both dhyana (Zen) and the Pure 
Land/ One is like a tiger with horns;/ 
In the present age a teacher of man,/ In
 the future a Buddhist Patriarch./ With 
dhyana but without the Pure Land/ Nine 
out of ten will take the wrong road;/ 
Without dhyana and with only the Pure 
Land,/ If ten thousand practice, ten 
thousand will go the right way." (Hsuan 
Hua, Pure Land ＆ Ch'an Dharma Talks, p. 
23-24). 
Master Yung-ming said: "Those who devote
 themselves to Ch'an and neglect Pure 
Land will fail, nine out of ten, to 
attain Enlightenment; but those who 
devote themselves to the practice of 
Pure Land will, without exception, have 
their awakening. Those who practice Ch'

<xa>FOUR</xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Four Alternatives</_-xa>

They are: a) existence; b) non-existence
; c) both existence and non-existence; d

from these propositions. 
"The 'Four Propositions' are ... said to
 underlie all human conceptions and to 
have fallacies which make it impossible 
for any one of them to be unequivocally 
true. On the other hand, defining 
existence as relative existence or 
conditioned existence, and non-existence
 as emptiness of absolute existence, 
Buddhist logic shows how all of them can
 be both true and untrue, summing up the
 foundations of philosophy therein."
Zen School
"The most important dialectical formula 
in the House of Lin-chi, 'the Four 
Alternatives' (Four Propositions) (Chin.
, ssu-liao-chien), describes four 
positions regarding the subject-object 
relationship. Lin-chi is said to have 
presented the following at one of his 
evening conferences: 'Sometimes I take 
away man and do not take away the 
<pb n="767"/>
surroundings; sometimes I take away the 
surroundings and do not take away man; 
sometimes I take both man and the 
surroundings; sometimes I take away 
neither man nor the surroundings.' These
 four alternatives or positions 
regarding subject and object represent 
an ascending grasp of reality. The 
formula is based on the well-known four 
propositions of Buddhist logic: being, 
non-being, both being and non-being, 
neither being nor non-being. They 
correspond to the four levels of reality
 (Skt., Dharmadhatu) in the Avatamsaka 
school. In the first and second stages, 
illusion is overcome first by the 
subject and then by the object. That is 
to say, all clinging to subjective 
intellectual perception and to the 
objective world is repudiated. The third
 stage negates both subject and object, 
but differentiation still remains. This 
posture of negation corresponds to the 
state of consciousness achieved in 
extreme concentration. Only in the 
fourth stage, which affirms the 
transcendence of the opposition between 
subject and object, does all 
confrontation between subject and object
 cease. Reality is comprehended in its 
<pb n="768"/>
ultimate oneness. In this formula the 
philosophy of the Middle Way Madhyamika 
and the metaphysics of the Avatamsaka 
school flow together."

Sukhavati淨土</_-xa>

In the T'ien-t'ai and Pure Land world 
views, the Pure of Amitabha Buddha (
Sukhavati) is composed of four realms. 
They are: i) The Land of Common 
Residence of Beings and Saints (Land 
Where Saints and Ordinary Beings Dwell 
Together), where all beings, from the 
six lower worlds (hells, hungry ghosts .
..) to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, 
live together. This Land of Common 
Residence is further divided into two, 
the Common Residence Pure Land and the 
Common Residence Impure Land; ii) The 
Land of Expediency (Land of Expedient 
Liberation), inhabited by Arhats and 
lesser Bodhisattvas; iii) The Land of 
Real Reward, inhabited by the highest 
Bodhisattvas; iv) the Land of Eternally 
Quiescent Light, in which the Buddhas 
<pb n="769"/>
dwell. These distinctions are at the 
phenomenal level. At the noumenon level,
 there is, of course, no difference 
among them. 
"Four types of land or realm 
corresponding to the three bodies of 
Buddha and four levels of spiritual 
development ... Of the three bodies of 
the Buddha, the Body of Enjoyment or 
Recompense (pao-shen) and Dharma-body (
fa-shen) correspond respectively to the 
third and fourth of these lands, while 
the two Bodies of Manifestation or 
Response (ying-chen)--one superior, the 
other inferior--are distinguished in 
accordance with the first and second of 
the Four Lands (See Muranaka, p. 350)."

"'Les Amis du Bouddhisme' was a Buddhist

Constant Lounsbery. The Society was 
established under the inspiration of the
 late Master Tai Hsu (q.v.) of China, 
while the latter was on a visit to 
Europe... Famous Bigandet, Poussin, 
Sylvain Levi, Grousset, David-Neel, 
Demieville, Guenon, Benoit...
"Les Arnis du Bouddhisme declined and 
ceased to function effectively by the 
end of the 1960's in spite of the 
efforts of Nelly Kauffman and Paul Adam.
<pb n="774"/>
 Incidentally, Adam is, to the best of 
available information, the first French 
national to be ordained a Theravada 
Bhikkhu. He entered the Sangha in India 
in 1953 with the name Aryadeva, in 
association with the Theosophical 
Society of France, brought Hindu, 
Mahayana and Vajrayana tendencies into 
its successor organization which is now 
called La Societe des Amis du Bouddhisme
. The tradition of Lounsbery was 
maintained by her student Teisen Perusat
 Stork, who embraced Buddhism in 1941 
and took an active part in the 
propagation of Theravada through study 
groups, classes and publications. In 
1908, she was ordained in Soto Zen 
tradition and since 1972 has been 
associated with the work of the World 
Federation of Buddhists through the 
Centre Francais de L'Association 
Mondiale des Bouddhiques ... Stork 
established Cannes in 1968. Like Teisen 
Perusat Stork, several French Buddhists 
have moved from one Buddhist tradition 
to another. In the process it was 
usually Theravada which first attracted 
them to Buddhism through its 
intellectual appeal. But progressively 
Zen and Vajrayana, with their emphasis 
<pb n="775"/>
on meditation and, to some extent, 
symbolic ritual, are found to be more 
satisfying. Besides, Zen and Vajrayana 
traditions have been propagated in 
France by intensely dedicated and 
capable Masters whose example and living
 testimony have proved to be most 
inspiring. 

Asian Buddhist Masters in France: Zen 
and Vajaryana 
1. One such Master was Taisen Deshimaru 
of Japan who settled in France in 1967. 
A prolific writer, he has several 
important publications to his credit ...
 He founded in 1970, L'Association Zen d
'Europe, which since 1982, is known as L
'Association Zen Internationale. It has 
established Zen centres in many parts of
 Europe and its Temple Zen de la 
Gendronniere accommodates up to 350 
participants in retreats of long 
duration. As could be centres among 
which some rivalry and dissension cannot
 be entirely ruled out. But the service 
they render in the promotion of Buddhism
 in France is indeed substantial. The 
most significant characteristic is that 
Zen organisations are headed, staffed 
and patronized mainly by French 
<pb n="776"/>
nationals, unlike other Buddhist ' 
traditions which continue to involve and
 even depend on immigrants from Buddhist
 Asia. 
2. The introduction of Tibetan Buddhism 
to France was a major contribution of 
Paul Arnold, who ... established the 
first Tibetan Gelugpa meditation centre 
in France at Forts-les-Bancs in Ain in 
1974.
With the increasing arrival of learned 
and experienced Tibetan Lamas as exiles,
 Vajrayana centres increased steadily 
and attracted substantial numbers of 
French enthusiasts ... In two decades, 
the numbers both of the monasteries and 
meditation centres and of the adherents 
and practitioners of the different 
traditions of Tibetan Buddhism have 
increased in France to the extent that 
practically every region has a minimum 
of one or two very active centres with 
significant congregations, and major 
centres are being planned and 
established on the most ambitious scale.
 
Like Zen, Vajrayana, too, has a large 
following of French nationals and most 
of them are professionals and 
intellectuals.
<pb n="777"/>

Influx from Buddhist countries of South 
and South-East Asia. 
The escalation of the political upheaval
 in Indo-China and the eventual rise of 
Communist regimes after the Vietnam war 
had a significant impact on Buddhism in 
France -- the third phase of the 
Buddhist Diaspora which began with the 
dispersal of Chinese Buddhists in 1949 
and Tibetan Buddhists in 1959. The mid-
1970's saw an unprecedented influx of 
refugees from Asia and the majority were
 Buddhists. Those from Cambodia and Laos
 professed Theravada while the 
Vietnamese Buddhists were for the most 
part adherents of the Mahayana tradition
. Modest temples and monasteries were 
established in large numbers not only in
 and around Paris but in most of the 
major cities of France ... 
It is the Vietnamese Buddhist community 
which has attained a unique level of 
visibility and influence ... Three 
organisations which came into existence 
around the same time in mid-1970 were 
Niem-Phat-Duong Khanh-Anh founded by 
Thich Minh-Tam; L'Association Culturelle
 Bouddhique Linh-Son, founded and 
directed by Thich Huyen-Vi and L'
<pb n="778"/>
Association Bouddhique Franco-
Vietnamienne. Many more have since 
arisen. The most impressive is the 
record of Thich Huyen-Vi, whose movement
 is world-wide and basic concentration 
is on higher learning, research and 
training in the Ch'an and Pure Land 
traditions. Himself a scholar, he 
supports several important international

"The evil deeds done by living beings 
bear corresponding results, yet even if 
one ought to fall into the Evil Paths, 
his offenses may be eradicated if his 
survivors cultivate holy causes for him.
 During a period of forty-nine days 
after the death, they should do many 
good deeds that can cause the dead one 
to leave the Evil Paths. (Sutra of the 
Past vows of Earth Store Bodhisattva (
Ksitigharba Sutra), Master Hsuan Hua
"Funeral arrangements should be kept 
simple, not accompanied by superfluous 
ceremonies occasioning unnecessary 
expenses. Another caveat: only 
vegetarian food should be served. No non
-vegetarian food should be provided as 
offerings or to entertain guests -- for 
to take life is to sadden the departed 
with more karmic obstructions and 'heavy
 baggage,' making his liberation that 
much more difficult. Even if he has 
already been reborn in the Pure Land, 
his grade of rebirth may be lowered as a
 result." 
NOTE:
To be truly effective in dedicating 
<pb n="781"/>
merit to others, the practitioner must 
be utterly sincere and singleminded in 
his recitation. Even if he is, the 
Ksitigarbha Sutra teaches that the 
deceased can only receive a small part 
of this merit. Furthermore, since the 
crucial conditions of sincerity and 
single-mindedness are seldom achieved in
 full, most intercessions are, at best, 
partially effective and can seldom erase
 a lifetime of bad karma. Thus, it is 
imperative for the practitioner himself 
to cultivate during his lifetime and not
 rely on family members, monks or nuns 
at the time of death.

<_-xa>Death and Burial</_-xa>; <_-xa>Death</_-xa>; <_-xa>Stupa</_-xa>

"The methods of disposing of the dead 
practised by Buddhists were inherited 
from Indian culture. The Buddha was 
cremated with honours customarily given 
to a great king, according to the 
MahaParinibbana Sutta (sutra). The 
cremation was carried out by the Malla 
tribes-people of Kusinagar, where he 
<pb n="782"/>
died. After 7 days of ceremonial homage,
 the body was wrapped in 500 layers of 
new cloth, placed in an iron sarcophagus
 filled with oil, and placed on a 
funeral pyre, made of many kinds of 
fragrant wood. They were unable to 
ignite the pyre, however, until 500 
Buddhist monks led by Maha-Kasyapa 
arrived and reverenced the Buddha's body
. After that, the pyre is said to have 
burst into flames spontaneously. When 
the fire had died down, only the bones 
were left: 'the body of the Blessed One 
burned itself away. . . neither soot nor
 ash was seen.' For 7 days the closely 
guarded bones were honoured' with dance 
and song and music, and with garlands 
and perfumes.' King Ajatasattu, hearing 
of Buddha's death and cremation, 
proposed to build a stupa over the 
remains.
The Licchavis, the Sakiyas, the Bulis, 
the Koliyas, and the Mallas and a 
brahman of Vethadipa also claimed a 
right to build a stupa. The remains were
, therefore, divided into 8 parts, and 8
 stupas were built, by the various 
claimants in their respective 
territories. That the Buddha was 
cremated indicates not that this was 
<pb n="783"/>
universal practice among Buddhists, but 
rather his status as a great man. "

also circulates as a separate sutra; 
consists of the entire chapter 39, the

its style of sculpture, which was a 
blend of ancient Indian modified by 
Graeco-Roman styles of Asia Minor. Its 
<pb n="784"/>
period was A.D. 100-300. Ancient Indian 
Buddhist art did not depict the figure 
of the Buddha but symbolized his 
presence. Gandhara art depicts the 
Buddha's figure, the whole life history 
of the Buddha being given. Under Kusana 
kings (Kaniska) i.e., during 
approximately the first 3 centuries A.D.
, this area was one of a flourishing and
 vigorous Buddhist culture with many 
monastic centres of learning. During the
 2nd century A.D. and after, Gandhara, 
was an area which nourished Buddhist 
missionary expansion northwards and 
eastwards into China. The multi-storied 
pagoda which Emperor Kaniska built at 
Peshawar (Pakistan), was regarded as one
 of the wonders of the world at the time

 is sometimes referred to as the 'Yellow
 Hat School' because they rejected the 
traditional red hat of the prior 
Buddhist schools in favor of the yellow 
hat now traditional in their group. They
 became the most influential of the 
Tibetan Buddhist Schools, and once the 
line of the Dalai Lamas was established 
within this school, the Gelugpa school 
was afforded political leadership as

 of the Yokawa Eshin-in on Mount Hiei. 
Genshin's name is intimately associated 
with the development of raigo imagery:

paintings of the Descent (Raigo / q.v.),
 and although these attributions are 
open to doubt, the fact that they have 
been made with such insistence over the 
centuries indicates how important 
Genshin was for the tradition. The monk'

his monumental essay, the Essentials of 
Rebirth (Ojo Yoshu), whose passages 
inspired numerous artistic works." 
"Genshin (942-1017), a Tendai monk,

<xa>GERMANY</xa>
<_-xa>Europe (Buddhism in)</_-xa>

"Germany is and has always been the only
 (western) rival to England in its 
interest in Buddhism. Apart from its own
 pioneer Buddhist scholars, such as 
Neumann and Oldenberg, German scholars 
have become famous in other lands, as 
Nyanatiloka and Govinda. In 1903 a 
Buddhist Mission Society was founded at 
Leipzig, and held a Buddhist Congress in
 1906. As early as 1888 the Bhikshu 
Subhadra (Zimmermann) published his 
Buddhist Catechism, while Buddhist 
Essays by Dr Paul Dahlke appeared in 
1908. George Grimm's Old Buddhist 
Community was founded at Utting in 
Bavaria in 1921; the Gemeinde um Buddha 
worked in Berlin from 1928-33, and by 
the Second World War there were active 
centres also in Hamburg, Stuttgart, 
<pb n="791"/>
Munich, Dusseldorf and Cologne, some 
publishing their own journals. After the
 war, Guido Auster founded a Buddhist 
Secretariat in Berlin to reorganize the 
suppressed Buddhist activities, and in 
1955 a pan-German society was founded as
 the Deutsche Buddhistische Union, with 
headquarters in Munich (subsequently 
moved to Hamburg)." 
"Most Buddhists in Germany adhere to the
 Theravada but there are also followers 
of the Mahayana, e.g. the active "Arya 
Maitreya Mandala" of the Vajrayana 
school (Berlin and other cities 1952) 
and the "Buddhistische Gemeinschaft Jodo
 Shinshu" (Berlin 1956). Since about 
1964, also Zen Buddhism has been 
favoured by quite a number of Germans...
Today meditation, both Satipatthana and 
Zazen, is being practiced under the 
guidance of resident or visiting 
meditation masters from Sri Lanka, 
Thailand, and Japan, mostly in Berlin 
and Hamburg (Roseburg)."

NOTE:
"The Dhamma came first to Germany 
through books, therefore a word should 
be added on the Buddhist literature now 
available in the German language. It is 
<pb n="792"/>
immense in quantity and excellent in 
quality. Of the original scriptures 
practically the whole Suttapitaka has 
been translated from the Pali into 
German, and the Suttas have held to this
 day the main interest of German 
Buddhists. Foremost among the 
translators were Karl Eugen Neumann (
1865-1915) Nyanatiloka Mahathera (
18781957), Karl Seidenstucker, Paul 
Dahlke (1865-1928), Wilhelm Geiger, and 
Julius Dutoit. Max Walleser should be 
mentioned as a translator and 
interpreter of Mahayana scriptures. 
Buddhological studies have been 
conducted at most of Germany's 
universities in the field of Indology 
and Comparative Religion. A special 
chair for Buddhological studies has been
 created at the University of Hamburg."

and many people were dying of starvation
. The king then gathered all the grain 
to be found in the country and 
distributed it equally among the people.
 At that time a Pratyeka Buddha who had 
dedicated himself to Buddhist practice 
for forty kalpas appeared and begged for
 food. The king gave him his last bit of
 food as an offering. This good deed 
caused various grains to fall from the 
skies like rain for seven days. 
Thereafter, seven kinds of treasures as 
well as clothes, food and other 
necessities rained down every seventh 
day, putting an end to the people's 
poverty."

attainment of Buddhahood. They include 
acts of self-restraint, mental 
cultivation, worship, and generous 
giving, but also faith and benevolent 
feelings. They are like roots because, 
once performed, they remain as the basis
 for future virtue, and, if properly 
cultivated, grow, mature, and bear fruit
." 



<xa>GOOD</xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Kalyanamitra</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Teacher</_-xa>
<_-xa>Guru</_-xa>; <_-xa>Unsolicited Friend
</_-xa>; <_-xa>Lama</_-xa>

Kalyanamitras, Gurus, virtuous friends, 
wise persons, Bodhisattvas, Buddhas -- 
anyone (even an evil being!) who can 
help the practitioner progress along the
 path to enlightenment. This 
<pb n="798"/>
notwithstanding, wisdom should be the 
primary factor in the selection of such 
an advisor -- the advisor must have 
wisdom, and both advisor and 
practitioner must exercise wisdom in 
selecting one another.

Each spiritual advisor in the Avatamsaka
 Sutra takes a different form, but they 
all flow from Bodhisattva Manjusri, the 
personification of wisdom. Thus, . 
wisdom is of paramount importance in 
choosing a spiritual advisor.

"In certain other spirituals, traditions
, as you know, the guru virtually rules 
his students' lives, even to the extent 
of telling them whether to marry and 
have children. His word is law. If his 
spirituality is deep, there is little 
danger. If it is not, God help the 
student! Shun any teacher who says, 'I 
am enlightened.' Beware of any guru who 
claims to be an avatar, an incarnation 
of a god or Buddha. Above all, avoid the
 'master' who allows his followers to 
shout his praises with arms upraised at 
mass rallies, and to laud him as the 
holiest of holies. He is the greatest 
menace." 
<pb n="799"/>
"During the period I was living in 
ashrams and meditation centers in 
Southeast Asia I heard it said that no 
matter what superior qualities a guru 
may possess, if he is obviously seeking 
name and fame, is after money, or is 
carrying on with his female students, 
these impurities will corrupt his 
teaching; a prospective student would 
therefore do well to avoid him." 
"When a monk lives in the age of the 
True Law, he should never make 
discriminations in regard to people. But
 when a monk lives in this age of the 
Degenerate Law, he should fear nothing 
more than failing to make 
discriminations in regard to people. The
 reason is that in this last age of the 
Law, good and bad elements mingle 
together. If one does not make a right 
judgement but chooses the wrong person, 
if one regards him who is heterodox as 
orthodox, if one becomes friendly with 
him whom he ought to avoid and avoids 
him whom ha ought to be friendly with, 
one will surely become the same as one's
 teacher. Furthermore, in future lives 
he will always be a companion to Mara (q
.v.). Is it then not apparent that one 
has to be watchful in seeking out a 
<pb n="800"/>
teacher?" (Elder Master Chu Hung) 
"According to the Brahma Net and 
Avatamsaka Sutras, we should ignore 
appearances and external forms when 
seeking a good spiritual advisor. For 
example, we should disregard such traits
 as youth, poverty, low status or lack 
of education, unattractive appearance or
 incomplete features, but should simply 
seek someone conversant with the Dharma,
 who can be of benefit to us. Nor should
 we find fault with good spiritual 
advisors for acting in certain ways, as 
it may be due to a number of reasons, 
such as pursuing a hidden cultivation 
practice or following an expedient 
teaching. Or else, they may act the way 
they do because while their achievements
 may be high, their residual bad habits 
have not been extinguished. If we grasp 
at forms and look for faults, we will 
forfeit benefits on the path of 
cultivation. Thus, when Buddha Sakyamuni
 was still alive, the Bhikshu Kalodayin 
was in the habit of moving his jaws like
 a buffalo; a certain Bhikshuni used to 
look at herself in the mirror and adorn 
herself; another Bhikshu liked to climb 
trees and jump from one branch to 
another; still another always addressed 
<pb n="801"/>
others in a loud voice, with 
condescending terms and appellations. In
 truth, however, all four had reached 
the stage of Arhatship. It is just that 
one of them was a buffalo in a previous 
life, another was a courtesan, another 
was a monkey, and still another belonged
 to the Brahman class. They were 
accustomed to these circumstances 
throughout many lifetimes, so that even 
when they had attained the fruits of 
Arhatship, their residual habits still 
lingered. We also have the example of 
the Sixth Patriarch of Zen. Realizing 
that the cultivators of his day were 
attached to a literal reading of the 
sutras and did not immediately recognize
 their Buddha Nature, he took the form 
of an ignorant and illiterate person 
selling wood in the marketplace. Or else
, take the case of a famous Zen Master 
who, wishing to avoid external 
conditions and concentrate on his 
cultivation, took the expedient 
appearance of a ragged lunatic, raving 
and ranting. As a result, both 
distinguished Masters were criticized 
during their lifetimes. The Sixth 
Patriarch was faulted for ignorance, 
while the Zen monk was called insane and
<pb n="802"/>
 berserk. Therefore, finding a good 
spiritual advisor is a difficult task 
indeed! Students of the Dharma should 
realize this, to decrease the habits of 
attachment and grasping -- thus avoiding
 the mistake of maligning monks and nuns
.

<xa>GREAT</xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Dharani of the Most 
Compassionate One</_-xa>
<_-xa>Avalokitesvara</_-xa>

The Great Compassion Mantra is very 
popular among Mahayana Buddhists, both 
clergy and laymen. It is associated with
 the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara. The 
mantra is part of the daily liturgy 
recited by most Mahayana Buddhists in 
Asia. According to Buddhist teachings, 
anyone reciting this mantra will have 
his wholesome wishes fulfilled. 
"Why is it called the 'Great Compassion 
Mantra?' Because its compassion can 
relieve living beings of all their 
suffering and difficulty. Because it 
relieves suffering and bestows happiness
, it's called the Great Compassion 
Mantra."

In the Sutra of the Great Compassion 
Heart Dharani, the Bodhisattva 
Avalokitesvara (Kuan Yin) said to the 
Buddha: "Great Honored Teacher! If any 
sentient being should assiduously recite
 the Great Compassion Mantra and still 
descend upon the Three Evil Paths, I vow
<pb n="804"/>
 not to attain Buddhahood. If any 
practitioner should assiduously recite 
the Great Compassion Mantra and fail to 
be reborn in the lands of the Buddhas, I
 vow not to attain Buddhahood. If any 
practitioner should assiduously recite 
the Great Compassion Mantra and not 
achieve innumerable samadhis and great 
eloquence, I vow not to attain 
Buddhahood. If anyone should recite the 
Great Compassion Mantra and not have all
 the wishes and hopes of his present 
life fulfilled, this dharani cannot be 
called the Great Compassion Dharani! The
 only exceptions are wishes which are 
unwholesome and those made when the Mind
 is not utterly sincere.

Illustrative story: 
"There was once a man who recited the 
great Compassion Dharani for about 
twelve years ... every day at least 108 
times, and sometimes many more times ...
 Once, while travelling, he stopped for 
the night at an inn. The innkeeper was a
 thief (who) just sat in his inn and 
waited for rich guests to come by. He 
would give them a fine room, a strong 
dose of drugged wine, and then, in the 
middle of the night ... he would sneak 
<pb n="805"/>
into their rooms to rob them and 
sometimes even murder them. The man who 
recited the great Compassion Dharani 
believed in the Buddha, however, and so 
he didn't drink the wine ... At about 
one o'clock in the morning, he heard 
someone slowly open the door and sneak 
into his room. Opening his eyes just a 
crack, he saw the glint of a butcher's 
shiny blade flash in the moonlight. '
Someone means to kill me,' he thought, 
paralyzed with fear. At that very moment
, there was a knock on the door. The 
would-be murderer quickly put the blade 
behind his back and went to the door. '
Who is it?' he whispered. 'My name is 
Dou Shu Peng', came the reply. Peeking 
through the keyhole, the innkeeper saw a
 large man dressed in a policeman's 
uniform. 'What do you want?' he asked 
nervously. 'I have come to visit my 
friend who is staying in this room. Won'
t you please tell him to stop by my 
house tomorrow morning for breakfast?' '
Yes, I'll do that,' said the innkeeper 
and the policeman left ... The innkeeper
 decided he had best do no murdering 
that night. The next morning the 
innkeeper told the guest, 'A friend of 
yours named Dou Shu Peng was by last 
<pb n="806"/>
night. He came to invite you to his 
house for breakfast.' 'Dou Shu Peng? ...
' said the guest, and then he remembered
 that in the Great Compassion Dharani, 
there is a line 'Dou Shu Peng'. 'Yes!' 
he exclaimed, 'I do have such a friend. 
I was just on my way to meet him.'"

Syn: <_-xa>Craving</_-xa>
<_-xa>Three Poisons</_-xa>

"Also 'desire', one of the major 
afflictions. The basic worldly instinct 
of grasping, especially manifested in 
lust, avarice, and craving." 
"The five desires in their gross forms 
are easy to detect. The practitioner 
should, additionally, pay attention to 
the deep-seated, subtle manifestations 
of greed. For example, a hundred 
thousand dollars might not necessarily 
excite a person's greed, but an amount 
in the millions could move his mind; 
ordinary beauty can easily be resisted 
but heavenly charm has the power to lure
 people down the path of transgression. 
Even monks and nuns can be infatuated 
with exquisitely carved rosaries, 
beautiful statues or auspicious, 
peaceful realms; these too are in the 
category of defiled greed. We shouldsee 
them as expedients, illusory causes and 
<pb n="808"/>
conditions, and not develop defiled 
greed. To shed light on this state of 
mind, I shall cite a story as example. 
Once upon a time there was an official 
who was well-known for his honesty. He 
would sternly reprimand those who 
attempted to bribe him with money and 
gold. One day, however, a rich and 
powerful person, seeking the resolution 
of a private matter, offered him the 
equivalent of a hundred thousand dollars
. The official immediately accepted the 
bribe. Later on, when a friend asked him
 why, he replied, 'A hundred thousand in
 cash can sway the gods.' Thus, this 
official could only be honest with small
 bribes, but could not resist huge ones.
 This is a case of deep-seated greed. 
Another story dates from the Ming 
dynasty. One day, an Elder Master was 
conversing with a visiting monk. The 
guest lamented, 'The majority of today's
 monks and nuns are defiled by the 
desire for fame and profit.' The Master 
replied, 'I notice that you are pure and
 clean, because you have always rejected
 fame and profit.' When the visiting 
monk heard this, his face brightened for
 a fleeting moment. This monk, while 
disliking ordinary fame, was attached to
<pb n="809"/>
 a lofty reputation. This is a case of 
profound subtle greed. There is another 
story (which forms the basis of a well-
known koan). Once there was a devoted 
old woman who built a place of retreat 
for a monk, arranging that he would not 
lack for anything, so that he could 
concentrate upon his meditation and 
practice. One day, after twenty years, 
she instructed her daughter: 'Today, 
after serving the Master his meal, take 
advantage of the situation to embrace 
him tightly, asking him at the same time
, "how does it feel to be hugged these 
days?" Come back and let me know his 
answer as faithfully as you can.' The 
daughter dutifully did as she was told, 
putting her arms around the Master and 
asking the question. The Master replied,
 'I am not moved in the very least by 
sexual desire, no different from a dried
 up tree leaning against a cold mass of 
rocks in the middle of winter, when not 
even a drop of warmth can be found.' The
 young girl repeated the answer to her 
mother, who said unhappily, 'I have 
really wasted my time and effort during 
the last twenty years. Little did I know
 that I was only supporting a common 
mortal!' Having said this, she went out,
<pb n="810"/>
 evicted the monk, lit a fire and burned
 the meditation hut to the ground. In 
truth, it is rare enough these days for 
anyone to cultivate to the level of that
 monk. As far as the old woman is 
concerned, she is said to have been a 
Bodhisattva in disguise. Her action of 
burning down the hut was to 'enlighten' 
the Master. Why is this so? It is 
because, while not moved by sexual 
desire, he still saw himself as pure and
 was still attached to the empty and 
still aspects of samadhi. Thus, he had 
not attained true and complete Awakening
. Although this Master had reached a 
fairly high level of attainment, he was 
still attached to the mark of purity. 
This is another instance of subtle greed
, which the practitioner should sever. 
The same is true for the Pure Land 
practitioner. He should know that all 
forms and marks are illusory. Even 
though he may have reached the level of 
one-pointedness of mind and seen 
precious lotus blossoms, other 
auspicious marks, or transformation 
bodies of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, he 
should realize that these are merely 
instances of good causes leading to 
auspicious results. He should be calm 
<pb n="811"/>
and still and not greedy for them -- nor
 should he deny their occurrence. Only 
then will he understand and be awakened 
to the principle of Truth-like No-Void 
of the Mind-ground." 



<xa>GUEST-DUST</xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Foreign Dust Afflictions</_-xa>
<_-xa>Mind</_-xa>

"Guest-defilement, so called because, 
according to Buddhism, the mind is 
inherently pure, but is covered by 
foreign (guest) defilements. Once these 
are removed, its pure nature will shine 
forth." 
"Afflictions are called 'guest dusts.' 
They are 'guests' because they come and 
go, unlike our empty and still True 
Nature. They are 'dusts' because they 
stick to and defile the True Mind, just 
like the dust which covers a bright 
mirror and prevents it from reflecting 
the objects before it." 



<xa>GURU，上師</xa>
<pb n="812"/>
Syn: <_-xa>Teacher</_-xa>
<_-xa>Good Spiritual Advisor</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Lama</_-xa>; <_-xa>Unsolicited friend</_-xa>

"Sanskrit term most often rendered as '
teacher.' In some Buddhist traditions, 
the guru represents the spiritual 
teacher who guides the adept on the 
Buddhist path. Precisely because of the 
significance of the role of the guru in 
helping the student make spiritual 
progress, the student must place 
complete confidence in the guru's 
knowledge, and thus obediently follow 
the guru's instructions, however unusual
 or eccentric they may appear. 
The trust required in the guru's 
guidance has raised curious questions, 
especially in modern Buddhism, about the
 authenticity of some rather 'colorful' 
and unorthodox teachers who have 
appeared on the Buddhist landscape." 
"Whether a teacher is female or male, it
 is very risky to begin teaching, much 
more adapting techniques, before we have
 fully mastered fundamental Buddhist 
teachings and learned to put them into 
practice. Without sufficient preparation
, there are dangers of misinterpreting 
the Dharma and of misguiding others in 
<pb n="813"/>
their spiritual development. These 
dangers are magnified in the case of 
transmitting Dharma in new lands and to 
fresh minds where there is little 
background against which to weigh and 
measure what is being presented. In such
 a climate, students need to exercise 
maximum discretion in choosing a teacher
. These days there are many concepts, 
practices, and styles of behavior being 
marketed under the label 'Dharma' that 
have little or nothing whatsoever to do 
with Dharma. Even allowing for human 
error, there is a code of ethics 
involved in giving teachings. Likewise, 
there is a degree of individual 
responsibility incumbent upon those 
receiving teachings. Thoughtful people 
would do well to consider these matters 
and to be clear about what is involved 
in their choice of teachers, for their 
own psychological well-being as well as 
for positive development of Buddhism in 
the West. There are times when it is 
wise and virtuous to suspend judgment 
and other times when it can be 
disastrous. It is therefore essential to
 allow ample opportunity for assessing a
 path and a teacher. Well-reasoned 
adaptation of the Buddhist teachings and
<pb n="814"/>
 traditions to Western situations will 
be of great benefit to Western people, 
but slipshod importation, gullible 
acceptance, baseless fabrication, and 
shoddy conduct can lead to an altogether
 mistaken amalgam which may do more harm
 than good ... We should be ever so much
 more discerning when choosing a 
spiritual teacher, not judging by 
superficial matters such as attractive 
appearance, charisma, eloquence, or 
language proficiency. Particularly in 
America these days, anybody can set up 
shop and teach practically anything. 
There is no way to certify the person's 
character, however, and no assurance of 
where the path may lead. Experimentation
 may prove harmless, but in the case of 
spiritual development, dabblers run the 
risk of creating much inner confusion. 
At this critical juncture, it is 
advisable to see beyond nationality and 
other external criteria, and to rely 
upon a qualified teacher with a 
traceable lineage that has been known to
 produce enlightened beings in the past.
 Confidence in the path and the guide 
are as important as confidence in 
oneself, and confidence should be based 
on sound judgment, remembering the 
<pb n="815"/>
fallibility of even that. Until full 
enlightenment is reached, we are liable 
to err in our perceptions of both self 
and others. In all Buddhist traditions, 
perfect morality is the most fundamental
 of all qualifications for a teacher. It
 is the basis of all other 
accomplishments. For example, there are 
eight specific qualities required for 
Vinaya instructors, ten qualities 
enumerated for a Mahayana guru, and ten 
further qualities for a guru expounding 
tantra, pure morality being prerequisite
 in all cases. To refrain from harming, 
misappropriation, sexual misconduct, 
untruthfulness, and intoxication are the
 precepts for ordinary lay Buddhists and
 are fairly elemental behavioral 
guidelines for all decent human beings. 
It goes without saying that those who 
claim to be spiritual teachers should be
 above such misbehavior. Since abuses of
 authority are unfortunately rampant 
these days, it behoves spiritual seekers
 to be judicious in their choice of 
guidance. In the case of the Tantric 
school, the matter is far more serious, 
since one is bound by certain 
commitments once the master/disciple 
link is formed. Even the receiving of a 
<pb n="816"/>
simple initiation puts one under these 
commitments, so great care must be taken
 to assess the qualities of a teacher 
before attending such ceremonies. One is
 allowed up to twelve years to observe 
the conduct and examine the qualities of
 a potential teacher before establishing
 a master/disciple relationship." (Karma

Buddha/ proceedings of the first 
International Conference on Buddhist 
Nuns: 1987 -- H.H. Dalai Lama: Keynote 
speaker) 
NOTE:
"The Indian spiritual teacher is often 
seen as the embodiment of the holy, the 
presence of the divine in human form. 
Contrary to the assumption of several 
generations of Western scholars, in the 
Indian view of a human religious teacher
, if he is in the ranks of spiritual 
masters, he may have many superhuman 
traits and faculties (such as wonder-
working powers, omniscience, mind 
reading). Moreover, his disciples may 
believe in the presence of such traits 
even during the master's lifetime."

Biography of Dharma Master Shaokang.
"The dharma master was from the Zhou 
clan of Jinyun. His mother was of the 
Luo clan. Once she dreamed that she 
journeyed to Dinghu Peak, where a jade 
maiden gave her a blue lotus blossom ...
 Even at seven years old, Kang did not 
speak. Prognosticators thought it very 
strange. Once his mother took him to 
Lingshan Monastery. Directing him to the
 Buddha hall, she said, 'When you 
reverence the Buddha, don't be hasty.' 
To which he replied, 'Who wouldn't be 
reverent towards our Lord Buddha 
Sakyamuni?' (After this episode,) his 
mother and father looked upon him with 
even greater respect and awe. Ultimately
, they allowed him to leave home as a 
novice monk. By age fifteen he had 
perfectly memorized five scriptures, 
including the Lotus and Surangama Sutras
. Later he set off for Jiaxiang 
Monastery in Kuaiji to study the Vinaya 
codes. After that he went to Shangyuan 
where he attended lectures on the 
Avatamsaka Sutra and various treatises 
<pb n="818"/>
such as the Yogacarabhumi. At the 
beginning of the Zhenyuan reign of the 
Tang dynasty (785-805 A.D.) he was 
residing at White Horse Monastery in 
Luoyang. There he once saw light 
radiating from a text stored in the hall
. He picked it up and found it to be the
 venerable Shan-Tao's Treatise on 
Converting to the Way of the Western 
Pure Land. Master Shaokang thereupon 
proclaimed, 'If I have a karmic 
connection with the Pure Land, may this 
text again put out radiance.' No sooner 
did he speak these words than the text 
again blazed with light. Shaokang said, 
'Though stones may grind me for an eon, 
I will not deviate from my vow.' 
Subsequently he proceeded to Shan-Tao's 
mortuary hall at Radiant Light Monastery
 in Changan. There he set out a great 
array of offerings. All of a sudden he 
saw Shan-Tao's commemorative image rise 
up into the air and address him, saying,
 'By relying on my teaching you will 
widely convert sentient beings. On a 
select day in the future your 
meritorious efforts will bear success 
and you will assuredly be born in the 
Land of Ease and Succor.' Thereupon 
Master Shaokang set off southward for 
<pb n="819"/>
Jiangling. On the road he met a monk who
 told him, 'If you wish to convert 
people you should go to Yanzhou.' As 
soon as he finished speaking these words
, he disappeared. When the master 
entered Xinding commandery, no one there
 knew him. ... After a little more than 
a month, he had gathered a considerable 
crowd of children who would come to 
recite the Buddha's name. The master 
thereupon said to them, 'To anyone who 
can do ten recitations of the Buddha's 
name without interruption I will give 
one coin.' He continued this for a full 
year, after which ... the sound of 
reciting the Buddha's name (nianfo) 
filled the streets. In the tenth year of
 Zhenyuan's reign, Shaokang built a Pure
 Land chapel on Mount Wulong. He 
constructed an altar of three levels, 
where he gathered his followers to 
perform ritual services and 
circumambulation. Whenever the master 
ascended the high seat and chanted the 
Buddha's name out loud, the congregation
 would see a single buddha issue from 
his mouth. When he recited ten such 
recitations, they would see ten buddhas.
 The master said, 'Those of you who see 
these buddhas are certain to achieve 
<pb n="820"/>
rebirth in the Pure Land.' At that time 
the group numbered several thousand. 
Those among them who failed to see the 
buddhas wailed and reprimanded 
themselves, resolving to persevere even 
more zealously in their practice. On the
 third day during the tenth month of the
 twenty-first year (of the Zhenyuan 
reign), the master called together his 
lay and monastic followers and charged 
them saying: 'You should engender a 
heart that delights in the Pure Land and
 despises this deluded world of 
Jambudvipa. If on this occasion you can 
see my radiant light then you are truly 
my disciple.' Thereupon, the master put 
forth various unusual beams of light and
 passed away (from Comprehensive Record 
of the Buddhas and Patriarchs).

<xa>HAN</xa>
"(206 BCE-220 CE). Chinese dynasty that 
saw the introduction of Buddhism into 
China." 
"Period in Chinese history (206 B.C.-220
 C.E.) during which Buddhism entered 
China. In the first century A.D. the Han
 Dynasty began to extend its sphere of 
influence into Central Asia, an area 
that was rife with Buddhist groups from 
a variety of traditions. Thanks to the 
Silk Route, merchants moved freely back 
and forth between areas and cultures, 
creating an atmosphere in which Buddhism
 was able to make its first inroads into
 China. Although there are a variety of 
accounts of Buddhism's first entry to 
China in the Han Dynasty, it met with a 
Chinese environment dominated by 
Confucian and Taoist culture. Buddhism 
made gains in Lo-yang where a 
translation center was organized by 
foreign monks. The first Chinese 
<pb n="822"/>
converts joined the Buddhist community, 
and Buddhist ideas were being circulated
 by the time of the downfall of the Han 
Dynasty in 220." 



<xa>HAN-SHAN</xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Han-Shan Te-Ch'ing</_-xa>
<_-xa>Yung-Ming</_-xa>; <_-xa>Chu-Hung</_-xa>; <_-xa>Yin-Kuang</_-xa>
憨山，德清
"An illustrious Chinese monk during the 
Chinese Ming Dynasty. After joining the 
Buddhist order at the age of eleven, he 
studied the Hua-yen-ching (Avatamsaka 
Sutra) under Wu-chi. He travelled and 
visited many teachers in order to 
acquire knowledge. Then he settled down 
at Pei-Yai (the Northern Peak i.e. Han-
shan of the Wu-Yai-shan) and there 
practiced Ch'an (Zen). Hence his name 
Han-shan." 
"Elder Zen Master Han-Shan TeCh'ing (
1546-1623) was one of the three 'dragon-
elephants,' or most illustrious monks, 
during the final years of the Ming 
dynasty -- 'an age of corruption, 
internal oppression and external 
weakness."' 
Originally trained in the Sutra Studies 
<pb n="823"/>
and Zen schools, he came to excel in 
other traditions as well, achieving 
great renown as a teacher and exponent 
of the Avatamsaka Sutra. He is 
particularly credited with reviving the 
Zen school in China. Born to a humble 
family, he came to mingle with the 
greatest political figures of China 
through his acquaintance with the 
Empress Dowager. This master/disciple 
relationship aroused the jealousy of the
 emperor and led to his imprisonment, 
banishment and forced return to lay life
. Only toward the end of his life was he
 rehabilitated. 
"Han-shan Te-ch'ing composed an 
autobiography which is a unique document
. The autobiography contains interesting
 details about his spiritual development
 from childhood, his various activities 
during each year of his life, and his 
tragic involvement in the political 
power struggles that took place in the 
Imperial court. In reading Han-shan's 
autobiography, one can easily imagine 
how a Buddhist monk lived in China at 
that time. The state of Ming Buddhism 
was clearly reflected in the personal 
life of Han-shan Te-ch'ing. ... Te-ch'
ing's thought may be called the 
<pb n="824"/>
philosophy of Mind. The Mind stands for 
the ultimate reality, even though there 
are philosophical problems concerning 
its metaphysical status. In any case, he
 used the concept 'Mind' to integrate 
all the aspects of his thought and to 
explain all questions about reality and 
salvation. An outstanding feature of Te-
ch'ing's philosophy of Mind is 
universalism. This philosophy affirms 
the ultimate unity and identity of all 
beings and of all doctrines. Reflecting 
the fact that he was living in China, he
 argued that Taoism, Confucianism, and 
Buddhism taught about the same ultimate 
truth of Mind and that they differed 
only in degree of penetration." 
NOTE:
"Han-shan did not write any commentary 
on the (two Amitabha Sutras), and it is 
not clear how he placed (them) in the 
Hua-yen classification scheme. On the 
one hand, he regards the Western 
Paradise as the most expedient land in 
the immumerable Hua-yen pure lands. On 
the other hand, he seems to have 
considered the Pure Land teaching as a 
special teaching that lies outside the 
usual scheme of classification."

is essentially a one page condensation 
of Mahayana philosophy, especially 
emphasizing the doctrine of emptiness." 
"Shortest of the forty sutras that 
constitute the Prajnaparamita group of 
sutras. One of the most important sutras
 of Mahayana Buddhism, particularly in 
East Asia, it is recited by monks and 
nuns of all schools. The sutra is 
especially emphasized in Zen, since it 
formulates in a particularly clear and 
concise way the teaching of shunyata (
emptiness), the immediate experience of 
which is sought by Zen practitioners. 
The pith sentence of the Heart Sutra is,
<pb n="826"/>
 'Form is no other than emptiness; 
emptiness is no other than form,' an 
affirmation that is frequently referred 
to in Zen." 
NOTE: 
In the Mahayana tradition, the Heart 
Sutra is recited at the end of each 
service. There have been in total eight 
translations of the sutra into Chinese; 
the one in use today was translated by 
Patriarch Hsuan-tsang.



<xa>HEAVEN</xa>
<_-xa>Dhyana Heavens</_-xa>; <_-xa>Hell</_-xa>; <_-xa>Death</_-xa>

"The Buddhist concept of heaven and hell
 is entirely different from that of 
other religions. Buddhists do not accept
 that these places are eternal. It is 
unreasonable to condemn a man to eternal
 hell for his weakness but quite 
reasonable to give him every chance to 
develop himself. From the Buddhist point
 of view, those who go to hell can work 
themselves upwards by making use of the 
merit they had acquired previously. 
There are no locks on the gates of hell.
 Hell is a temporary place and there is 
<pb n="827"/>
no reason for those beings to suffer 
there forever. The Buddha's teachings 
show us that there are heavens and hells
 not only beyond this world, but in this
 very world itself... The fire of hell 
in this world is hotter than that of the
 hells in the world-beyond. There is no 
fire equal to anger, lust, greed or 
ignorance. According to the Buddha, we 
are burning from eleven kinds of 
physical pain and mental agony: lust, 
hatred, illusion, sickness, decay, death
, worry, lamentation, pain (physical and
 mental), melancholy and grief. People 
can burn the entire world with some of 
these fires of mental discord. From a 
Buddhist point of view, the easiest way 
to define hell and heaven is that 
wherever there is more suffering, either
 in this world or any other plane, that 
place is hell to those who suffer. And 
where there is more pleasure or 
happiness, either in this world or any 
other plane of existence, that place is 
heaven to those who enjoy their worldly 
life in that particular place. However, 
as the human realm is a mixture of both 
pain and happiness, human beings 
experience both pain and happiness and 
will be able to realise the real nature 
<pb n="828"/>
of life. But on many other planes of 
existence, inhabitants have less chance 
for this realisation. In certain places 
there is more suffering than pleasure, 
while in some other places there is more
 pleasure than suffering. Buddhists 
believe that after death, rebirth can 
take place in a number of possible 
existences. This future existence is 
conditioned to a great extent by the 
last thought-moment a person experiences
 at the point of death. This last 
thought which determines the next 
existence results from the past actions 
of a man either in this life or before. 
If the predominant thought reflects 
meritorious action, he will find his 
future existence in a happy state. But 
that state is temporary and when it is 
exhausted a new life must begin all over
 again, determined by another dominating
 'karmic' energy.
This repetitious process goes on 
endlessly unless one (escapes from the 
cycle of Birth and Death through 
cultivation). Heaven is a temporary 
place where those who have done good 
deeds experience more sensual pleasures 
for a longer period. Hell is another 
temporary place where evil-doers 
<pb n="829"/>
experience physical and mental suffering
. It is not justifiable to believe that 
such places are permanent ... Each and 
every person experiences according to 
his good and bad karma." 
"There is no hell in the sense of a 
state of endless torture known to 
Buddhism. The various hells are 
purgatorial states called apayas. Avichi
 is the lowest and most severe of the 
apaya states."

<xa>HERESY，異教</xa>
<_-xa>Excommunication</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Heretical views</_-xa>

"Heresy is primarily a Western religious
 concept; there is no exact Buddhist 
equivalent. The nearest approximation is
 drsti (Sanskrit), literally a view, 
usually a 'wrong' view, that is due not 
to reason but to craving or desire. The 
<pb n="834"/>
most serious form of 'heresy' according 
to Buddhist tradition is to assert the 
reality and permanence of the individual
 human ego, i.e., the assertion of atta 
or atman. Since the Western concept of 
heresy implies an orthodoxy capable of 
denouncing heresy and willing to do so, 
the approximation of Buddhist drsti to 
Western heresy here comes to an end, 
Buddhism having no authoritative 
hierarchy, and no sacramental sanctions.
 On the whole, the attitude of Buddhist 
schools seems to have been that more 
prolonged meditation will eventually 
cause 'heretics' to see the error 
involved in their view, and its 
abandonment."

"The general name given to the social-
cultural-religious system of the Indo-
Aryans (who migrated into India just 
before the dawn of history). In its 
essence, Brahmanism advocates: 1. 
Maintenance of the four castes (which 
assures the supremacy of the priestly 
cast, the brahmana). 2. Appeasement of 
the gods by means of rituals derived 
from the sacred Vedas (which have to be 
performed by brahmana ...) 3. Fidelity 
to the theory of karma and reincarnation
 (almost universal in India), with 
rebirth in heaven seen as the final goal
 of earthly life. From Brahmanism also 
emerged various popular sects, which 
worship anthropomorphized gods, such as 
Brahma, Visnu, and Siva." 
 



<xa>HINDUISM</xa>
<_-xa>Ambedkar</_-xa>; <_-xa>Hinduism</_-xa>
; <_-xa>India (Buddhism in--)</_-xa>

"Buddhism was initially established as a
 reform movement opposed to vedic 
<pb n="837"/>
authority, brahmanic ritualism and the 
caste system of Hinduism. However in the
 ninth century Hinduism launched a 
counter-attack. Buddhist ideas were 
deliberately incorporated into Hinduism 
and the historical Buddha declared an 
incarnation of the god Visnu. What once 
had been attractive in Buddhism could 
now be found (theoretically) in Hinduism
 as well." 
"In Hindu tradition, the main duties 
assigned to women were childbearing and 
housework. Consequently, a single life 
was seen as a wasted life and unmarried 
women were subject to scoffs. On the 
contrary, in Buddhism, married life was 
viewed as a hindrance to spiritual 
pursuits. Wherever the Buddhist point of
 view prevailed, a woman was no longer 
compelled to marry to achieve self-
respect and approval from her family. 
Once the order of nuns was established, 
it provided an even better option for 
women who were spiritually and 
religiously inclined." 
Despite the ascetic nature of Hinduism 
at its higher level, the religion 
contains a strong element of fertility 
rites and beliefs. The widespread 
worship of the lingam and yoni (male and
<pb n="838"/>
 female sex organs) is a typical example
. This is in contrast to Buddhism, where
 chastity and self-restraint in all 
matters are considered the most 
effective way to end the cycle of Birth 
and Death (by eliminating desire, the 
root cause of suffering).

Syn: <_-xa>Genku</_-xa>
<_-xa>Jodo school</_-xa>; <_-xa>Pure Land 
School</_-xa>; <_-xa>Pure Land Buddhism (
summary)</_-xa>

"Honen Shonin (1133-1212), also called 
Genku established in 1175 the Jodo or '
Pure Land' school in Japan. He was born 
in Mimasaka Province and at the age of 
nine became a disciple of Kankaku at 
Zendai-ji temple. At fifteen, he entered
 Mt. Hiei and studied the teachings of 
the Tendai school. At the age of 
eighteen, he moved to Kurodani on Mt. 
Hiei where he studied Pure Land 
<pb n="840"/>
teachings. He left Kurodani on one 
occasion to study the doctrines of the 
other schools, and on his return he read
 through the Tripitaka. He is said to 
have reached an awakening in 1175 on 
reading Shan-tao's Meditation Sutra, and
 thereafter dedicated himself solely to 
the chanting of Amida Buddha's name. The
 founding of the Jodo school is dated 
from this event."

"At age forty-three he became concerned 
that practitioners were not able to 
achieve enlightenment through the Tendai
 path, and turned to the Pure Land 
teachings of Shan-tao and Genshin, 
convinced that reliance on Amitabha 
Buddha was the certain path to salvation
. Honen's writings on the Pure Land were
 seized and burned, but he continued to 
preach his Pure Land message of the 
repetition of Amida's name in the 
formula of the Nembutsu to all listeners
. In 1206 Honen was exiled by his rivals
, returning to Kyoto in 1211, only a 
year prior to his death." 
"His fundamental tenet was belief in the
 power and grace of Amitabha, lord of 
Sukhavati (the Western paradise). He 
advocated repeated invocation of 
<pb n="841"/>
Amitabha's name, by which anyone, 
ignorant or wise, high or low, could be 
saved. His teachings were based on that 
of master Hui Yuan, the Chinese founder 
of the Pure Land school." 
(I) Honen's Death
See the following passage on the last 
moments of Honen:
"At the hour of the serpent (10 a.m.), 
on the day of his death, his disciples 
brought him an image of Amida, three 
feet high, and as they put it on the 
right side of his bed, asked him if he 
could see it. With his finger pointing 
to the sky he said, "There is another 
Buddha here besides this one. Do you not
 see him?" Then he went on to say, "As a
 result of the merit of repeating the 
sacred name, I have, for over ten years 
past, continually been gazing on the 
glory of the Pure Land, and the very 
forms of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, 
but I have kept it secret and said 
nothing about it. Now, however, as I 
draw near the end, I disclose it to you.
" The disciples then took a piece of 
cord made of five-colored strands, 
fastened it to the hand of the Buddha's 
image, and asked Honen to take hold of 
it." (Rev. Harper Havelock Coates and 
<pb n="842"/>
Rev. Ryugaku Ishizuka, tr., Honen, the 
Buddhist Saint: His Life and Teaching, p
.636.)
(II) Honen's Thoughts
"A. Question 1. Is it possible for a man
 to enter the Pure Land simply by 
concentration of mind and the repetition
 of the nembutsu, and doing nothing else
, even though his heart undergoes no 
change? 
Answer:--It is the rule with common men 
for their hearts to be in a state of 
confusion and it cannot be helped. The 
only thing is that if men do concentrate
 their minds upon Amida, and call upon 
his name, their sin will be destroyed, 
and they will attain rebirth in the Pure
 Land. Even sins more grievous than that
 of mental confusion disappear, if men 
practice the nembutsu. 
B. Question 2. Even if we do not fix the
 number of times for repeating the 
nembutsu as our daily task, is it not 
all right to do it as often as one can? 
Answer:-It is better to fix the number, 
lest you yield to laziness 
C. Question 3. Ought we to practice the 
nembutsu after eating leeks, onions or 
meat, while the scent of them still 
remains in the mouth? 
<pb n="843"/>
Answer:--There is nothing whatever in 
the world that should interfere with the
 practice of the nembutsu. (For need to 
avoid leeks and onions as much as 
possible, however, see Herbs (pungent).)
 
D. Question 4. How many repetitions of 
the sacred name should one regard as a 
day's work? 
Answer:--Well, the number of nembutsu 
repetitions may begin with ten thousand,
 and then go on to twenty, thirty, fifty
, sixty or even a hundred thousand. 
Everyone should in his own heart and 
according to his own will, determine the
 number within these limits. 
E. Question 5. Even if one does not see 
a Buddha, or fasten a cord from one's 
hand to the Buddha's, or even call upon 
the sacred name oneself, is it possible 
to be born into the Pure Land at death 
merely by listening to others repeating 
the nembutsu? 
Answer:--It is not always necessary to 
fasten the cord to one's hands, nor to 
meet the Buddha face to face, but by 
means of the nembutsu alone, one can 
attain rebirth in the Pure Land. And so 
long as one has a very utterly deep 
faith, it is enough to listen to other 
<pb n="844"/>
men's repetitions of the nembutsu. 
F. Question 6. Though one may wish to be
 eternally free from the experience of 
birth and death, and never to be born 
again into this Three-Fold World, is it 
true as some say, that, even after one 
has been reborn in the Land of Perfect 
Bliss, the karma which has brought one 
there (ultimately) loses its efficacy, 
so that one may be reborn again here 
into the Three-Fold World? Now I have no
 wish to be so reborn, even though I 
might be born a king, or born into the 
so-called heavenly world above. My one 
wish is to get entirely free from this 
world, and never return here, and so to 
this end what should I do?
Answer:--Such ideas are entirely wrong. 
If one is once born into the Land of 
Bliss, one will never return to this 
world, but every such one will attain 
Buddhahood. Only in case one wishes to 
come back to save others, he may indeed 
do so, but by so doing, he (is not in 
fact within the cycle) of birth and 
death. There is nothing better than the 
practice of the nembutsu to get safely 
out of this ThreeFold World and be born 
into the Land of Perfect Bliss. So you 
ought to practice it most diligently. 
<pb n="845"/>
G. Question 7. When one is about to die,
 is it enough, in order to attain 
rebirth in the Pure Land, to repeat the 
nembutsu as one ordinarily does, without
 calling a religious adviser? 
Answer:--Even though no religious 
adviser comes in, and one is not able to
 die as painlessly as he desires, he 
will attain rebirth in the Pure Land if 
only he repeats the nembutsu (with One-
Pointedness of Mind). 
H. Question 8. When evil thoughts will 
keep arising within the mind, what ought
 one do? 
Answer:--The only thing to do is to 
repeat the nembutsu.
I. Question 9. Is it all right to make 
up on one day for religious duties that 
were neglected on another day? And may 
one store up merit now, so as to be 
forehanded for the future? 
Answer:--It is all right to make up for 
past losses. But to be laying up for the
 future (forgetting the present) would 
tend to laziness."

"Horizontal" and "vertical" are figures 
of speech, which can readily be 
understood through the following example
. Suppose we have a worm, born inside a 
<pb n="847"/>
stalk of a bamboo. To escape, it can 
take the hard way and crawl "vertically"
 all the way to the top of the stalk. 
Alternatively, it can poke a hole near 
its current location and escape "
horizontally" into the big, wide world. 
The horizontal escape, for sentient 
beings, is to seek rebirth in the Pure 
Land of Amitabha Buddha. 
"These days many people like to talk 
about studying enlightenment and finally
 transcend birth and death. They do not 
realize that in this world complete 
enlightenment is extremely difficult. 
They think of it as direct, sudden, '
vertical' transcendence of the Triple 
World of Desire, Form, and Formless 
states. But even someone who has 
overcome desire and reached the stage of
 a 'once-returner' still has to go to 
his death and come back once more 
through rebirth: how much the more so, 
for an ordinary person! Most of the 
sentient beings in this world will have 
to be reborn in the Pure Land first 
before they can be completely 
enlightened. The Pure Land gate to the

慧遠
(Also Lu-Shan Hui-Yuan; Vn/Hue-Vien.) "
Founder of the Pure Land school in China
 in the Chin Dynasty (4th-5th c.) 
Student of Tao-an (312-385), inspiration
 of the White Lotus Society. A native of
 Lou-fan, in Yen-men, Shansi. His early 
years were spent in the study of 
Confucianism and Taoism. In his 2lst 
year, he was converted to Buddhism and 
became the most brilliant disciple of 
Tao An (312-385). His fame as a Buddhist
 master and expositor of Buddhist 
teachings spread far and wide. He 
founded the Tung-lin monastery on Lu 
Shan in Central China, to which he 
retired, and this became the most famous
 centre of Buddhism in South China. He 
drew his inspiration largely from the 
Longer and Shorter Sukhavati-Vyuha 
Sutras (the two Amitabha Sutras), with 
their vivid descriptions of the 'Pure 
Land' and the infinite compassion of 
Amitabha Buddha. In 402 he founded the 
White Lotus Society (Pai-Lien Chiao), 
when he assembled the monks and laymen 
of his community before an image of 
Amitabha, stressing the importance of 
worship, the use of icons in meditation 
and devotion to Amitabha. In later times
<pb n="856"/>
, this event was taken to mark the 
beginning of the Pure Land school, of 
which Hui Yuan is reckoned the founder."
 

"In 402, Hui-yuan and his group ... made
 a collective vow to be reborn together 
in Sukhavati. But because of individual 
differences in karmic maturity, they 
realized that some participants would 
gain rebirth before others. Thus, they 
vowed that the early arrivals in 
Sukhavati would exert themselves to 
share their salvation with those lagging
 behind. If they could adhere to this 
pact, they would in the end all be 
reborn and together 'miraculously behold
 the great appearance of Amitabha and 
open their hearts to his pure brightness
 ...'He fostered translation activities 
and also composed the influential 
treatise Sha-men pu-ching wangche lun (
Monks Do Not Pay Homage to the Ruler), 
which defended the autonomy of the 
Buddhist clergy. Moreover, his 
devotional groups exemplify his most 
enduring influence on Chinese Buddhism."

"The Tung-lin-ssu (Monastery of the 
Eastern Grove), finished in ca.386 and 
<pb n="857"/>
located at Kiangsi, China was to serve 
as Yuan's home for the rest of his life.
 The location was a perfect setting for 
a monastery, for the buildings were put 
up amidst caves, waterfalls, rock 
formations, mountain springs, and 
floating clouds. After his quarters were
 finished, it was said that Yuan did not
 leave the mountains for thirty years. 
His biography recorded that 'his shadow 
never left the mountain, his footprints 
never entered the secular world. When he
 bade farewell to his guests, he went 
only as far as the Tiger Creek.' His 
fame, however, was truly far-reaching, 
for monks, laymen, and famous literary 
figures converged on Lu-shan from all 
directions. When Huan Hsuan (the local 
ruler) wanted to purge the monastic 
community of undesirable elements, he 
specifically exempted Lu-shan from the 
scope of the purge saying that the 
community at Lu-shan was a model of 
religious discipline. It was also Yuan 
who was able to dissuade the ruler from 
requiring monks to render obeisance to 
him."

NOTE:
"In. Theravada Buddhist thought 
<pb n="858"/>
immortality or the deathless state is 
Nirvana (Nibbana). One of the adjectives
 applied to Nirvana from earliest days 
is amata, i.e. deathless (e.g. Sutta 
Nipata 960). The deathless realm is 
considered to be gained not at the end 
of one individual's span of existence, 
but as a result of spiritual refinement 
which may be continued throughout many 
generations; it is held to be the 
outcome of a process of moral and 
spiritual refinement initiated and 
pursued by free choice, once the 
possibility of such a goal has been 
heard of, through the Buddha-Dhamma.
A modification of this view occurs in 
the Pure Land Buddhism of East Asia, 
where an intermediate goal is introduced
, attainable without the long 
preparation through many existences 
necessary for Nirvana. This short-term 
religious goal is rebirth in the heaven 
of Amitabha Buddha, known as the Pure 
Land or Sukhavati. Such rebirth is made 
possible by the compassion and spiritual
 power of the Buddha, faith of the 
believer and Buddha Recitation. Strictly
, however, this is not immortality, in 
that even such blissful rebirth must be 
followed up by further cultivation 
<pb n="859"/>
before the ultimate goal, i.e., 
Buddhahood, is reached." 



<xa>HUMAN</xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Skin-bag</_-xa>; <_-xa>Body</_-xa>
<_-xa>Illness</_-xa>; <_-xa>Meditation on 
Death</_-xa>

Note the words of Bodhidharma, the first
 Zen Patriarch in China:
"To dwell in the Three Realms is to 
dwell in a burning house. To have a body
 is to suffer. Does anyone with a body 
know peace?" (Red Pine, tr., The Zen 
Teaching of Bodhidharma, p. 5.) 
"The human body is likened to a skin-bag
 full of excrements which obstructs our 
realization of the truth." 
"What the Buddha said is that the human 
body is just a skin-bag full of filth. 
What does it have inside? What else but 
excrement and urine? It's all stored in 
there. What could possibly be good about
 that? ... No matter how perfect a 
person may be on the surface, inside 
there are just masses of filth. Urine 
and excrement collect inside, and the 
Nine Orifices (q.v.) constantly Bow with
<pb n="860"/>
 impurities. Matter comes out from the 
eyes, wax from the ears, mucus from the 
nose, and saliva from the mouth. Then 
there is urination and defecation. Now, 
which of these is pure and clean?" 
"Therefore, Buddhist practitioners 
should constantly visualize this body as
 a mass of flesh and bones, blood and 
pus, a skinbag containing phlegm, pus, 
urine, feces and other foul-smelling 
substances. The Parinirvana Sutra states
: 'This fortress of a body -- only evil,
 deluded people could tolerate living in
 it. Who with any wisdom would ever 
cling to or delight in such a skin-bag!'
 Another scripture states: 'This body is
 the confluence of all kinds of 
suffering; it is a jail, a prison, a 
mass of ulcers; everything is impure. In
 truth, it is not worth clinging to -- 
even the celestial bodies of deities are
 no different.' Therefore, whether 
walking, standing, sitting or reclining,
 whether asleep or awake, cultivators 
should always visualize this body as 
nothing but a source of suffering, 
without any pleasure, and develop a deep
 sense of disgust ... (thus gradually 
becoming free from lustful thoughts). 
Moreover, the cultivator should also 
<pb n="861"/>
engage in the Seven Types of Meditation 
on Impurity (e.g., as a fetus, in the 
impure, dirty area of the womb, drinking
 the mother's blood, emerging from the 
womb with pus and blood gushing forth 
and foul odors in profusion ... after 
death, the body swelling up and rotting 
away, with flesh and bones in disarray..
.). Our own bodies being thus, the 
bodies of others are likewise. If we 
constantly meditate on these seven 
impurities, we will develop disgust 
toward those male and female forms which
 ordinary people judge handsome and 
beautiful. The flames of lust will thus 
gradually diminish. If, in addition, we 
can practice the meditations on the Nine
 Kinds of Foulness, (e.g., meditation on
 the fresh corpse, the bloated corpse, 
the bleeding and oozing corpse, the 
skeleton ... and other progressive 
stages of decay of the human body after 
death), so much the better."

NOTE:
It should be clear that although the 
Buddhas taught that the human body is a 
skin-bag filled with excrements, theirs 
is not a pessimistic view of life, but a
 realistic one. The Buddhas recognized 
<pb n="862"/>
the need to use the body as a means to 
Enlightenment. Thus, one important 
injunction to monks and laymen is never 
to entertain the thought of suicide.



<xa>HUMAN</xa>
<_-xa>Six Planes of Existence</_-xa>

To illustrate the extreme difficulty of 
rebirth in the human realm (as opposed 
to the lower realms of hell, hungry 
ghosts or animality), Sakyamuni Buddha 
compared it to the likelihood that a 
blind sea turtle, surfacing from the 
depths of the ocean only once every 
century, would encounter a tree trunk 
with a hole suitable for nesting.
Skeptics beware: millions of humans may 
be born each year in this world, but how
 many more million of viruses come into 
being each moment on a tiny mound of 
earth?
Samyutta Nikaya V. 455
"Sooner, do I declare, would a one-eyed 
turtle, if he were to pop up to the 
surface of the sea only once at the end 
of every hundred years, chance to push 
his neck through a yoke with one hole 
<pb n="863"/>
than would a fool, who has once gone to 
the Downfall, be reborn as a man."

NOTE:
"Of special importance is the teaching 
that the human state -once lost is hard 
to regain. Unless careful preparation 
for death has been made, the 
consciousness will be reincarnated in 
non-human forms many, many times -- 
perhaps for aeons -- before the dual 
endowment of birth as a human being in a
 land where the Dharma is preached is 
obtained once more."

gradually work themselves upwards to 
better forms of existence. 
Finally, however, everyone will obtain 
<pb n="864"/>
an embodiment of such great ethical 
possibilities that he can destroy 
craving and ignorance in himself and 
escape the compulsion for further 
rebirth. It is regarded as certain that 
all who strive for emancipation will 
gain it sometime or other."

 Xu-Yun 1988:191
"From the hundred-foot pole, as the 
Chinese say, at the top of which is the 
height of thought, we must take the 
existential leap to direct awareness, 
and this super-thinking is, in 
particular, the springboard of the 
Chinese 'Ch'an' which became in Japan '
Zen' Buddhism."

"A denizen of one of the miserable

have huge stomachs which always burn

which food cannot pass. One may be 
reborn in this state if he has extreme 
greed or avarice." 
"In Buddhism, unhappy spirits of the 
departed, who are unable to find rebirth
 in an embodied form, are referred to by
 the ancient Indian term 'preta' (hungry
 ghosts). Their wretched existence is 
regarded as enduring until their evil 
karma is exhausted, when they will 
achieve further, possibly more happy, 
rebirth. They inhabit the region 
immediately below the surface of the 
earth; sometimes they are found on the 
surface in a situation somewhat superior
 to that of inhabitants of the various 
hells in the bowels of the earth." 
"A condition in the cycle of rebirth 
reserved for those who perish in a state
 of deep dissatisfaction, usually as a 
consequence of their greed. Hungry 
ghosts wander in a limbo-like state in 
which they can find no satisfaction for 
their desires, especially, but not 
exclusively, their hunger and thirst."

"Jpn., lit. 'one moment of consciousness
 (nen), ten thousand years'; this 
expression of Mahayana Buddhism, in 
which the number ten thousand simply 
means a limitlessly large number, refers
 to the experience common to mystics and
 saints of all cultures that in the

<xa>ICONS，像</xa>
<_-xa>Buddha Images</_-xa>

"Before an icon can perform its role in 
Buddhist ceremonies, it must undergo 
certain preparations. For a consecration
 rite, it must be imbued with religious 
energy. The ways of achieving this 
differ according to the various schools 
of Buddhism... A quasi-magical ceremony 
designed to bring a sculptured icon 'to 
life' is the Eye-Opening Rite which can 
be traced back to practices in India. 
The act of dotting in the pupils with 
ink invested an image with religious 
power. An undated Edo-period manuscript 
with commentaries on the Hizoki, an 
early Shingon text often attributed to 
Kukai (774-835), gives a clear 
explanation of this ceremony's effect on
 an icon: 
'As long as the Eye-Opening Ceremony has
<pb n="870"/>
 not yet been performed on an icon 
carved of wood or stone, or in painted 
form, it should be regarded in the same 
way as inanimate plants or wooden 
substances. But after the main priest 
has consecrated the image by dotting in 
its eyes, and has bestowed upon it the 
force of grace by means of mudra, 
mantras, and meditative vision, the now 
dignified wooden substance or plain 
woven material (of the painting) has 
merged inseparably with the original 
substance of the depicted deity, 
although the priest has in no way 
effected a change in the basic material 
of the wood, clay, or stone. . . . After
 the Blessing of the Three Mysteries has
 been performed, the original substance 
of the deity and its shadow image have 
become unified into an inseparable whole
, and the characteristics of the shadow 
image will manifest themselves instantly
...' 
Another common method of investing an 
image with religious power was the 
insertion of sacred objects into its 
hollow interior. This custom can 
probably be traced back to the 
deposition of relics in pagodas. 
Sculptures became the repositories not 
<pb n="871"/>
only for actual relics (q.v.) of 
deceased holy persons, but also for 
objects such as mirrors, coins, 
woodblock prints, books with sutra texts
, and hand-written documents giving the 
reason for the dedication as well as 
names of the persons involved... Another
 possible method for bringing a 
sculpture 'to life' was the custom of 
providing real clothing for it, a 
practice which probably originated in 
India and which has been observed in 
China and Japan..." 



<xa>IGNORANCE，無知</xa>

<xa>ILLNESS，病</xa>
<_-xa>Practice</_-xa>; <_-xa>Human Body</_-xa>

"In Buddhist teachings ... a person who 
is not enlightened is -- by definition -
- 'ill'. The healing process is the 
conversion of suffering into the 
aspiration to attain enlightenment." (R.
 Birnbaum, The Healing Buddha.) 
<pb n="872"/>
"(In the Vimalakirti Sutra), the sage 
Vimalakirti discussed the experience of 
illness at great length .. With many 
visitors assembled to inquire after his 
health, the infirm sage took the 
opportunity to speak out against the 
human body and its limitations: 
'O, virtuous ones, the wise do not rely 
upon the body. It is like a mass of 
froth which cannot be grasped, like a 
bubble which bursts in an instant. The 
body is like a flame arising from the 
thirst of love ... like a shadow, 
appearing as a result of karma. It is 
like an echo, responding to causes and 
conditions ... The body does not act of 
itself; but it is spun around by the 
forces of the winds of passion.' 
His own face gaunt and creased by 
illness, vividly impressing upon 
visitors the transitory nature of 
earthly existence, Vimalakirti then 
urged them to seek the Buddha-body." (R.
 Birnbaum, The Healing Buddha) 
NOTE:
"Similar to Vimilakirti's concept and to
 Sakyamuni's fundamental teachings, an 
illness when properly dealt with can 
serve as a major event that propels one 
onwards towards higher spiritual 
<pb n="873"/>
attainment. In the case of healings by 
the Medicine Buddha (Bhaishajya-guru), 
the sincere act of faith by the ill 
person results in healings granted. 
During the healing process, insight 
arises that causes the person to reform 
the patterns of his deeds, words and 
thoughts, so that they accord with the 
quest for Enlightenment. (Raoul Birnbaum
, The Healing Buddha, p. 69.)" 



<xa>ILLUSION，幻</xa>
<_-xa>Emptiness</_-xa>

"One of the key concepts in Buddhism. 
Things in the phenomenal world are not 
real or substantial, as ordinary people 
regard them to be. They are transient, 
momentary, indefinite, insubstantial, 
and subject to constant alteration. In 
reality they are like phantoms or 
hallucinations." 
"Phenomenal 'existence,' as commonly 
perceived by the senses, is illusory; it
 is not real inasmuch as, though it 
exists, its existence is not permanent 
or absolute. Nothing belonging to it has
 an enduring entity or 'nature' of its 
<pb n="874"/>
own; everything is dependent upon a 
combination of fluctuating conditions 
and factors for its seeming 'existence' 
at any given moment.' Thus we have the 
expression, 'illusory but not non-
existent.'"

<xa>IMMOLATION</xa>
<_-xa>Vietnam (Buddhism in);</_-xa>

"Fire was often the theme of the Buddha'
s sermons. In one sermon, he spoke of 
the world aflame, of all men on fire 
with passion, hatred, infatuation, birth
, old age, sorrow, grief and despair. He
 explained that all are blinded by these
 flames and that when men understand the
 holy way the fire will be extinguished 
within them; that they will no longer be
 blinded by the attractions of the flame
 and will be free of the fires of 
passion and desire. In a parable the 
Buddha told a story of the affection 
<pb n="875"/>
between an old man and a hare. When the 
old man was starving, the hare threw 
himself into the flames that his body 
might supply food for his friend. 
Transformed, he became a vision of the 
Buddha; the old man then realized that 
within the small body of the hare lived 
the unselfish spirit of the Buddha." 
"Bodhisattvas who gave their life 
altruistically for other beings were 
regarded as noble and blameless; one 
such was the Bodhisattva Vessantara, who
 sacrified himself for a hungry tigress 
and her newborn cubs. This is recorded 
in the Vessantara Jataka. There is 
another form of religious suicide, known
 as self-immolation. The burning of 
their own bodies by Buddhist monks in 
Vietnam as a protest against the regime 
arguably falls into this category. The 
important point in these events is, of 
course, not the act itself, but the 
question of its motive or intention, and
 the state of mind in which it was 
carried out." 
"The practice of self-immolation is 
explicitly countenanced in the Lotus 
Sutra: The story is related of a 
Bodhisattva who bathed himself in 
perfumed oil and set fire to himself in 
<pb n="876"/>
an act of self-offering to the Buddha. 
Although the sutra goes on to say that 
realisation of the truth of the Dharma 
is more meritorious than such acts, 
nevertheless the practice of self-
immolation seems to have developed among
 Chinese Mahayana Buddhists among whom 
this sutra (translated into Chinese in 
early 3rd century AD) was very popular."
 



<xa>IMMORTALITY,長生</xa>
<_-xa>Amitabha Buddha</_-xa>; <_-xa>Pure</_-xa>
Land Buddhism (Summary)

"In Theravada Buddhist thought 
immortality or the deathless state is 
Nirvana (Nibbana). One of the adjectives
 applied to Nirvana from earliest days 
is amata, i.e. deathless (e.g. Sutta 
Nipata 960). The deathless realm is 
considered to be gained not at the end 
of one individual's span of existence, 
but as a result of spiritual refinement 
which may be continued throughout many 
generations; it is held to be the 
outcome of a process of moral and 
spiritual refinement initiated and 
<pb n="877"/>
pursued by free choice, once the 
possibility of such a goal has been 
heard of, through the Buddha-Dhamma. 
A modification of this view occurs in 
the Pure Land Buddhism of East Asia, 
where an intermediate goal is introduced
, attainable without the long 
preparation through many existences 
necessary for Nirvana. This short-term 
religious goal is rebirth in the heaven 
of Amitabha Buddha, known as the Pure 
Land or Sukhavati. Such rebirth is made 
possible by the compassion and spiritual
 power of the Buddha, faith of the 
believer and Buddha Recitation. Strictly
, however, this is not immortality, in 
that even such blissful rebirth must be 
followed up by further cultivation 
before the ultimate goal, i.e., 
Buddhahood, is reached."

One of the most basic truths taught by 
the Buddha. "Everything in the world 
arises, changes and perishes; nothing 
<pb n="878"/>
remains constant for even a single 
moment."

When the practitioner sees the signs of 
impermanence (e.g., parched skin, grey 
hair) he should redouble his efforts at 
cultivation, so as to escape Birth and 
Death. This is, of course, the opposite 
of common, everyday behavior, which 
consists in hiding the truth -- coloring
 one's hair, for example.

Quotes / Unquotes
"Students in this age of the decay of 
the Dharma are superficial in their 
learning. They do not understand the 
real truth. Thus, in their study of 
Buddhist scriptures, they cling to 
famous sayings and fail to comprehend 
the ultimate truth. They increase their 
(relative) knowledge and become boastful
 of their achievements. They produce 
increased karmas leading to a 
continuation of the cycle of life and 
death precisely by means of the Buddhist
 teachings. This is because they did not
 start with the question of life and 
death when they began to search for the 
Mind. .. The first principle of Ch'an (
Zen) practice is to empty one's mind. 
<pb n="879"/>
One must first paste the two words "life
-death" on the forehead, and regard them
 as seriously as if one owed a debt of a
 million taels." (Zen Master Han-Shan Te
- Ch'ing, in Sung-peng Hsu, A Buddhist 
Leader in Ming China.) 
"Dear friends, the murderous demon of 
impermanence is constantly looking for 
our lives and will never agree to 
conclude peace with us! Let us hastily 
develop a long enduring mind to get out 
of birth and death.' Master Yuan Miao of
 Kao Feng said: 'If one sets a time 
limit for success in the Ch'an (Zen) 
training, one should act like a man who 
has fallen to the bottom of a pit one 
thousand chang (about two miles) deep.
His thousand and ten-thousand thoughts 
are reduced to a single idea on how to 
escape from the pit. He keeps it up from
 morning to evening and from evening to 
the following morning, and has no other 
thought. If he trains in this way and 
does not realize the truth in three, 
five or seven days, I shall be guilty of
 a verbal sin for which I shall fall 
into the hell where tongues are pulled 
out.'" (The Ch'an Training by Master Hsu
 Yun, p. 42.) 
A Life Story
<pb n="880"/>
"You have breast cancer," the surgeon 
said, a serious look on his face. I just
 laughed and said, "No, I don't. The 
lump is nothing. You said so yourself." 
"You have breast cancer," he repeated. 
All I could do was look into his eyes 
and say, "It has to be a joke. I'm only 
twenty-seven..." I had thought that 
breast cancer was a disease of my mother
's generation or of women who have a 
family history of the disease. But on 
February 24, six weeks after my twenty-
seventh birthday, I started a war with 
my body. My doctor was ashen when he 
broke the news to me. I stared for what 
seemed like hours at the picture of his 
daughter, who
looked like me -- young, black hair, 
brown eyes. A lawyer, I was told. It 
could have been her; she could have been
 me. But it wasn't her. I had the 
disease for which there is no cure -- 
just treatments that might or might not 
work. No promises, no guarantees. At 
twenty-seven, I had thought I had a 
lifetime in front of me. The day before 
my biopsy, I wanted a family, kids, a 
house, a car. Now, three hours after the
 biopsy, I wanted someone to tell me how
 I was going to tell my friends that I 
<pb n="881"/>
might not live out the year. 
I had recently attended my fifth reunion
, where I caught up on what people were 
doing with their careers and lives. For 
many of us at the reunion, the fifth 
year after graduation, seemed to mark a 
transition time. We were making choices 
about the direction of our lives -- 
starting, finishing, or otherwise 
thinking about going to graduate school,
 getting married, moving... I never 
expected that less than a year later, I 
would be making decisions about how I 
was simply going to survive."  
NOTE: As a practical application, if 
family members constantly "dangle the 
word Death before their eyes," realizing
 that it can strike at any time, there 
will be less friction, less anger, more 
tolerance of others' shortcomings -- 
more compassion.

"The immediate context of the emergence 
of Buddhism in India in the fifth 
century B.C. is the sramana movement, in
 which independent ascetics freed 
themselves from Vedic authority, 
brahmanic ritualism, and conservative 
<pb n="884"/>
social tradition and established 
communities for the purpose of exploring
 new paths to spiritual liberation. The 
fatalist Ajivakas, the naturalist 
Lokayatas, the Agnostic school, the 
Jains, and the Buddhists were the 
foremost of these groups. The teaching (
Dharma) of the Buddhist group is closely
 associated with the life of its founder
 Sakyamuni, acclaimed as Buddha, or 
awakened one." 

"With the passing of Candrakirti, the 
Madhyamika master, and Silabhadra, the 
Yogacara master, both of whom lived 
during the seventh century, Buddhism in 
India was slowly beginning to be 
engulfed by the relentless tide of 
Hinduism. As a matter of fact, this 
process of the absorption of Buddhism 
into Hinduism had already started before
 the seventh century. During the Gupta 
period (fourth to sixth centuries), 
Mahayana Buddhism began to incorporate 
many of the Hindu deities into its 
pantheon ... This process of Hinduizing 
Buddhism meant the slow, inexorable 
death of Buddhism in India during the 
eighth and ninth centuries. By that time
 the line of demarcation between 
<pb n="885"/>
Buddhism and Hinduism was practically 
obliterated. The final blow was 
administered by the Moslem invasion. The
 initial invasion overran northwest 
India in 1001, with the Moslems carrying
 out wholesale destruction of Buddhist 
institutions, including their valuable 
libraries, manuscripts, and iconography.
 A few years after the invasion, the 
Arab scholar Alberuni traveled over 
northwest India, and in a book which he 
wrote, he put together considerable 
information concerning Indian religions,
 science, and philosophy. There was 
hardly any mention of Buddhism, however.
 In 1193 the Moslems attacked and 
conquered Magadha, the heartland of 
Buddhism, and with the destruction of 
the Buddhist monasteries in that area 
Buddhism was wiped out. With the 
disappearance of Buddhism as a vital 
religious and intellectual force in 
India, the flow of Indian missionaries 
to China and Chinese pilgrims to India 
practically came to a standstill."

"Indian Buddhism received its death-blow
 from Islam. As Gautama's doctrine 
relies on monarchism and monasteries, it
 was unable to survive the forcible 
<pb n="886"/>
destruction of its Indian viharas with 
their libraries and the slaughter of 
thousands of defenseless monks between 
712 and 1250. Its fate was sealed with 
the end of the Pala dynasty of Bengal 
when Buddhism lost its last royal 
patronage. Among the millions of 
inhabitants of India, there are today as
 few as four million followers of the 
Buddha's doctrine -- mainly former 
Harijans who in the Indian states of 
Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh were won 
over to Buddhism by the social reformer 
Dr. B. R. Ambedkar (1893-1956) and the 
movement founded by him. The remainder 
are the adherents of the Mahayana and 
the Tantrayana in the Indian Himalaya 
regions which are under the influence of
 Tibetan culture."

"In ancient India, and later in East 
Asia, one transcendental world dominated
 the faith and captured the imagination 
of
- millions. This is the land of the 
Buddha Amitabha, the Buddha-field called
 the 'Land of Bliss' or Sukhavati. This 
is indeed a world very different from 
other worlds. Not only is it a land of 
pure bliss, it is also a land of great 
<pb n="887"/>
marvels. Everything there happens as if 
by magic; rivers and forests are filled 
with precious jewels; birds sing 
expositions of the Buddha's teachings. 
In this land there is no evil or danger.
 One will not even find there the storms
 and inclement weather, nor even the 
rugged mountains and impassable forests,
 that made life in ancient India so 
harsh." 
"Very few treatises on Pure Land have 
been found in India. In fact the only 
extant work devoted exclusively to 
Amitabha Pure Land Buddhism is the fifth
 century work attributed to Vasubandhu (
Vn/ The Than) that survives only in its 
Chinese translation, the Rebirth 
Treatise. There are, however, a few 
older writings that comment on aspects 
of Pure Land doctrine. Among these, the 
earliest documents are attributed to 
Nagarjuna (hence, dated around 200 C.E.)
, the Ta Chih Tu Lun (Great Perfection 
of Wisdom Treatise; Vn/ Dai- Tri-Do Luan
) and the Commentary on the Dasabhwnika-
Sutra." 
NOTE:
"Buddhism was initially established as a
 reform movement opposed to vedic 
authority, brahmanic ritualism and the 
<pb n="888"/>
caste system of Hinduism. However in the
 ninth century Hinduism launched a 
counter-attack. Buddhist ideas were 
deliberately incorporated into Hinduism 
and the historical Buddha was declared 
an incarnation of the god Visnu. What

"Continental South East Asia the 
peninsula formerly known as Indo-China, 
has a predominantly Buddhist culture. 
There were two underlying foreign 
cultural influences prior to that of the
 West: that of India in the western part
 of peninsula; and that of China in the 
eastern part. The area of Indian 
cultural influence is Burma, Thailand, 
Cambodia and Laos. The area of Chinese 
cultural influence is thus considerably 
smaller, and is confined to Vietnam. 
Along with these two cultural sub-
divisions goes differentiation in the 
types of Buddhism: in the western part 
<pb n="889"/>
the predominant tradition is that of 
Theravada, while in Vietnam it is that 
of Mahayana."
Theravada Buddhism is also practiced in 
the southern part of Vietnam, near 
Cambodia. Thus, Vietnam is the only 
country where the two forms of Buddhism 
are substantially represented, although 
Mahayana is by far the dominant form.



<xa>INDONESIA</xa>
"Indonesia boasts the largest Buddhist 
monument in Southeast Asia: the massive 
stupa-temple of Borobodur on Java. There
 is also other evidence that various 
forms of Buddhism were transmitted to 
the region in the past but were eclipsed
 by the coming of Islam in the fifteenth
 century. Today, however, modest efforts
 are being made to revive both Theravada
 and Mahayana Buddhism there."

"The chief god of the Heaven of the

"In Vipasyana or Insight Meditation, the
 calmness and concentrative ability

penetratively into the true nature of 
things. Intense observation and analysis
 of phenomena encountered will, 
according to the classic texts, reveal 
that all are subject to duhkha (
suffering), anitya (impermanence) and 
anatman (no self), and are inherently 
painful or unsatisfactory, impermanent 
and devoid of atman or self -- or put 
simply: 'everything that arises passes 
away and is not self.' That is not mere 
head-knowledge but a deep existential 
understanding that is at once purifying 
and liberating. More positively, it is 
said to also give access to the 
Unconditioned: to Nirvana."

<pb n="892"/>
A mind of discrimination (intellect) is 
the ordinary mind subject to thoughts of
 right/wrong, correct/ incorrect, etc. 
The truth being one and indivisible in 
Buddhist teaching, a "discriminating" 
mind can never grasp the whole truth. 
Thus, such an approach is bound to 
result in an imperfect understanding of 
the world as it really is. This is best 
expressed by the parable of several 
blind men trying to describe an elephant
, each touching a different part of the 
animal, with no one having the total 
picture. 
In Buddhism, the higher levels of truth 
cannot be grasped through mere 
intellectual understanding or reasoning.
 In fact, at that level, all reasoning, 
based on our limited senses and 
faculties, is a hindrance. The Buddhist 
analogy is that of a person attempting 
to lift a chair while seated upon it! 
Editor/Van Hien: 210 Core principle of 
Buddhism: The teachings of the Buddhas 
have one supreme purpose -- to enable 
people to calm and purify the wandering,
 monkey mind. Once the mind is calm and 
pure, that is, free from the winds of 
greed, anger and delusion, it becomes a 
candle sheltered from the wind, 
<pb n="893"/>
radiating brightly (wisdom). 
"Although we do not necessarily need to 
know how and why something works in 
order for it to have an effect, the 
spirit of enquiry is generally healthy 
and helpful in one's spiritual life. We 
are likely to be more committed to 
spiritual practices and to make more 
effective use of them if we understand 
something of their meaning and function.
 Nonetheless, like many positive mental 
attitudes, the desire to know all about 
what we are getting into has a 'near 
enemy' and one to which Westerners are 
often prone. The 'near enemy' is that 
attitude which holds that we can fully 
penetrate the significance of things 
through the intellect alone, that once 
we have thoroughly conceptualized 
something, we know all there is to know 
about it. A Buddhist, avowedly striving 
towards a direct knowledge of reality 
which goes beyond all concepts, should 
of course not fall into this way of 
thinking." 

Pure land Buddhism
"An ancient master once said: Only two 
types of people can benefit from the 
Pure Land method. First are those 
<pb n="894"/>
completely ignorant and deluded but 
truthful and sincere individuals who, 
upon hearing the teaching, 
wholeheartedly believe, accept and begin
 to practice it. Second are those 
persons with deep wisdom and good roots 
in the Pure Land method who clearly 
understand noumenon and phenomena and 
the virtues achieved through Buddha 
Recitation and who therefore resolve to 
believe and practice it. On the other 
hand, those with ordinary intelligence 
can neither understand profoundly, nor 
do they have the simple belief of the 
completely deluded. Therefore, it is 
difficult for them to receive benefits."
(From Buddhism of Wisdom and Faith.) 



<xa>INTERPENETRATION，互攝</xa>
<_-xa>Avatamsaka Sutra</_-xa>

Basic teaching of the Avatamsaka Sutra 
which reveals the interpenetration of 
all dharmas -- the smallest dharma 
contains (i.e., has the essence of) the 
largest and vice versa. This teaching is
 clearly expressed in chapter 26 of the 
sutra, which describes the last phases 
<pb n="895"/>
of practice of a Bodhisattva before 
final Buddhahood. In that chapter, it is
 taught that at each and every stage, 
the actions of the Bodhisattva "never go
 beyond Buddha Recitation." 
Unimpeded Interpenetration
"In one speck of dust are lands as 
numerous as specks of dust;/ In each 
land are incalculable numbers of Buddhas
./ Each and every Buddha dwells in an 
assembly, Endlessly proclaiming all the 
practices of Bodhi./"
"In Ten Directions throughout the sea of
 lands,/ Every hairtip encompasses past,
 present and future./ So, too, there is 
a sea of Buddhas, a sea of Buddha lands;
/ Pervading them all, I cultivate for 
seas of endless time." 
These stanzas express a key concept in 
the Avatamsaka Sutra -- unimpeded 
interpenetration of phenomena (one mote 
of dust "contains" a multitude of worlds
) and unimpeded interpenetration of 
space and time (one hairtip "contains" 
the past, present and future).

<xa>JAPAN</xa>
<_-xa>Jodo School</_-xa>; <_-xa>Temples</_-xa>; <_-xa>Ji School</_-xa>

"Buddhism entered Japan (ca. 550) from 
Korea. The Empress Suiko became a 
<pb n="898"/>
convert, and the Prince Regent, known as
 Shotoku Taishi, did his best to 
encourage it. He drew up Japan's first 
Constitution, proclaiming the 'Three 
Treasures of Buddha, Dharma and Sangha' 
as the basis of the national life. From 
this time on, Japan took over and made 
her own the fruits of Chinese culture. 
In the ninth century, Dengyo Daishi, the
 founder of the Tendai school, and Kobo 
Daishi, the founder of the Shingon Sect,
 harmonized Buddhism with Shinto, 
producing the Ryobu Shinto, a fusion 
which lasted for a thousand years. In 
the twelfth century Honen brought the 
Jodo School to Japan, from which 
developed the Jodo Shin-Shu, founded by 
Shinran. About the same time, Nichiren 
founded his school which is based on the
 Lotus Sutra, and the two branches of 
Zen, Rinzai and Soto, were re-founded (
after the Chinese schools of the same 
name). In 1868, at the Meiji restoration
, Buddhism was (partly) disestablished. 
The largest schools today are Zen and 
Pure Land." 
(I) Pure Land School
"In Japan Amida worship was known from 
the time of the introduction of Buddhism
 in the sixth century. Records indicate 
<pb n="899"/>
that the Meditation Sutra was recited at
 the imperial court in 640 and that 
images of Amida and his two chief 
attendants, Avalokitesvara and 
Mahasthamaprapta, were brought from 
Korea in 689. Some seventh-century 
images of Amida and Kannon bear 
inscriptions indicating that they were 
votive offerings made oh behalf of 
parents. These findings substantiate the
 contention that early Amida worship 
occurred primarily... in Buddhist 
memorial services. Gyogi (670-749) and 
other seventh and eighth-century monks, 
though not followers of the Pure Land 
School exclusively, preached Amida's 
promise of salvation through faith, and 
the emperor Uda (866-931) is said to 
have died invoking Amida's name." 
The Pure Land school as presented in 
this book originated in India and is 
currently practiced in this form 
throughout Asia. In Japan, the school is
 divided into two major branches, the 
Jodo (Pure Land) school and the Jodo 
Shinshu (True Pure Land) school. While 
the teachings of the Jodo school are 
substantially the same as those 
described here, in the case of Jodo 
Shinshu (also known outside Japan as the
<pb n="900"/>
 Buddhist Churches of America), 
overwhelming emphasis is placed on Faith
 in Amitabha Buddha and His Original Vow
 to save all sentient beings. 
(II) Zen School
"In Japan, Zen was established in the 
early days of the Kamakura period (1185-
1335) when Eisai went to Sung China and 
brought back the teachings of the Lin-
chi school. Subsequently Dogen also went
 to Sung China and brought back the Ts'
ao-tung school's teachings. During the 
Kamakura and the Muromachi periods (1336
-1573), Zen teachings became connected 
with bushido or the way of the samurai 
and greatly prospered. In 1654, Ingen (
Chin Yin-yuan) came from Ming China to 
Japan and later founded the Obaku school
, (which combines Zen and Pure Land 
practices)." 
(III) Note
"In Japan, the ancient schools of 
Buddhism (Tendai, Avatamsaka, Zen, Pure 
Land ...) grew more and more into 
independent sects with their own 
organization and separate lay following.
 It is important not to read this 
Japanese development back into the 
classical Chinese situation. The ancient
 Chinese schools were much less 
<pb n="901"/>
institutionalized sectarian entities 
than their successors in Japan. In China
 there arose a movement towards 
syncretism which tended to unite the 
Buddhist sects and in some cases sought 
to harmonize the teachings of Buddhism 
with those of Taoism and Confucianism. 
This led to a much more integrated and 
united form of Buddhism. Japanese 
writers tend to view this as 
degeneration, but it can also be viewed 
as a successful victory for ecumenism...

</_-xa>
<pb n="903"/>

"A monastery near Sravasti presented to 
the Buddha by Anathapindika." 
Background:
"At the time of the Buddha's ministry, 
there was a wealthy merchant named 
Sudatta living in the kingdom of 
Sravasti. Because of his concern and 
generosity towards the less fortunate, 
he was given the epithet 'Anathapindika'
 or 'provider for widows and orphans'. 
It once happened that having invited the
 Buddha to preach in Sravasti, 
Anathapindika set about trying to find a
 suitable place for the World-honored 
One and his company of 1,250 monks. 
Determining that the estate of Prince 
Jeta, son of King Prasenajit, with its 
grassy fields and leafy trees, would be 
ideal, he approached the prince and 
offered to buy it. The prince, startled,
 said in jest, 'I am prepared' to sell 
you as much land as you can cover with 
gold.' Anathapindika remained silent for
 a moment, at which point the Prince 
laughed, 'That seems to be too much for 
you, does it not?' 'Why, no,' replied 
the merchant, 'I was simply considering 
which of my storehouses to take the gold
 from...' Later in the day, as the 
<pb n="904"/>
prince watched in amazement, bullock 
cart after bullock cart arrived at his 
estate, and the workers laid a carpet of
 gold upon the land, stretching in all 
directions. The only patches of ground 
which could not be covered were those 
where the trees stood. Prince Jeta, 
realizing that the Buddha must be an 
exceptional man, then decided to donate 
these patches of land. In honor of the 
two benefactors, the estate was 
henceforth known as the Garden of Jeta 
and Anathapindika.
"Here the Buddha spent nineteen rainy 
seasons. This monastery where the Buddha
 spent the major part of his life was 
the place where he delivered many of his
 sermons." 
In Buddhist literature, the name of 
Anathapindika has become synonymous with
 selfless, extreme generosity in the 
cause of the Dharma (building temples, 
printing sutras and commentaries, etc.)

<pb n="905"/>

<xa>JEWEL</xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Brahma Net</_-xa>; <_-xa>Indra's
 Net</_-xa>; <_-xa>Net of Indra</_-xa>

A famous metaphor found in the 
Avatamsaka Sutra. It illustrates the 
concept of unity and universal 
interdependence, the infinite mutual 
interrelationships among all things, the
 realm of non-interference between 
noumenon and phenomena and non-
interference among phenomena. 
"Far away in the heavenly abode of the 
great god Indra, there is a wonderful 
net which has been hung by some cunning 
artificer in such a manner that it 
stretches out infinitely in all 
directions. In accordance with the 
extravagant tastes of deities, the 
artificer has hung a single glittering 
jewel in each 'eye' of the net, and 
since the net itself is infinite in 
dimension, the jewels are infinite in 
number. There hang the jewels, 
glittering like stars of the first 
magnitude, a wonderful sight to behold.
If we now arbitrarily select one of 
these jewels for inspection and look 
closely at it, we will discover that in 
<pb n="906"/>
its polished surface there are reflected
 all the other jewels in the net, 
infinite in number. Not only that, but 
each of the jewels reflected in this one
 jewel is also reflecting all the other 
jewels, so that there is an infinite 
reflecting process occurring. The Hua-
Yen (Avatamsaka) school has been fond of
 this image, mentioned many times in its
 literature, because it symbolizes a 
cosmos in which there is an infinitely 
repeated interrelationship among all the
 members of the cosmos. This 
relationship is said to be one of 
simultaneous mutual identity and mutual 
intercausality." (Francis H. Cook, Hua-
Yen Buddhism)

"'Pure Land school' of Japanese Buddhism
. Headed by patriarch Honen (1133-1212).
 Although originally a Tendai monk, 
Honen embraced the Pure Land ideal 
primarily through the teachings of Shan-
<pb n="910"/>
tao after having become convinced that 
the Tendai path was becoming 
increasingly unworkable as a means for 
attaining salvation. Of course Pure Land
 teachings had been in Japan at least 
since the time of Ennin (794-864), who 
had studied it and other traditions 
while in China, but Honen is regarded as
 the founder. The textual basis of the 
school was the Larger and Smaller 
Sukhavativyuha Sutras, as well as the 
Meditation Sutra, and the religious 
practice focused on the recitation of 
the Buddha's name thus identifying it as
 an 'other-power' or 'easy path' (q.v.) 
approach to salvation. For Honen the 
formula 'Namu Amida Butsu' was a means 
of strengthening one's faith in Amitabha
, not merely an expression of trust, and
 was considered by him an appropriate 
religious practice in a period of Dharma
 decline (Dharma-Ending Age). Unlike its
 later offshoot, Jodo Shinshu, Honen's 
school continued the Buddhist monastic 
tradition. Honen's school was both 
threatening and alienating to the more 
formal and established Buddhist schools 
of the time, resulting in Honen's five-
year exile, terminated only one year 
prior to his death." 
<pb n="911"/>
(I)Background
"Having a deep desire to obtain 
salvation and with faith in the teaching
 of the various scriptures, I practiced 
many forms of self-discipline ... But 
the fact is I do not keep even the 
precepts, nor do I succeed in any one of
 the many forms of meditation ... Unless
 one gets free from evil conduct and 
evil passion how shall he obtain 
deliverance from the bondage of birth 
and death? Alas! alas! What shall I do? 
What shall I do? The like of us are 
incompetent to practice the three 
disciplines of the Precepts, Samadhi, 
and Wisdom. And so I inquired of a great
 many learned men and priests whether 
there is any other way to salvation than
 these disciplines, but no one could 
either teach me the way or even suggest 
it. At last I went into the library 
where all the Scriptures were, all by 
myself, and with a heavy heart read them
 all through. I hit upon a passage in 
Zendo's Commentary, which runs as 
follows: 'Only repeat the name of 
Amitabha with all your heart, whether 
walking or standing, whether sitting or 
lying. never cease the practice of it 
for a moment. This is the very work 
<pb n="912"/>
which unfailingly issues in salvation; 
for it is in accordance with the 
Original Vow of Amida Buddha."' 
(II) Note 
Pure Land Buddhism, based on the three 
elements of Faith, Vows and Practice, is
 currently practiced throughout East 
Asia -in China, Vietnam, Korea and other
 countries. In the case of Japan, Pure 
Land is mainly divided into two branches
, the Jodo (Pure Land) School and the 
Jodo Shinshu (True Pure Land) School. 
The teachings of the Jodo School (
founded by Honen, 1133-1212) are 
substantially the same as the teachings 
of traditional Pure Land. In the case of
 Jodo Shinshu (founded by Honen's best 
known disciple Shinran, 1173-1262, and 
represented in the United States by the 
Buddhist Churches of America), 
overwhelming emphasis is placed on Faith
.

"Japanese for 'True Pure Land school.' A
 school of Pure Land founded by Shinran 
(Honen's best known disciple), based on 
the belief that (exclusive) reliance on 
the power of Amida, rather than one's 
own power, is the determining factor in 
achieving salvation. Jodo Shin rejects 
the monastic rules of traditional Jodo, 
permitting its priests to eat meat, live
 as laymen, marry, etc. Shinran stressed
 faith in Buddha Recitation, holding 
that too much emphasis on repeated 
recitation implies a tendency to rely on
 one's own power, rather than Amitabha's
 grace. He held that even the 
practitioner's longing for salvation is 
given by Amitabha, as opposed to Honen's
 Jodo (q.v.) school which teaches that a
 believing mind is, strictly speaking, a
 part of one's own effort. 
Shinran propagated his teachings in 
Kyoto and in the Kanto area, but the 
school gained little influence during 
his lifetime. After his death, a 
mausoleum was built in Higashiyama (
Eastern Hills) in Kyoto by his daughter 
<pb n="914"/>
Kakushin the Nun and his disciples. This
 later became Nishi (West) Hongan-ji, 
the head temple of the school. In the 
fifteenth century, the Jodo Shin school 
spread widely because of the efforts of 
Rennyo, the eighth chief priest of 
Hongan-ji." 
(I) Background
While the Jodo (Pure Land) school in 
Japan is identical to the Pure Land 
School in China, Vietnam, and other 
Asian countries, Jodo Shinshu (or Shin) 
is an exclusively Japanese school. It 
differs from Jodo in several ways, to 
wit: (1) The clergy is allowed to marry.
 (2) The position of supreme head of the
 Church is hereditary, passed on from 
father to son. (3) Jodo Shinshu 
emphasizes faith to the exclusion of 
everything else. For example, the rosary
 worn on the wrist of Jodo Shin devotees
 is not used to count recitation but is 
a symbol of gratitude for the grace of 
the Buddha Amitabha.
"The nembutsu (recitation of the Buddha'
s name) then becomes an expression of 
gratitude to Amida for the gift of faith
 that leads to birth in the Pure Land, 
rather than a meritorious act that can 
affect rebirth." (J. Okazaki, Pure Land 
<pb n="915"/>
Buddhist Painting, p. 23.) 
(II) Note
"As many writers have pointed out, 
Shinran was the Martin Luther of Japan, 
both in leading the way out of the 
monastic life and in preaching salvation
 through faith alone."

<xa>KALAYASAS</xa>
<_-xa>Meditation Sutra</_-xa>

"A monk from Central Asia went to China

 translated, inter alia, the Meditation 
Sutra, one of the Three Pure Land Sutras
 (q.v.). Died in 442 at the age of 60." 



<xa>KALPA，劫</xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Eternity</_-xa>; <_-xa>Eon</_-xa>
; <_-xa>Empty Eon</_-xa>
<_-xa>Cosmology (Buddhist)</_-xa>

"The nearest approach to the conception 
of eternity in Buddhist thought is the 
kalpa (Sanskrit), which is an 
inconceivably long period of time. The 
kalpa is divided into four parts: period
 of world-dissolution; period of chaos; 
<pb n="917"/>
period of world-formation; period of 
world-continuation. A simile, used in a 
discourse of Buddha, is as follows: '
Suppose, O monks, there was a huge rock 
of one solid mass, one mile long, one 
mile wide, one mile high, without split 
or flaw. And at the end of every 100 
years a man should come and rub against 
it with a silken cloth. Then that huge 
rock would wear off and disappear 
quicker than a Kalpa.' Of such world-
periods, according to Buddha, there have
 been many hundred thousands. In the 
Buddhist view of things, there is no 
limitation to the process of world-
dissolution, chaos, world-formation and 
world-continuation, nor to the number of
 Buddhas who will appear in the course 
of this process." 
"The period required for a celestial 
woman to wear away a stone of ten cubic 
miles if she touched it with her 
garments once every three years. Of the 
three kinds of kalpa, that period is a 
small kalpa; Twenty small kalpas make a 
medium kalpa, and four medium kalpas 
make a large kalpa." 
"In Buddhism, a kalpa generally 
indicates the length of time between the
 creation and recreation of a world or 
<pb n="918"/>
universe, spanning the period of a world
's formation, existence, destruction, 
and non-existence. There are different 
interpretations of measurement of a 
kalpa in Buddhism. It often simply 
denotes a very long period of time, 
similar to an aeon. There are small, 
medium, great, and incalculable kalpas."
 
NOTE:
"According to conventional reckoning, a 
small kalpa would be equivalent to 16.8 
million years and a large or great kalpa
 1,347 million."

<xa>KARMA，業</xa>
<_-xa>No Good Deed Goes Unpunished</_-xa>
Action leading to future retribution or 
reward, in current or future lifetimes. 
Common karma: the difference between 
personal and common karma can be seen in
 the following example: Suppose a 
country goes to war to gain certain 
economic advantages and in the process, 
numerous soldiers and civilians are 
killed or maimed. If a particular 
citizen volunteers for military service 
and actually participates in the carnage
, he commits a personal karma of killing
. Other citizens, however, even if 
opposed to the war, may benefit directly
 or indirectly (e.g., through economic 
gain). They are thus said to share in 
<pb n="923"/>
the common karma of killing of their 
country. 
Fixed karma: in principle, all karma is 
subject to change. Fixed karma, however,
 is karma which can only be changed in 
extraordinary circumstances, because it 
derives from an evil act commited 
simultaneously with mind, speech, and 
body. An example of fixed karma would be
 a premeditated crime (versus a crime of
 passion). 
'The doctrine of karma is subtle and 
exceedingly intricate. Reduced to its 
most elementary meaning, karma is action
; it refers also to the fruits of action
. It may be seen as the law of causation
 on a personal level, a combination of 
primary and secondary causes. In the 
case of a plant, for example, the seed 
is the primary cause, and rain, wind, 
sunlight, etc., are the secondary causes
. Similarly, every thought, utterance, 
and deed is a seed that ripens over time
 until, under suitable conditions, it 
comes to fruition as an event or 
circumstance. It is, moreover, a 
continuous process, for the way in which
 one responds to these circumstances 
determines the quality of his present 
life as well as future ones. Thus the 
<pb n="924"/>
doctrine of karma repudiates any notion 
of 'fate' or 'fixed destiny,' inasmuch 
as these circumstances and our response 
to them are constantly changing. Clearly
, then, everyone has the potential at 
each moment to alter the course of his 
future karma. Within the period of a 
single lifetime, however, every being 
has in addition to his mutable karma a 
particular 'fixed karma', as for example
 the species, race, and sex into which 
he is born. These karmic traits, though 
set for life, are then recast at the 
next rebirth in accordance with the 
individual's ever-ripening past actions.
 Although we often speak of 'good' and '
bad' (painful) karma, the term is 
generally used in reference to the 
latter, as when selfish actions, for 
instance, are called 'karma-producing.' 
Karma means that everything that happens
 to us, without exception, we ourselves 
directly or indirectly, partly or 
entirely, set in motion at some time in 
the past. The Buddha said, 'If you want 
to know the past (cause), look at your 
present (effect). If you want to know 
the future (effect), look at your 
present (cause).' The answer to the 
familiar refrain, 'What have I done to 
<pb n="925"/>
deserve this?' is always 'plenty!' Yet 
suffering can also follow from the 
collective karma, in which each member 
of a group reaps what the group as a 
whole has sown. And when the 
conditioning causes of one's karma, 
whether that karma is of hardship and 
disgrace or fortune and honor, are 
exhausted, it will disappear."

Poverty and want, for example, are the 
results of miserly thoughts and actions 
in past lives. For a destitute person to
 cheat and steal in order to escape 
poverty and become wealthy is a classic 
case of creating more evil karma in the 
hope of escaping retribution. 
Pure Land Buddhism
All evil karma results, ultimately, from
 delusion, the antithesis of 
enlightenment. Such practice as Buddha 
Recitation leads ultimately to 
enlightenment and thus dissolves away 
evil karma. It is as though a house were
 boarded up for ten thousand years. As 
soon as a window is opened, eons of 
darkness disappear in a split second. 
The dissolution of evil karma through 
Buddha Recitation can be explained in 
another way:
<pb n="926"/>
"A non-individualistic interpretation of
 the law of karma is provided by the 
doctrine of parinamana or 'turning over'
 of merits. According to this doctrine, 
the merits which one person has acquired
 by the performance of good actions, can
, if he so wishes, be transferred to 
another ... By sincerely invoking 
Amitabha Buddha's name, which is in 
reality identical with Amitabha himself,
 we identify ourselves with Amitabha. As
 a result of this identification, a 
portion of his merits is transferred to 
us.
These merits, which are now ours, are 
sufficient not only to counterbalance 
the effects of our evil actions but also
 to ensure our rebirth in the Pure Land.
 The law of karma has not been suspended
 for our benefit. All that has happened 
is that a more powerful karma has 
cancelled out one that was weaker." (as 
quoted by Sangharakshita) 
NOTE:
"Devotional Buddhism does not maintain 
that rebirth in the Pure Land takes 
place without a cause, but that the 
primary factor in its causation is the 
invocation of the name of Amitabha. 
Hence this school cannot be regarded as 
<pb n="927"/>
denying the general principle of 
causality."

; <_-xa>Suicide</_-xa>; <_-xa>Immolation</_-xa>

The first Buddhist precept, binding upon
 clergy and laity alike, is not to kill 
-- and this includes not to kill oneself
:
"A monk who intentionally deprives a 
human being of his life, or provides the
 means for suicide, or praises death, or
 incites one to commit suicide, saying, 
'Of what use to you is this evil, 
difficult life? Death is better for you 
than life,' thus having his mind set on 
the other's death and with the idea that
 he should die, praises death in various
 ways or incites him to commit suicide, 
commits an offense entailing loss of 
<pb n="934"/>
monkhood." (Vinaya Pitaka, as quoted in 
World Scripture, p.343). 
"Whereas the commandment 'Thou shalt not
 kill' is ordinarily interpreted to mean
 'Thou shalt not kill humans,' the 
Buddhist perspective includes all forms 
of animal life as well. To refrain from 
killing means to abstain from killing 
any sentient being, including even 
cockroaches and ants. Each living 
creature is as attached to its life as 
any other, as we can
<_-xa>when they scurry away. In 
institutions such as the Society for 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and in 
sayings such as 'She's so kind, she 
wouldn't kill a fly,' we see that the 
notion of non-harm often extends to non-
human life forms in Western culture, too
. Thus, Buddhism reaffirms some of our 
own cultural ideals." </_-xa>
(I) Self- Defense
"Question: What if someone is trying to 
harm me physically or mentally, and in 
trying to prevent this I hurt him or her
, do I violate the first precept against
 killing? 
Answer: You violate the precept. In kung
 fu, even though you may have lethal 
power, if you are attacked, you run away
<pb n="935"/>
. If you can't run away, you avoid. You 
do this dance so they can't get you. If 
you can't avoid, you disarm; take the 
weapon away from them. If you can't 
disarm you maim, to slow them down.

The last resort is to kill, to use your 
power in a lethal way. If you do that to
 protect yourself, you violate the 
precept, because it is a self-centered 
action. If you do that to protect 
someone else, you uphold the precept." 
(II) Abortion
"In a discussion of the first precept, 
the subject of abortion is bound to 
arise. The issue of abortion, as you 
know, has long been the subject of 
bitter public debate. At one extreme are
 those who insist, 'All life is sacred, 
even a human embryo!' These people rage 
against the 'murderous mind' of those 
who would deny 'the right of life' to 
the unborn child, insisting that 'since 
only God can give life, only He can take
 it away.' It may be asked: Are these 
same individuals just as vociferous in 
demanding a decent life for those 
already born who are undernourished and 
exploited? On the other side are those 
who insist that a pregnant woman alone 
<pb n="936"/>
has the right to decide whether to bear 
her fetus. To women who cry, 'This is my
 body, I can do with it as I please!' I 
would ask, 'How can you say it is your 
body when you cannot control the 
circulation of your blood, of your 
heartbeat, your thoughts, aging, or 
death? Clearly your body has its own law
, which it obeys independently of your 
wishes. True, in a limited sense it is 
your body, for it is the outcome of your
 karma, of your volitional thoughts and 
actions in this life and previous ones. 
But don't forget that your karma also 
includes your biological inheritance 
from your parents. Moreover, it is not 
just by chance, as you may think, that 
the particular fetus within you was 
conceived. In the profoundest sense, its
 conception is the expression of the 
karmic affinity between you and the 
fetus: your need to provide it with a 
body and its need to be reborn through 
you.' Make no mistake, abortion is a 
grave matter. Even when the danger of 
the mother's physical death is remote, 
as in modern clinics, the spiritual 
dying that accompanies an abortion can 
be real and painful. For a spiritually 
sensitive woman who realizes she is the 
<pb n="937"/>
means through which a particular being 
can be reborn in human form -- that form
 which is so hard to obtain -- to 
acquiesce in the aborting of that 
incipient life can be a soul-scarring 
experience, just as bearing a wanted 
child in happy circumstances can be a 
source of tremendous joy. Many women, 
and men too, have asked my advice about 
abortion. I have seen and heard the 
delight of those who, though having 
contemplated an abortion, decided to 
have the child, and I have observed 
sorrow etched in the faces of many who 
did have an abortion."
(III) Suicide/Sacrifice
Killing sentient beings, including 
slaughtering animals for food, is among 
the heaviest transgressions in Buddhism.
 This is not only because such acts 
create untold suffering but also because
 they cut short the lives of future 
Buddhas (as all sentient beings have a 
common Buddha Nature). The injunction 
against all forms of killing (including 
suicide), covering all sentient beings, 
is unique to Buddhism. Jainism, for 
example, approves of the penance of 
death by self-starvation (suicide), 
while Hindu ceremonies such as the 
<pb n="938"/>
Srauta rites "center on offering into 
the altar fires oblations of milk, 
butter, honey .. domestic animals ..." (
sacrifice). K. Crim, Dictionary of 
Religions, p. 369 and 790, respectively.

(IV) Animal Slaughter
"To intentionally deprive any living 
being, but especially a human being, of 
life will produce painful karma. 
Slaughterers as well as hunters and 
fishermen -especially those motivated by
 sport alone -- inevitably incur a heavy
 karma. Those who do experimental 
research on animals, often depriving 
them of their lives, also risk painful 
karma. The destruction of animals in 
such experimentation is justified on the
 ground that it is the only way by which
 to gain information vital to the health
 and welfare of human beings. 
Unfortunately, much animal 
experimentation today is undertaken 
without consideration of alternative, 
more humane methods. Such an unfeeling 
attitude may arise from the belief that 
animals, being less developed than man, 
suffer less. But who would deny that 
animals, too, suffer pain acutely and 
try to avoid it as much as humans? And 
<pb n="939"/>
precisely because their minds are less 
complex than man's and they are more 
intuitive, animals are more sensitive to
 impending violence and pain, which 
generates in them fear that prolongs 
their suffering. Porphyry, a Greek 
philosopher of the fourth century, wrote
 that anyone who had heard the scream of
 an animal being slaughtered could never
 again eat animal flesh."

"Kisagotami was married to a banker's 
son of considerable wealth. As a young 
wife, Kisagotami was mistreated by her

When she gave birth to a son, she 
finally received an honorable place 
among her husband's relatives. But her 
child died while still a toddler, and 
Kisagotami, who had never seen death 
before, went mad. In her state of 
insanity, Kisagotami took up the dead 
child and carried him on her hip from 
house to house, begging for medicine. 
One kind old man directed her to the 
Buddha. The Buddha said, 'Go and bring a
 white mustard seed from a house where 
no one has died.' Hearing his words, she
 immediately rushed off in the innocent 
faith that if she brought a white 
mustard seed to this enlightened sage, 
it would be the medicine that could 
miraculously bring her child back to 
life. Kisagotami went from house to 
house, at each house asking, and at each
 house learning that there too, someone 
had died. The truth struck home. Her 
sanity returned. 'Little son,' she said.
<pb n="941"/>
 'I thought that death had happened to 
you alone; but it is not to you alone. 
It is common to all people.' Then, still
 holding the body of her child in her 
arms, she carried him gently to the 
forest and left him there."

study, students of Zen may open their 
minds to the truth. By this method they 
may attain the same inner experience as 
the Zen masters. It is said that there 
are one thousand seven hundred such 
koans on record. The term wato (hua-t'ou

to which all doubts and delusions are 
laid aside. At the same time you ask '
Who is this person reciting the Amitabha
's name?' When you rely steadily on the 
koan, all illusions and confused 
thoughts will be broken down the way 
knotted threads are cut. When there is 
no longer any place for them to reappear
, it is like the shining sun in the sky.
 When illusion does not arise and 
delusions disappear, the mind is all 
calm and transparent." 
"The business of studying Zen is the 
epitome of the mystic device of 
transcendence. It is not possible for 
those who take it easy. You must 
generate great bravery and great energy.
 You also must stop thoughts, forget 
entangling objects and gather in your 
seeing and hearing and turn them back (
onto inherent reality). You must take 
your everyday views of good and evil, 
your likes and dislikes, and your 
sentiments of affirmation and denial and
 totally sweep them away ... It is like 
one man battling ten thousand men: there
 is no time to blink, no time to 
hesitate in doubt. If you can really 
<pb n="944"/>
generate this kind of adamant, fierce 
will power, you have the mettle to study
 Zen. Once you have the mettle to study 
Zen, take hold of the phrase 'Amitabha 
Buddha' as if you were resting on the 
Polar Mountain and cannot be shaken. 
Concentrate your mind and unify your 
attention. Recite the Buddha-name a few 
times, turn the light back and observe 
yourself, asking: Who is this one 
reciting the Buddha-name? (J.C. Cleary, 
tr., Pure Land, Pure Mind.)" 
NOTE: 
The Koan of Buddha Recitation is 
basically a Zen practice. For the Pure 
Land view, see "Pure Land Buddhism (

<_-xa>Boddhisattva</_-xa>

"'Earth Repository'; name of a 
Bodhisattva who saves suffering beings 
in the hells; especially popular in 
Japan as the saviour of the souls of 
<pb n="947"/>
dead children; particularly aborted ones
." 
Usually represented standing, holding in
 his right hand a pilgrim's staff, and 
in his left a pearl.

Background
"Ksitigarbha or 'Earth-Womb' is more 
popular in the Far East than he ever was
 in India. From a bare mention in the 
roll of the Eight Bodhisattvas, he has 
risen, in Asia, and especially East Asia
, to a popularity second only to that of
 Avalokitesvara. The reasons for this 
development are obscure. As his name 
suggests, Ksitigarbha is connected with 
the depths. Like all Bodhisattvas, he 
aspires to deliver sentient beings 
wandering astray in the five (or six) 
paths of mundane existence; but he 
specializes in delivering them from hell
. This expresses an extremely profound 
and esoteric aspect of the Bodhisattva's
 compassionate activity: he takes upon 
himself the fearful task not merely of 
plumbing the depths of existence, and 
bringing relief and consolation to those
 in torment, but of personally 
transforming and uplifting the vast 
inchoate mass of fear, hatred and 
<pb n="948"/>
despair swarming and pullulating in the 
pitch darkness of the Abyss. He is that 
loving 'compassion' of the highest to 
the lowest which, abandoning its own 
bright seat, does not shrink from 
working under conditions the most 
difficult and appalling -- amidst scenes
 of horror, madness and desolation -- at
 the seemingly hopeless task of 
reclaiming what is 'irrecoverably' lost.
 Ksitigarbha is the principle of 
spiritual sublimation in its most 
radical aspect, powerful enough to 
transform not merely hell into heaven 
but the foulest dregs of the Samsara, 
even, into the pure radiance of Nirvana.
 He is the supreme embodiment of 
spiritual optimism, the most profound 
development of Mahayana universalism, 
which wills that not so much as a grain 
of dust should be left outside the 
scheme of salvation." 
Famous Quote
"Not until the hells are emptied will I 
become a Buddha; Not until all beings 
are saved will I certify to Bodhi." (
Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva)

Illustrative story:
For a glimpse of why we should not 
blindly borrow the words of the sages or
 emulate their extraordinary actions,
<_-xa>the following passage concerning 
Kumarajiva, the renowned T'ang Dynasty 
monk: "When Kumarajiva went to China in 
the fourth century of this era, the 
Chinese Emperor thought that such a wise
 person ought to have descendents so 
that his wisdom would carry on. He gave 
concubines to Kumarajiva, and since they
 were a royal gift, Kumarajiva had no 
choice but to accept them. Afterwards, 
his disciples asked, 'Can we have . 
relations with women too?' Kumara said, 
Sure, but first, let me show you 
something.' He took a handful of needles
 and ate them as easily as they were 
noodles. When he finished, he said, 'If 
you can do that, then you can have 
relations with women.'" (Sheng-yen, The 
Sword of Wisdom, p. 229.) </_-xa>
NOTE:
"Kumarajiva interpreted Amida Buddha as 
an expression of sunyata (emptiness) and
<pb n="951"/>
 recommended nembutsu (Buddha Recitation

Now we may be forgiven for wondering

learn that the sports or games are those
 of the Buddha, that we have here a 
sutra which offers us what we may say is
 the Buddha's playful nature. The Lalita
-vistara recounts various incidents of 
the Buddha's career which were to him '
child's play', incidents in which he 
acted freely, easily, naturally, 
spontaneously--in other words, in a 
truly spiritual manner. So this sutra is
 a kind of biography of the Buddha, but 
it is not biography as we usually 
understand the term, because it contains
 a great deal of what scholars like to 
call 'legendary material'. But this is 
not just 'legend': the Lalita-vistara

their attaining liberation is not 
discounted. The ideal figure of the 
Mahayana, the Bodhisattva, is a 
layperson. In China, formal ordination 
of lay adherents, usually as part of a 
ceremony for ordaining monks, is common.
 Lay ordination consists of taking the '

all or some of the Five Shilas (Five 
Precepts). Advance lay adherents 
sometimes go on to take the Bodhisattva 
Precepts (q.v.) after lay ordination."

Illustrative Story
A story about the Bodhisattva Maitreya 
illustrates the Buddhist concept of "
<pb n="964"/>
letting go". In a time long past, 
Maitreya was in his incarnation as a 
laughing, big-bellied monk with a sack 
perpetually on his back. He used to 
travel about the countryside seeking 
alms and sharing them with whomever 
happened to be nearby. He would 
customarily sit under a tree, surrounded
 by urchins, to whom he would tell 
stories to illustrate Buddhist teachings
. Seeing this, an elder monk of the time
 became annoyed at what he perceived as 
untoward conduct on the part of Maitreya
. One day, he cornered Maitreya and 
tried to test him with the following 
question: "Old monk, pray tell me, just 
what do you think is the essence of the 
Buddha's teachings?" Maitreya stopped 
for a moment, looked him in the eye, and
 just let his sack fall to the ground. 
As the puzzled monk wondered what to 
make of this singular action, Maitreya 
bent down, picked up his sack and walked
 away. r. Dropping the sack, "letting go
"
forgive and forget -- that is the 
teaching of Maitreya, the future Buddha.

malevolent and have potent spiritual 
powers. They correspond to such beings 
as trolls, bogies, and the little people

moments. Such beings often grant wishes

that they deceive humans into supplying 
them with offerings." 



<xa>LIBERATION</xa>
<_-xa>Rebirth in the Pure Land</_-xa>

"In this Dharma-Ending Age, if we 
practice other methods without following
 Pure Land at the same time, it is 
difficult to attain emancipation in this
 very lifetime. If emancipation is not 
achieved in this lifetime, deluded as we
<pb n="966"/>
 are on the path of Birth and Death, all
 of our crucial vows will become empty 
thoughts. This is a cardinal point which
 the cultivator should keep in mind. 
Those practitioners who follow other 
schools, stressing only self-help and a 
firm, never-changing mind, believe that 
we should just pursue our cultivation 
life after life. Even if we do not 
achieve emancipation in this life, we 
shall certainly do so in a future 
lifetime. However, there is one thing we
 should consider: Do we have any firm 
assurances that in the next lifetime, we
 will continue cultivating? For, if we 
have not yet attained Enlightenment, we 
are bound to be deluded upon rebirth, 
easily forgetting the vow to cultivate 
which we made in our previous lifetimes.
 Moreover, in this world, conditions 
favoring progress in the Way are few, 
while the opportunities for 
retrogression are many. How many monks 
and nuns have failed to pursue their 
cultivation upon rebirth...? The sutras 
state: 'Even Bodhisattvas are deluded in
 the bardo stage, even Sravakas are 
deluded at birth.'. In the interval 
between the end of this current life and
 the beginning of the next life, even 
<pb n="967"/>
Bodhisattvas are subject to delusion, if
 they have not yet attained (a high 
degree of) Enlightenment. Another 
passage in the sutras states: 'Common 
mortals are confused and deluded when 
they enter the womb, reside in the womb,
 and exit from the womb. Celestial kings
, thanks to their merits, are awake upon
 entering the womb, but are confused and
 deluded when residing in or exiting 
from the womb. Sravakas are awake when 
they enter and reside in the womb; 
however, they are confused and deluded 
when they exit from the womb. Only those
 Bodhisattvas who have attained the 
Tolerance of Non-Birth are always awake 
-- entering, residing in, and exiting 
from the womb.' In a few instances, 
ordinary people, because of special 
karmic conditions, are able to remember 
their previous lives, but these are very
 rare occurrences. Or else, they could 
be Bodhisattvas who took human form in 
order to demonstrate the existence of 
transmigration to sentient beings. 
Otherwise, all sentient beings are 
deluded when they pass from one life to 
another. When they are in such a state, 
all their knowledge of the Dharma and 
their great vows from previous lives are
<pb n="968"/>
 hidden by delusion and often forgotten.
 'This author recalls the story of a 
Dharma colleague. In his youth, each 
time he happened to be dreaming, he 
would see himself floating freely, high 
up in the air, travelling everywhere. As
 he grew older, he could only float 
lower and lower, until he could no 
longer float at all. In the commentary 
Guide to Buddhism, there is the story of
 a layman who, at the age of four or 
five, could see everything by night as 
clearly as in the daytime. As the years 
went by, this faculty diminished. From 
the age of ten onward, he could no 
longer see in the dark, except that from
 time to time, if he happened to wake up
 in the middle of the night, he might 
see clearly for a few seconds. After his
 seventeenth birthday, he could 
experience this special faculty only 
once every two or three years; however, 
his special sight would be merely a 
flash before dying out. Such persons had
 cultivated in their previous lives. 
However, when they were reborn on this 
earth they became deluded, and then, as 
their attachments grew deeper, their 
special faculties diminished.
There are similar cases of persons who 
<pb n="969"/>
can see everything clearly for a few 
dozen miles around them. Others can see 
things underground, through walls, or in
 people's pockets. However, if they do 
not pursue cultivation, their special 
faculties diminish with time and, in the
 end, they become just like everyone 
else. Some persons, having read a book 
once, can close it and recite every line
 without a single mistake. Others have a
 special gift for poetry, so that 
whatever they say or write turns poetic.
 However, if they do not pursue 
cultivation, they sometimes end by 
rejecting the Dharma. An eminent Master 
once commented that such persons had 
practiced meditation in their previous 
lives to a rather high level and reached
 a certain degree of attainment. However
, following the Zen tradition, they 
sought only immediate awakening to the 
True Nature, severing attachment to the 
concepts of Buddha and Dharma (i.e., 
letting the mind be empty, recognizing 
no Buddha and no Dharma). Therefore, 
those who failed to attain Enlightenment
 were bound to undergo rebirth in the 
Triple Realm, whereupon, relying on 
their mundane intelligence, they 
sometimes became critical of Buddhism. 
<pb n="970"/>
Even true cultivators in the past were 
thus; how would today's practitioners 
fare compared to them? As Buddha 
Sakyamuni predicted, 'In the Dharma-
Ending Age, cultivators are numerous, 
but those who can achieve Supreme 
Enlightenment are few.' And, not having 
achieved it, even with bad karma as 
light as a fine silk thread, they are 
subject to Birth and Death. Although 
there may be a few cultivators who have 
awakened to the Way, being awakened is 
different from attaining Supreme 
Enlightenment. During rebirth, they are 
bound to be deluded and unfree. In 
subsequent lifetimes, there may be few 
conditions for progress and many 
opportunities for retrogression, making 
it difficult to preserve the vow of 
liberation intact."

Famous Chinese Ch'an (Zen) master, a 
student of Hung-Po. At the time of the 
great persecution of Buddhists in China 
from 842 to 845, he founded the school 
named after him, the Lin-chi school (Jap

 the next centuries, this was to be not 
only the most influential school of Ch'
an but also the most vital school of 
Buddhism in China. With the Soto school,
 it is one of the two schools of Zen. In
 the tradition of Ma-tsu Tao-i, his '
grandfather in Zen,' Lin-chi made use of
 such supportive means as the sudden 
shout and unexpected blows with a stick 
as well as with a flywhisk. Of these he 
was best-known for his use of the shout.
 The single new element in methodology 
that entered Zen after Lin-chi was the 
koan." 
"One of two important schools of Chan/
<pb n="974"/>
Zen. The Lin-Chi (Rinzai) school 
stresses the importance of Sudden 
Enlightenment and advocates unusual 
means of achieving it, such as shouts, 
slaps, and the use of koans. Lin-Chi (
Rinzai) uses collections of koans 
systematically in its temples and 
downplays the reading of scriptures (
sutras) and the veneration of Buddha 
images in favor of seeking the Buddha 
Nature directly through the use of koans
 and practical living."

"Translated into Chinese in 252 by

two fascicles. There were twelve Chinese
 translations of this sutra, only five 
now being extant. Its Sanskrit text was 
published by Max Mueller (l9th c.) and

., the scene of the dialogue is placed 
at Rajagrha, India, and the Buddha, 
Ananda, and Maitreya are introduced as 
the principal speakers -- the subject 
being the description of the Pure Land, 
together with the history of Amitabha 
Buddha from his early stage as a bhiksu 
under the name Dharmakara. Also this 
sutra explains the cause and effect 
through which human beings attain 
Buddhahood in the Pure Land by invoking 
the name Amitabha." 
(I) Synopsis/Summary
"The Longer Amitabha Sutra ... which was
<pb n="979"/>
 in existence before A.D. 200, describes
 a discourse offered by the Buddha 
Sakyamuni... in response to questions of
 his disciple Ananda. Sakyamuni tells 
the story of the Bodhisattva Dharmakara,
 who had for eons past been deeply moved
 by the suffering of sentient beings and
 who had determined to establish a Land 
of Bliss where all beings could 
experience emancipation from their pain 
... In the presence of the eighty-first 
Buddha of the past, Lokesvararaja, 
Dharmakara made forty-eight vows 
relating to this Paradise, and promised 
that he would not accept enlightenment 
if he could not achieve his goals ... 
When, after countless ages, Dharmakara 
achieved enlightenment and became a 
Buddha, the conditions of his (l8th) vow
 were fulfilled: he became the Lord of 
Sukhavati, the Western Paradise, where 
the faithful will be reborn in bliss, 
there to progress through stages of 
increasing awareness until they finally 
achieve enlightenment." (Elizabeth ten 
Grotenhuis, in Joji Okazaki, Pwe Lanci 
Buddhist Painting, p. 14-15.) 
The text of the sutra begins with Buddha
 on Vulture's Peak surrounded by a huge 
retinue of sravakas (i.e., hearers, 
<pb n="980"/>
disciples) and Bodhisattvas. Using the 
premise of instructing Ananda, Buddha 
tells the story of a monk Dharmakara who
 made a series of forty-eight vows under
 a prior Buddha known as Lokesvara. 
Dharmakara begins pursuit of the 
Bodhisattva path, focusing all his vows 
in one Buddha-Land. Eventually, 
Dharmakara is able to actualize his vows
, becoming the Buddha Amitabha residing 
in the Pure Land of Sukhavati (the 
Western Paradise). Rebirth in Sukhavati 
is available to those who (1) make a vow
 to be reborn there and (2) meditate on 
Amitabha, or recite his name (with 
utmost faith and sincerity). The sutra 
ends with a vision of Amitabha." 
(II) Note
"We should know that Amitabha Buddha has
 great affinities (causes and conditions
) with this world. As the Longer 
Amitabha Sutra states: "In the Dharma-
Ending Age, when all other sutras have 
disappeared, only this sutra will remain
 for another hundred years to rescue 
sentient beings and lead them to the 
Western Pure Land."

The Lotus Flower is a symbol of Buddhism
. Three characteristics of the flower 
are: "(1) The petals are made to bear 
the fruit. In the same manner, expedient
 teachings are expounded in order to 
reveal the true teaching. (2) When the 
lotus-flower opens, the fruit is seen 
therein. In the same manner, we find the
 true teaching latent in the expedient 
teachings. (3) When the fruit is ripened
, the flower falls. In the same manner, 
when the true teaching is established, 
the expedient teachings are no longer 
necessary." 
The lotus flower grows out of the mud 
<pb n="982"/>
but is not sullied by mud (the Buddha 
although originally a sentient being, is
 undefiled by the Saha World. Also: 
Buddhism has its roots in the Truth of 
suffering but transcends suffering). The
 lotus is moreover the only plant in 
which flower and fruit co-exist 
simultaneously (Cause and Effect exist 
simultaneously in all phenomena, 
according to Buddhist teachings).

NOTE:
"The lotus or sea-rose is of almost 
unique importance in Chinese folklore 
and symbolism thanks largely, it would 
seem, to Buddhist influence: the lotus 
comes out of the mud but is not itself 
sullied; it is inwardly empty, outwardly
 upright; it has no branches but it 
smells sweet; it is the symbol of purity
, and one of the eight Buddhist precious
 things."

<pb n="983"/>

The levels of rebirth in the Western 
Pure Land as described in the Meditation
 Sutra, a key Pure Land text. According 
to this sutra, there are nine grades, 
divided into three sets of three grades 
each. The more merits and virtues the 
practitioner accumulates, the higher the
 grade. However, according to the 
commentaries, the grades can also be 
considered as infinite in number, 
corresponding to the infinite levels of 
karma of those who are reborn in the 
Pure Land. 
Rebirth Mudras
In Pure Land iconography, the grade of 
rebirth of a practitioner is indicated 
by the mudras adopted by Amitabha Buddha
 as He appears at the believer's death-
bed (Raigo). The following text 
describes the mudras corresponding to 
the six lower grades of rebirth -- the 
levels most commonly attained by earnest
 practitioners.

"(1) Middle Class: Lower Life is 
represented by the two hands held in 
front of the breast, each one forming 
the an-i-in (Mudra of Peace and Good 
Will), while the ring fingers and thumbs
<pb n="984"/>
 touch to form mystic circles. Middle 
Class: Middle Life is represented by the
 same disposition of the hands but with 
the middle fingers and the thumbs joined
. Middle Class: Upper Life shows also 
the same disposition of the hand, the an
-i-in being formed by the indexes (
forefingers) and the thumbs.
(2) Lower Class: Lower Life is 
represented by the right hand raised to 
shoulder level the left hand reposing on
 the left knee, palm upward. Each hand 
makes the an-i-in with the ring finger 
and the thumb. Lower Class: Middle Life 
shows the same disposition of the hands,
 while the an-i-in is formed by the 
middle fingers and the thumbs. The same 
disposition of the hands is indicated 
for Lower Class: Upper Life but here the
 an-i-in is formed by the indexes (
forefingers) and the thumbs. This mudra 
signifies the descent of Amida on the 
earth to seek the souls of the dead, and
 is one of the most frequently 
represented forms of Amida Buddha."

<xa>LOTUS</xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Saddharma Pundarika Sutra</_-xa>
<_-xa>Miracles</_-xa>; <_-xa>Parable</_-xa>

A major Buddhist text and one of the 
most widely read sutras in the present 
day. One of the earliest and most richly
 descriptive of the Mahayana sutras of 
Indian origin. It became important for 
the shaping of the Buddhist tradition in
 East Asia, in particular because of its
 teaching of the One Vehicle under which
 are subsumed the usual Theravada and 
Mahayana divisions. It is the main text 
of the Tendai (T'ien T'ai) school. 
Famous Quote
"The house of Buddha is compassion, the 
robe of Buddha is tolerance, and the 
seat of Buddha is the emptiness of all 
phenomena."
(I) Historical/Transcendent Buddha 
In the Lotus Sutra the Buddha is not 
presented as a historical person, but 
rather as a manifestation of the 
Dharmakaya, which exists eternally. 
Every being participates in this 
transcendental nature of the Buddha and 
can thus become a Buddha." 
<pb n="986"/>
The Sutra teaches the identification of 
the historical Buddha with the 
transcendental Buddha, his appearance in
 the phenomenal world being only a 
skillful device (upaya) adopted to 
preach the Dharma to mankind.
(II) Faith
"The Lotus Sutra stresses the importance
 of faith on the path to liberation, as 
a result of which the Buddhas and 
Bodhisattvas can offer their help. A 
separate chapter is devoted to the 
Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara in which the
 notion of help from the Bodhisattvas is
 clearly expressed. 
"The Lotus Sutra praises the wonderful 
assistance given to sentient beings in 
all kinds of distress by the Bodhisattva
 Avalokitesvara, who, in the Pure Land 
sutras, is one of the two principal 
assistants of Amitabha." 
"Salvation is attained by the grace of 
the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, the 
Theravada method of salvation being 
regarded as inadequate." 
(III) T'ien-t'ai and Pure Land 
This school has a historically close 
relationship with the Pure Land School. 
Thus, Master T'ai Hsu (q.v.) taught that
 the Lotus Sutra and the Amitabha Sutra 
<pb n="987"/>
were closely connected, differing only 
in length. 
'The Lotus Sutra is the Amitabha Sutra 
preached in detail, and the Amitabha 
Sutra is the Lotus Sutra in summary. In 
contrast to other sutras which expound 
many terms in connection with the nature
 and characteristics of things and 
persuade people to understand the 
principles and to work on self-
cultivation, these two sutras deal only 
with perception of phenomenal reality by
 the direct reasoning mind. 
In the Amitabha Sutra, Buddha said, 'If 
there is a good man or a good woman who 
hears someone speak of Buddha Amitabha 
and holds firmly His name and title for 
one day, or two days, or three days, or 
four days, or five days, or six days, or
 seven days, whole-heartedly and without
 distraction, when this person 
approaches the hour of death, Buddha 
Amitabha and his holy company will 
manifest themselves in front of him. 
This person, since he is not confused, 
will be reborn in the most blissful 
country of Buddha Amitabha.'.. To quote 
from the 23rd chapter of the lotus Sutra
, 'Anyone who hears this Sutra and 
practices accordingly, when his present 
<pb n="988"/>
life ends, will go to the Western 
Paradise.' The similarity of these two 
passages is apparent. Other descriptions
 in the Amitabha Sutra of the grandeur 
and splendor of the Land, of Buddha's 
life, of Buddha's radiance and of the 
protection and care by the Buddhas of 
the six directions, though different in 
comprehensiveness and language, are, in 
fact, identical in their content and 
significance. Therefore, one invocation 
of Buddha Amitabha's name represents the
 supreme Dharma and covers unlimited 
approaches." 



<xa>LOTUS</xa>
<_-xa>Ocean of Worlds</_-xa>

"The universe as purified by the vows 
and deeds of Vairocana Buddha, the 
cosmic aspect of Buddha Sakyamuni. By 
extension, the Lotus Treasury World 
represents our True Mind, or Buddha 
Nature, which encompasses the whole 
world, yet, like the lotus flower, is 
untouched by mud or defilements." (NSBTC
, p.247) 
Lotus Treasury World:
<pb n="989"/>
"(1) In the Avatamsaka Sutra, the pure 
land of Vairochana Buddha, which was 
created through the fulfillment of his 
Bodhisattva vows and practices. At the 
base of this world is a windy circle, 
above which is a perfumed sea. Blooming 
in this sea is a great lotus, and inside
 the lotus blossom is the Lotus Treasury
 World. It consists of 20 central worlds
 surrounded by 111 peripheral worlds. 
Each of these worlds is ornamented with 
treasures and inhabited by a Buddha and 
a great many living beings.
(2) A similar world described in the 
Brahma Net Sutra. The world in the 
Bralvna Net Sutra is the thousand-
petaled lotus. Each of ; the thousand 
petals is a world in itself, consisting 
of ten billion smaller worlds, each with
 a sun, a moon, a Mt. Sumeru and four 
continents. Vairochana Buddha sits in 
the center of the Lotus. In each of the 
thousand petals dwells a Shakyamuni 
Buddha who is regarded as a 
transformation of Vairochana Buddha."

; <_-xa>Surangama Sutra</_-xa>

The basic goal of Buddhist cultivation 
or practice is to keep the mind empty 
and still so that our innate wisdom can 
manifest itself (a Buddha is all wisdom 
at all times). Thus, Buddhism fosters 
practices and habits that subdue 
passions and simplify life, freeing the 
cultivator for spiritual pursuits. It is
 in this context that sexual desire, 
<pb n="991"/>
excessive rest and sleep, etc. are 
considered afflictions. 
Love is considered an affliction in 
Buddhism because, like all emotions, it 
disturbs the peacefulness of the mind-
particularly at the crucial time of 
death. 
Buddhism of Wisdom ＆ faith/ excerpts:
"Concerning the danger of love-
attachment at the time of death, as 
indicated earlier, the practitioner 
should think thus: family members, 
including parents, brothers, sisters, 
husbands, wives and children, are 
temporarily gathered together in this 
life as a result of previous causes and 
conditions, such as karmic debts or love
 and hatred, accumulated from time 
immemorial. When these causes and 
conditions come to an end, we all part 
and go our separate ways. If we truly 
care for them, we should endeavor to be 
reborn in the Pure Land, so as to be 
able to save everyone, friend and foe 
alike. Although we may have attachments 
to family and friends, when death 
approaches, there is nothing we can 
bring along or do, as even our very body
 disintegrates and returns to dust. If 
we harbor thoughts of attachment and 
<pb n="992"/>
love, not only will we fail to achieve 
rebirth in the Pure Land, we will not 
escape the endless cycle of Birth and 
Death. The practitioner should ponder 
and clearly recall the 'Three Doubts and
 Four Narrow Passes' (q.v) to prepare 
himself. His mind will then be calm and 
undisturbed at the time of death." 
NOTES 
i. According to Buddhist teachings, if 
there were another obstruction or force 
as strong as love-attachment, no 
cultivator could ever hope to attain 
Enlightenment and Buddhahood:
"The Buddha said: ... There is nothing 
greater than love and desire. 
Fortunately, it is one of a kind. If 
there were something else like it, no 
one in the entire world would be able to
 cultivate the Way." (Sutra in Forty-Two
 Sections, Master Hsuan Hua, tr.)
ii. "The Buddha frequently cautioned 
monks to be on their guard when dealing 
with women lest they be overcome by lust
 and craving. The following interchange,
 taken from the Maha-Parinibbana Sutra, 
between the Buddha and Ananda, his 
attendant, may be taken as typical in 
this respect. 
'-Lord, how should we conduct ourselves 
<pb n="993"/>
with regard to women?
-Don't see them, Ananda.
-But if we should see them?
-Don't talk to them.
-But if they should talk to us?
-Keep wide awake, Ananda."'

." 
Background
"In the centuries that followed the 
Buddha's death, various attempts were 
made to organize and formulate his 
teachings. Different systems appeared, 
basing themselves on the recorded 
<pb n="999"/>
scriptures, each purporting to express 
the Buddha's intended meaning. Four, or 
rather three, great syntheses emerged: 
that of the Vaibhashika and Sautrantika 
(which for practical purposes may be 
taken together), that of the Madhyamika,
 and that of the Vijnanavada (also 
referred to as Yogachara, the 'mind-only
' school). That there should be a 
multiplicity of systems is not in itself
 surprising. From the time of his 
enlightenment until his death fifty 
years later, the Buddha bestowed his 
teachings for the benefit of many 
different audiences. The purpose of his 
doctrine was always the same: to 
liberate beings from the round of 
suffering. The expression of this 
purpose, however, differed according to 
the capacity of his hearers. It is 
therefore to be expected that the body 
of teachings remaining after his 
departure from the world should be rich 
and varied, containing elements that 
sometimes even contradict each other. 
The Madhyamika deals with this state of 
affairs by saying that statements made 
by the Buddha are of two kinds: absolute
 (nitartha), corresponding to his true 
meaning, as understood by himself, and 
<pb n="1000"/>
expedient (neyartha), corresponding to a
<pb n="1"/>
<article>《英漢-漢英-英英佛學辭典》中華佛典寶庫 編</article>
 partial expression of his meaning, 
geared to the understanding of his 
hearers, intended to lead them along the
 path to perfect comprehension and being
 therefore of provisional validity. 
Parallel with this division is the 
doctrine of the two truths: absolute 
truth (paramartha) corresponding to 
reality, and relative truth (samvriti) 
corresponding to empirical experience. 
According to Nagarjuna, the Buddha 
skillfully graduated his teaching 
according to pedagogical necessity. He 
affirmed the existence of the atman, the
 self, as against the 'nihilist' (who 
disbelieves in survival after death), in
 order to maintain the truth of karma 
and ethical responsibility. By contrast,
 he denied the existence of the atman, 
as against the 'eternalist' (who takes 
the self to be a changeless essence). He
 also said that there is neither self 
nor no-self."

"Buddhist society founded in Sri Lanka 
in 1891 by Ceylonese monk, the Venerable
<pb n="3"/>
 Anagarika Dharmapala. The primary aims
of the Mahabodhi Society were, first, 
restoration of the Maha Bodhi temple at 
Buddha-Gaya, in North India (scene of 
the Buddha's enlightenment); second, the
 revival of the BuddhaDharma in the land
 of its birth. At that time, Buddha-Gaya
 (or Bodh-Gaya) was in the province of 
Bengal, then part of British-ruled India
. The temple was the property of a 
landowner, and was in seriously 
neglected condition. The Mahabodhi 
Society called a conference at Bodh-Gaya
 in October 1891 to enlist support of 
Buddhists in various other countries; in
 the following year publication of the 
journals The Maha Bodhi and The United 
Buddhist World began, which from then on
 played a not unimportant part in 
winning sympathy and support from 
English-speaking people in India and 
elsewhere. Opposition from both Hindu 
landowners and British authorities, 
however, was such that a lengthy process
 of legal action became necessary, which
 ended only with India's independence 
from British rule and the passing by the
 new Government of Bihar of the Buddha-
Gaya Temple Act in 1949, under terms of 
which a temple management committee, (
<pb n="4"/>
consisting of 4 Buddhist and 4 Hindu 
members (with the District Magistrate of
 Gaya, a Hindu, as ex-officio chairman))
, was entrusted with the care and 
control of the temple. By this time the 
Mahabodhi Society had gained 
considerable support in India and 
elsewhere. Its journal published in 
English, The Maha Bodhi, circulates 
throughout the world."

New Development
A movement to free the Temple Management
 Committee from non-Buddhist influence 
by amending the Buddha-Gaya Temple Act 
has been gathering momentum for a number
 of years. It appears to have achieved a
 modicum of success recently under the 
leadership of an Indian monk of Japanese
 descent who received his religious 
training in Thailand. The aim is to have
 temple affairs invested mainly in 
Buddhist hands, albeit for the benefit 
of Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike.

after the Council of Pataliputra in 350 
BCE. According to tradition, the

and it may be regarded as the forerunner

centuries. The Mahasamghikas 
distinguished themselves from the 
Sthaviras doctrinally in their

Surangama Sutra:
"Mahasthama, a son of the (Buddha), was 
the head of a group of fifty-two 
Bodhisattvas, rose from his seat, 
prostrated himself with his head at the 
feet of the Buddha and declared: 'I 
still remember that in the remotest of 
aeons countless as the sands in the 
Ganges, there was a "Buddha called 
Amitabha who was succeeded by eleven 
other Tathagatas in that kalpa. The last
 one was called the Buddha Whose Light 
Surpassed that of the Sun and Moon"; he 
<pb n="10"/>
taught me how to realize the state of 
Samadhi by thinking exclusively of 
Amitabha Buddha. By way of illustration,
 if a man concentrates his mind on 
someone else while the latter always 
forgets him, both may meet and see, but 
without recognizing, each other. However
, if both are keen on thinking of each 
other, their keenness will grow from one
 incarnation to another until they 
become inseparable like a body and its 
shadow. The Tathagatas in the Ten 
Directions have compassion for all 
living beings and always think of them, 
like a mother who never ceases thinking 
of her son. If the son runs away, her 
thoughts of him will not help. But if he
 also thinks of her with the same 
keenness, they will not be separated in 
spite of the passing of transmigrations.
 If a living being remembers and thinks 
of the Buddha, he is bound to behold Him
 in his present or future incarnation. 
He will not be far from the Buddha and 
thus without the aid of any other 
expedient, his mind will be opened. He 
is like a man whose body, perfumed by 
incense, gives out fragrance; hence his 
name "One Glorified by (Buddha's) 
Fragrance and Light." From my

 thoughts concentrated on the Buddha, I 
achieved the patient endurance of the 
uncreate (Tolerance of Non-Birth, q.v.).
(This is why) I help all living beings 
of this world to control their thoughts 
by repeating the Buddha's name so that 
they can reach the Pure Land. As Buddha 
now asks about the best means of 
perfection, I hold that nothing can 
surpass the perfect control of the six 
senses with continuous pure thoughts (of
 Amitabha) in order to realize Samadhi.'

<xa>MAHAVASTU</xa>
"Mahayana scripture relating the 
legendary life of the Buddha." 



<xa>MAHAYANA</xa>
<_-xa>Mahayana / Theravada</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Mahayana (A Parable)</_-xa>

Mahayana is one of the two main 
traditions of Buddhism, the other being 
Theravada (Tantric Buddhism or Vajrayana
<pb n="12"/>
 is a branch of Mahayana). 
"The Mahayana branch of Buddhism 
expounds Bodhisattva practice as the 
means towards enlightenment of both 
oneself and others, in contrast to 
Theravada Buddhism, or the teaching of 
the Agama period." 
(I) Main Characteristics
"Three main tendencies can be identified
: the full adoption of a heroic ideal, a
 new cosmology closely related to 
visualization practices and a new 
philosophical orientation based upon the
 experience of 'emptiness'...(i) The 
heroic ideal of the Bodhisattva path was
 not new. What was new was the claim, 
explicit or implicit, that this should 
be adopted by all. Immediate personal 
enlightenment (Arhatship) was now to be 
seen as an inferior goal. Greater stress
 was laid on altruistic action based 
upon 'skill in means' and compassion. 
This too was not new, but was now 
emphasized more than ever before. (ii) 
The background world picture of early 
Buddhism was that of an Indian religion 
in general but modified to fit the 
Buddhist meditational 'map'. Meditation 
practices included recollection of the 
qualities of the Buddha (Buddha 
<pb n="13"/>
Recitation) and various kinds of 
visualization exercises. The Mahayana 
took these earlier cosmological and 
meditational elements and combined them.
 The result was much more specifically 
Buddhist in form. Such earlier Indian 
deities as Brahma and Indra were 
overshadowed by new figures -Buddhas and
 advanced Bodhisattvas. Their names and 
much of their nature derive from earlier
 devotional responses to the Buddha. 
They could and did become much more 
closely associated with the most 
spiritual and uniquely Buddhist 
teachings. (iii) The philosophy of 
emptiness developed from earlier '
insight meditation' and the related 
Abhidhamma thought. The aim of both is 
to dissolve rigid views (ditthi) and 
bring about a fresher perception of the 
world. Apparent entities such as the 
mind are merely changing collections of 
evanescent events." 
(II) Background
"After Shakyamuni's death, the Buddhist 
Order experienced several schisms, and 
eventually eighteen or twenty schools 
formed, each of which developed its own 
doctrinal interpretation of the sutras. 
As time passed, the monks of these 
<pb n="14"/>
schools tended to withdraw more and more
 from the lay community and sequester 
themselves in their monasteries, where 
they devoted themselves to the practice 
of doctrinal exegeses. Around the end of
 the first century B.C. (i.e., the 
beginning of the Common Era), a new 
group of Buddhists emerged who were 
dissatisfied with what they saw as the 
self-complacency and monastic elitism of
 the earlier schools and who aimed at 
the salvation of all people. They called
 their Buddhism Mahayana (great vehicle)
, meaning the teaching which can lead 
all people to enlightenment. They 
criticized the earlier, traditional 
schools for seeking only personal 
enlightenment, contemptuously calling 
them the Lesser Vehicle. Mahayana seems 
to have arisen at least in part as a 
reform movement, seeking to restore the 
original spirit of Buddhism, and has 
involved lay believers as well as clergy
. Where Theravada teaches the 
elimination of earthly desires, Mahayana
 takes a more positive view of earthly 
desires and aims at redirecting them."

<xa>MAHAYANA</xa>
<_-xa>Mahayana Buddhism</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Theravada Buddhism</_-xa>; <_-xa>Mahayana/
Theravada (parable)</_-xa>
(I) Different Emphasis
"There are two main forms of Buddhism. 
The Theravada tradition-- meaning the 
Teachings of the Elders -adheres to a 
strict understanding of the teachings of
 the historical Buddha. It teaches 
personal individual struggle to find the
 Path to enlightenment. This is hard, 
not often achieved and always takes 
years and many lives, to achieve. The 
other form of Buddhism is called 
Mahayana, the Great Vehicle tradition. 
This tradition holds that the 
individualism and difficulty of the 
Theravada tradition are unnecessary. It 
presents a vision of the Buddha and of 
Buddhism which is accessible to all, 
religious and lay person alike. It 
offers the possibility of release from 
the cycle of suffering and death and 
rebirth. This comes through personal 
devotion and reliance upon the 
salvationary activities of various 
intermediaries known as Bodhisattvas. 
Through countless lives of perfection, 
<pb n="16"/>
Bodhisattvas have acquired great merit 
which they use to free those who suffer.
 Mahayana Buddhism is called the Great 
Vehicle because its teachings are like a
 vast wagon capable of carrying many to 
release from rebirth." 
"The devaluation of the empirical world 
as illusory is also of consequence for 
the devotional Ways of the Mahayana ... 
Rebirth determined by deeds -- in 
Theravada regarded as an iron law of 
nature -- softens in Mahayana and this 
makes it possible to assume that 
Bodhisattvas and Buddhas can give the 
liberation-seeker assistance from 
outside. The recognition of such 
transcendent beings is the most obvious 
characteristic which distinguishes 
between Mahayana and Theravada."

(III) Parable:
"As the Theravada and the Mahayana are 
both stages in the development of 
Buddhism, both are addressed to all 
individuals, so we can't distinguish 
between them in this respect. At the 
same time, there is a difference, which 
will perhaps become clear with the help 
of a parable. Let's suppose that there 
is famine somewhere, a terrible famine 
of the kind that still happens in Africa
. People are gaunt and emaciated, and 
there is terrible suffering. In a 
certain town in the country which has 
been struck by this famine there live 
two men, one old, one young who each 
have an enormous quantity of grain, 
easily enough to feed all the people. 
The old man puts outside his front door 
<pb n="18"/>
a notice which reads: 'Whoever comes 
will be given food.' But after that 
statement there follows a long list of 
conditions and rules. If people want 
food they must come at a certain time, 
on the very minute. They must bring with
 them receptacles of a certain shape and
 size. And holding these receptacles in 
a certain way, they must ask the old man
 for food in certain set phrases which 
are to be spoken in an archaic language.
 Not many people see the notice, for the
 old man lives in an out-of-the-way 
street; and of those who do see it, a 
few come for food and receive it, but 
others are put off by the long list of 
rules... When the old man is asked why 
he imposes so many rules, he says 'That'
s how it was in my grandfather's time 
whenever there was a famine. What was 
good enough for him is certainly good 
enough for me. Who am I to change things
?' He adds that if people really want 
food they will observe any number of 
rules to get it. If they won't observe 
the rules they can't really be hungry. 
Meanwhile the young man takes a great 
sack of grain on his back and goes from 
door to door giving it out. As soon as 
one sack is empty, he rushes home for 
<pb n="19"/>
another one. In this way he gives out a 
great deal of grain all over the town. 
He gives it to anyone who asks. He's so 
keen to feed the people that he doesn't 
mind going into the poorest, darkest and
 dirtiest of hovels. He doesn't mind 
going to places where respectable people
 don't usually venture. The only thought
 in his head is that nobody should be 
allowed to starve. Some people say that 
he's a busybody, others that he takes 
too much on himself. Some people go so 
far as to say that he's interfering with
 the law of karma. Others complain that 
a lot of grain is being wasted, because 
people take more than they really need. 
The young man doesn't care about any of 
this. He says it's better that some 
grain is wasted than that anyone should 
starve to death. One day the young man 
happens to pass by the old man's house. 
The old man is sitting outside 
peacefully smoking his pipe, because it 
isn't yet time to hand out grain. He 
says to the young man as he hurries past
, 'You look tired. Why don't you take it
 easy?' The young man replies, rather 
breathlessly, 'I can't. There are still 
lots of people who haven't been fed.' 
The old man shakes his head wonderingly.
<pb n="20"/>
 'Let them come to you! why should you 
go dashing off to them?' But the young 
man, impatient to be on his way, says '
They're too weak to come to me. They can
't even walk. If I don't go to them they
'll die.' 'That's too bad,' says the old
 man. 'They should have come earlier, 
when they were stronger. If they didn't 
think ahead that's their fault. 'But by 
this time the young man is out of 
earshot, already on his way home for 
another sack. The old man rises and pins
 another notice beside the first one. 
The notice reads: 'Rules for reading the
 rules.' 
No doubt you've already guessed the 
meaning of the parable. The old man is 
the Arhat, representing Southern 
Buddhism, and the young man is the 
Bodhisattva, representing the Mahayana. 
The famine is the human predicament, the
 people of the town are all living 
beings, and the grain is the Dharma, the
 teaching. Just as in principle both the
 old and the young man are willing to 
give out grain to everybody, so in 
principle both the Theravada and the 
Mahayana are universal, meant for all. 
But in practice we find that the 
Theravada imposes certain conditions. To
<pb n="21"/>
 practice Buddhism within the Theravada 
tradition, even today, if you're taking 
it all seriously, you must leave home 
and become a monk or nun. You must live 
exactly as the monks and nuns lived in 
India in the Buddha's time. And you 
mustn't change anything. The Mahayana 
doesn't impose any such conditions. It 
makes the Dharma available to people as 
they are and where they are, because it 
is concerned solely with essentials. It'
s concerned with getting the grain to 
the people, not with any particular 
manner in which this is to be done. The 
Theravada expects people to come to it, 
so to speak, but the Mahayana goes out 
to them. This difference between the 
Theravada and the Mahayana goes back to 
the early days of Buddhist history. 
About a hundred years after the Buddha's
 death, his disciples disagreed about 
certain issues so strongly that the 
spiritual community was split in two. 
Indeed, they disagreed about the very 
nature of Buddhism itself. One group of 
disciples held that Buddhism was simply 
what the Buddha had said. The Four Noble
 Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, the 
Twelve Links or chain of conditioned co-
production, the Four Foundations of 
<pb n="22"/>
Mindfulness -- this was Buddhism. But 
the other group responded that this was 
not enough. Yes, all of these teachings 
did form part of Buddhism, but the 
example of the Buddha's life could not 
be ignored. The Buddha's teaching 
revealed his wisdom, bat his life 
revealed his compassion, and both 
together made up Buddhism." 
NB: The differences between the two 
branches of Buddhism, Mahayana and 
Theravada, are deliberately emphasized 
in the above passages for the sake of 
clarity. In actual practice, these 
differences are less clear-cut, and 
depend mainly on the state of mind of 
the individual practitioner rather than 
on his affiliation. 
(IV) Notes 
Unlike Mahayana schools, the Theravada 
tradition makes no mention of Amitabha 
Buddha, the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, 
etc. or the Pure Land. Theravadins 
believe mainly in Sakyamuni Buddha and 
the Bodhisattva Maitreya, but not in the
 numerous transhistorical Buddhas and 
Bodhisattvas of the Mahayana tradition. 
This is because Theravada stresses the 
historical Buddha and His early 
teachings, applying the term Bodhisattva
<pb n="23"/>
 mainly to the previous incarnations of 
Buddha Sakyamuni. 
The various teachings of the Buddha 
constitute a totality. While it is said 
that the Buddha taught 84,000 methods in
 accordance with the capacity of his 
listeners, on another level we can also 
say that individuals receive and 
understand these teachings differently. 
It is like rain which falls equally on 
all vegetation. However, the big trees 
absorb more of the rain water than the 
smaller trees, while a dead bush cannot 
benefit at all. The differences between 
the different Buddhist schools are 
similar: they are caused by the 
different capacities of Buddhist 
followers and not by the Buddha 
preaching different teachings to 
different audiences. (See the Lotus 
Sutra).

Buddhist cosmos. May also depict the 
abodes of deities in Paradise and in

Jpn/Monju; Vn/Nan-Thu-Su-Loi.
"Manjusri, who embodies the wisdom of 
all Buddhas, is sometimes shown as being
 of more benefit to sentient beings than
 is the Buddha. The reason for this 
seeming overstatement is to stress the 
fact that only the transcendental wisdom
 of Prajnaparamita, which Manjusri 
embodies, can conquer demons, and not 
magical formulas, spells, or other 
thaumaturgical techniques."

"The Buddha once said, I owe it to 
Manjusri (i.e., transcendental wisdom) 
that I now become a Buddha. Innumerable 
Buddhas in the past had been Manjusri's 
disciples, and those who will become 
Buddhas in the future also owe their 
enlightenment to his awesome power. Just
<pb n="31"/>
 as children in the world have their own
 parents, so Manjusri assumes parenthood
 on the Buddha-path."' 
Manjusri is portrayed in Buddhist art 
with the sword of wisdom in one hand and
 a book (scroll) in the other. He 
embodies wisdom at the Buddha/
Bodhisattva level, as opposed to 
Sariputra, the embodiment of the wisdom 
of the Arhats. 



<xa>MANTRA</xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Dharani</_-xa>
<_-xa>Paritta護身咒</_-xa>; <_-xa>Mudra</_-xa>

"Incantation, mental command, mnemonic 
spell, concentration formula. Sanskrit 
word meaning 'uniting and holding,' that
 is, uniting all dharmas and holding all
 meanings." 
"A formula said to protect one who 
recites it and to benefit him by virtue 
of its mystic power. The word literally 
means to preserve and uphold the Buddha'
s teachings in one's heart. Dharanis are
 recited in Sanskrit and sometimes have 
no literal meaning. They are especially 
valued in esoteric Buddhism." 
<pb n="32"/>
"The practice is based on the scientific
 knowledge of the occult power of sound.
 The most famous Mantra is 'On Mani 
Padme Hum."' 
"A Dharani is usually longer than a 
Mantra, which can even consist of one 
word." 

SPIRITUAL POWERS
"Reciting mantras and sutras for the 
purpose of sowing merits and wisdom and 
eliminating evil karma and 
transgressions is all to the good. 
However, to be deluded and seek 
spiritual powers is to abandon the roots
 for the branches -- an error in 
judgement. If, furthermore, your mind is
 grasping, your understanding of the 
Dharma nebulous, your precept-keeping 
lax, your Bodhi Mind undeveloped and 
your discriminatory, win-lose mind 
raging unchecked, you will be exposed 
one day to demons that may drive you 
insane! If you want to obtain spiritual 
powers, you should first attain 
Enlightenment and Buddhahood. Once 
Buddhahood is attained, you will 
naturally have full spiritual powers. If
 you do not strive for the Way but 
merely seek spiritual powers, let us not
<pb n="33"/>
 even speak about whether anything can 
be gained. If you should obtain anything
, it would become an impediment to the 
Way. For this reason, the Buddhas and 
Patriarchs have strictly prohibited this
 erroneous form of cultivation (i.e. 
seeking spiritual powers)." 

Pure Land Buddhism
"In Pure Land, reciting mantras should 
be considered an ancillary practice, 
rather than a principal method along 
with Buddha Recitation. The merits 
derived from mantra recitation are 
indeed inconceivable. However, ordinary 
people who achieve rebirth in the Pure 
Land owe it entirely to utterly sincere 
Faith and Vows, as these correspond to 
the lofty Vows of Amitabha Buddha. If 
you are not clear about this truth, 
thinking that all Dharmas are 
unfathomable and therefore it does not 
matter which method you cultivate, you 
will end up practicing neither the 
Esoteric nor Pure Land teachings. This 
will lead to eons of wandering in the 
wasteland of Birth and Death -- whom, 
then, could you rely on for help?" 

Question/Answer
<pb n="34"/>
"As for Hsu Chun, he has said that '
according to the Tantric method, 
wherever the power of mantras goes, be 
it on a wisp of air or a grain of dust, 
sentient beings there will all be 
liberated. Does the Pure Land method 
bring such benefits?' 
Answer: You should know that while 
reciting mantras brings limitless 
blessings and virtue; reciting the 
Buddha's name also has unimaginable 
power! Do you not recall this passage 
from the Meditation Sutra: Even those 
who have committed the Five Grave 
Offenses or the Ten Evil Acts, may, on 
the verge of death, when the marks of 
the hells appear, recite the Buddha's 
name with utmost faith and sincerity (i.
e. singlemindedly) a few times, and be 
reborn immediately in the Pure Land."

<xa>MARRIAGE</xa>
<_-xa>Meiji Restoration</_-xa>; <_-xa>Birth
 and Death</_-xa>; <_-xa>Overeating</_-xa>
(I) Laymen
"The Buddhist views on marriage are very
 liberal: in Buddhism, marriage is 
<pb n="37"/>
regarded entirely as a personal and 
individual concern, and not as a 
religious duty. There are no religious 
laws in Buddhism compelling a lay person
 to be married, to remain as a bachelor 
or lead a life of total chastity. It is 
not laid down anywhere that Buddhists 
must produce children or regulate the 
number of children that they produce. 
Buddhism allows each individual the 
freedom to decide for himself all the 
issues pertaining to marriage. 
"In Hindu tradition, the main duties 
assigned to women were childbearing and 
housework. Consequently, a single life 
was seen as a wasted life and unmarried 
women were subject to scoffs. On the 
contrary, in Buddhism, married life has 
always been viewed as a hindrance to 
spiritual pursuits. Wherever the 
Buddhist point of view prevailed, a 
woman was no longer compelled to marry 
to achieve self-respect and approval 
from her family. Once the order of nuns 
was established, it provided an even 
better option for women who were 
spiritually and religiously inclined. 
Sumana, the youngest daughter of 
Anathapindika remained single and joined
 the Buddhist Order at an advanced age. 
<pb n="38"/>
There are other instances recorded in 
the Therigatha." 
(II)Clergy
Celibacy of monks and nuns is 
traditionally a strict requirement in 
all schools of Buddhism. The only 
exception appears to be the Japanese 
clergy, particularly after the Meiji 
restoration (l9th century). Tibetan 
Lamas, who are not necessarily monks, 
can be either celibate or married. The 
single most important reason for monks 
and nuns to be celibate is to break all 
attachments and ultimately the cycle of 
Birth and Death. 
"Although Japanese monks often marry and
 have children, the tradition of 
celibacy is maintained among the nuns." 

Surangama Sutra:
"You should teach worldly men who 
practice Samadhi to cut off their 
lustful minds at the very start. This is
 called the Buddha's profound teaching 
of the first decisive deed. Therefore, 
Ananda, if carnality is not wiped out, 
the practice of dhyana (meditation) is 
like cooking gravel to make rice; even 
if it is boiled for hundreds and 
thousands of eons, it will be only 
<pb n="39"/>
gravel. Why? Because instead of rice 
grains it contains only stones... You 
should cut off both sensual body and 
mind until even the very thought of 
doing so ceases; only then can you hope 
to seek the Buddha's Enlightenment. This
 teaching of mine is that of the Buddhas
 whereas any other is that of evil 
demons."

<xa>MATERIALISM</xa>
<_-xa>Buddhism</_-xa>
<pb n="40"/>

"The Buddha appears to have made a 
conscious attempt to avoid the dogmatism
 of competing religious systems. He 
aimed to teach only what was essential 
for spiritual development and carefully 
excluded from his system everything not 
directly relevant to that purpose. The 
result is radically unusual. The Buddha 
set out a middle way, based mainly upon 
pragmatic considerations. One-sided 
viewpoints and aims were rejected. 
Materialistic views of life and 
spiritually oriented beliefs in personal
 immortality were considered equally 
misleading. Mistaken too were extreme 
goals, seeking either self-satisfaction 
through indulgence in pleasure or self-
purification through ascetic discipline.
 Traditional religious beliefs, rites 
and customs were re-evaluated, not so 
much on the basis of 'reason' as of what
 might be called 'spiritual common sense
'. Extreme forms of superstition and 
ritualism were opposed, but so was a 
naive materialism which sought to deny 
the real experiences of the spiritual 
path."

childhood. Together with Shariputra, 
Maudgalyayana was at first a disciple of
 Sanjaya Belatthiputta, one of six 
famous non-Buddhist teachers. Later the 
two became followers of Shakyamuni and 
entered the Buddhist Order, taking all 
of Sanjaya's 250 disciples with them. 
Maudgalyayana died before Shakyamuni, 
killed by a hostile Brahman while on an 
alms round in Rajagriha."

"Buddha who heals the ills of body and 
spirit including that of ignorance; 
<pb n="43"/>
popular figure in early Mahayana 
Buddhism; reigns over the Pure Lapis 
Lazuli Paradise in the East." 
"Iconographically, he is usually 
depicted with a healing fruit in his 
right hand and his left in the gesture 
of protecting or resting in his lap. He 
often appears as part of a triad with 
Shakyamuni and Amitabha, in which he is 
on the left, and Amitabha on the right.
In a sutra dedicated to him, only extant
 in Tibetan and Chinese, twelve vows are
 mentioned that Bhaishajya-guru (
Medicine Buddha or Healing Buddha) made 
in a previous life and in the 
fulfillment of which he is aided by a 
great number of helpers, including 
Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and the yaksas (q
.v.). He is of great importance in 
Mahayana countries, particularly China, 
Tibet, Vietnam, and Japan."

Background
"Exponents of Tibetan tantric practice 
and of the Chinese/Japanese forms of 
Pure Land practices will recognize close
 affinities between what they have 
learned and what is advocated in the 
Healing Buddha sutras. Those familiar 
with works about Kuan Yin (
<pb n="44"/>
Avalokitesvara/ Chenrezig) will find 
that the powers attributed to the 
Healing Buddha, and the reasons for 
those powers, are very similar in 
character to those attributed to that 
Bodhisattva. People who wrongly suppose 
that Pure Land Buddhism represents a 
turning away from the methods and values
 cherished by other schools such as Ch'
an (Zen) will discover that this is far 
from being the case, since it can be 
confidently asserted that similar 
methods and values pertaining to the 
Healing Buddha are accepted by the vast 
majority of Mahayana Buddhists, no 
matter to which school they belong." (

Healing Buddha, p. x)

"Meditation is one of the 3 major 
components of the Buddhist way, the 
<pb n="45"/>
other two being morality, (or precept-
keeping which precedes and must always 
accompany the activity of meditation), 
and wisdom, which is reached as a result
 of meditation. The Western reader is 
liable to misunderstand what the 
Buddhist means by meditation, and to 
imagine that it implies a 'relaxed' or '
inactive' state. But in the Buddhist 
view, meditation is an activity in which
 one is engaged in subduing discursive 
thought, destroying or discouraging 
unwholesome mental states, and 
initiating or nourishing wholesome 
mental states. It is a discipline that 
has to be learned from a master. Without
 such personal supervision, it cannot be
 properly undertaken. Herein is one of 
the principal reasons for the existence 
of the Buddhist monastery; it is a 
school of meditation, where younger 
monks learn from older, more advanced 
monks." 
"There are two basic kinds of meditative
 practice. The first is the development 
of concentration, where we give the mind
 a single object and rest there (Samatha
). The second kind is the development of
 mindful awareness, in which we use the 
tranquility that arises from 
<pb n="46"/>
concentration in order to see the 
impermanent, changing nature of all our 
experience (Vipasyana)." 
Cultivators should exercise wisdom in 
receiving the teachings, carefully 
distinguishing the true from the false 
and the deviant.
<_-xa>the following passage by the late 
founder of the Buddhist Lodge and 
Buddhist Society (London), on the true 
goal of all Buddhist practice: "In the 
West, the need for some guidance in mind
-development was made acute ... by a 
sudden spate of books which were, 
whatever the motive of their authors, 
dangerous in the extreme. No word was 
said in them of the sole right motive 
for mind-development, the enlightenment 
of the meditator for the benefit of all 
mankind, and the reader was led to 
believe that it was quite legitimate to 
study and practice mindfulness, and the 
higher stages which ensue, for the 
benefit of business efficiency and the 
advancement of personal prestige. In 
these circumstances, Concentration and 
Meditation ... was compiled and 
published by the (British) Buddhist 
Society, with constant stress on the 
importance of right motive, and ample 
<pb n="47"/>
warning of the dangers, from a headache 
to insanity, which lie in wait for those
 who trifle with the greatest force on 
earth, the human mind." (Christmas ' 
Humphreys, The Buddhist Way of Life, p. 
100.) </_-xa>
"We could use a parable to describe the 
process of teaching meditation. When 
people first come along to learn to 
meditate, they quite often ask 'What is 
the goal of meditation?' You wouldn't 
usually reply, straight off, 'Well, the 
goal of meditation is to become like a 
Buddha' because that's the last thing 
most people want to be. They're not 
interested in anything religious or 
spiritual; they just want peace of mind 
in the midst of their everyday life and 
work. And it's perfectly true to say 
that meditation gives you peace of mind.
 But when they've been through 
meditation, then they might ask 'Well, 
is this all, or is there something more 
to meditation?' That would be the right 
time to say 'Yes, there is something 
more. Peace of mind in the ordinary 
psychological sense is not the final 
goal of meditation, but only an 
intermediate stage. Beyond it there's a 
spiritual goal-- Supreme Enlightenment 
<pb n="48"/>
or Buddhahood.' Here 'peace of mind' is 
the magic city in which the traveller is
 nourished and allowed to rest for the 
long journey to Enlightenment." 
Caveat: 
Surangama Sutra: "You should teach 
worldly men who practice Samadhi to cut 
off their lustful minds at the very 
start. This is called the Buddha's 
profound teaching of the first decisive 
deed. Therefore, Ananda, if carnality is
 not wiped out, the practice of dhyana (

be only gravel. Why? Because instead of

doing so ceases; only then can you hope 
to seek the Buddha's Enlightenment. This
 teaching of mine is that of the Buddhas
 whereas any other is that of evil

NOTES 
i. "(Professor Robert Thurman of 
Columbia University in New York City) is
 only slightly less disdainful of 
Vipassana seminars that de-emphasize the
 supernatural side of the faith for the 
<pb n="49"/>
mechanics of meditation, or who, as 
Thurman puts it, 'teach lay-people to 
rationalize their own departures from 
the traditional view. I did so for 15 
years myself.' For Thurman, 'Euro-
American Buddhism doesn't exist yet, '
nor can it do so until it can furnish 
the true motors of devotion and keepers 
of the flame, 'ordained monks and nuns, 
supported in vows of celibacy and 
poverty, divorced from everyday life and
 supported by a community of lay members
."' Time Magazine: Oct 13,1997
ii. Most ancient masters, including such
 figures as the Patriarch Dogen, the 
founder of the Japanese school of Soto 
Zen, held that only those who could 
devote their full efforts to cultivation
 (monks and nuns) could achieve 
Enlightenment through meditation. To 
practice sporadically, during week-ends,
 for example, is helpful but cannot lead
 to enlightenment in one lifetime. The 
sutras compare such practitioners to 
those who rub two pieces of wood 
together but stop to rest before a fire 
is lit. (For details, see, for example,

Three Pure Land Sutras</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Vaidehi</_-xa>; <_-xa>Visualizations</_-xa>

One of the three core sutras of the Pure
 Land school. This sutra stresses the 
element of meditation/visualization in 
<pb n="52"/>
Pure Land. 
"The teachings of the Sixteen 
Meditations (q.v.) or contemplations and
 the nine possible degrees of rebirth (
Lotus Grades/ q.v.) are found in this 
sutra. This sutra no longer exists in 
Sanskrit." 
"The Meditation Sutra takes the doctrine
 of salvation through Amitabha (or 
Amitayus) much further (than the 
Amitabha Sutra).. Its special teaching 
is contained in a series of sixteen 
meditations. These are various kinds of 
visualisations which are elaborated at 
great length. The last three meditations
 are to help the devotee to perceive the
 (nine) grades to Buddhahood into which 
beings are born in Sukhavati (the Pure 
Land). Even those guilty of the most 
heinous sins will be born there, though 
in the lowest grade, if they would 
singlemindedly and with utter faith and 
sincerity recite ... ten times before 
death the name of Amitabha Buddha. It 
must be mentioned, however, that earlier
 in the sutra those who wish to practice
 these meditations are told that they 
should cultivate a threefold goodness. 
Firstly, they should support their 
parents; serve and respect their 
<pb n="53"/>
teachers and elders; be of compassionate
 mind, abstaining from doing any injury 
and perform the ten virtuous actions. 
Secondly, they should take refuge in the
 Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha, 
fulfill all moral precepts and not lower
 their dignity or neglect any ceremonial
 observance. Thirdly, they should give 
their whole mind to the attainment of 
enlightenment, deeply believe in the law
 of cause and effect, study and recite 
the Mahayana doctrine and encourage 
others to do the same. Paradoxically 
enough, it was the school of the 
Madhyamikas (an advocate of the 
supremacy of wisdom) which is also 
historically associated with upholding 
the supremacy of simple faith in a whole
-hearted devotion to the person of the 
Buddha. Nagarjuna, the founder of the 
Madhyamika school, recognised, in the 
Dasabhumika Sutra, two paths to Nirvana,
 the difficult one of personal effort 
and self-reliance and the easier one of 
dependence on the compassion of the 
Tathagatas. The easier path was further 
described as simply being the worship of
 the Buddhas, Amitabha and Maitreya. 
Vasubandhu, in his commentary on 
Nagarjuna's work, proposed another 
<pb n="54"/>
division -- which was later also adopted
 by Tao-ch'o of China (c. 645) -- that 
is the way of self-power and the way of 
another's power." (Encyclopedia of 
Buddhism, V. I: p.436)
(I) Background
"The Meditation Sutra begins with a 
prologue to the story of King Ajatasatru
 and his parents, former King Bimbisara 
and Lady Vaidehi. Upon (ascending the 
throne) Ajatasatru imprisoned Bimbisara 
with the intent to starve him to death. 
The Queen mother, Lady Vaidehi, however,
 succeeded in keeping Bimbisara alive by
 secretly feeding him during her visits.
 When Ajatasatru discovers this, he 
imprisoned her also out of extreme anger
. Deeply distressed by her son's actions
 and her own circumstances, Vaidehi 
turned to Sakyamuni Buddha for 
instruction on gaining rebirth in 
another realm without any suffering. The
 Buddha then through his transcendental 
powers illuminated the countless realms 
in the ten quarters of the universe. 
Vaidehi selected Amitabha's Sukhavati as
 the realm of her choice. 
The Buddha proceeded to expound the 
required practices for aspirants' 
rebirth. They include the 'Three 
<pb n="55"/>
Purified Acts" that are ethical in 
nature, to wit, the caring for one's 
parents and teachers, the adherence to 
precepts, and the reciting of the 
Mahayana sutras. The Buddha then led 
Vaidehi and others to see Amitabha's 
realm and, in that process, to attain 
the Insight of Non-arising of dharmas (
Tolerance of Non-Birth/ q.v.). Concerned
 for future beings, who will not have 
the benefit of Buddha's direct 
instruction, Vaidehi inquired about the 
methods for their rebirth. In response, 
the Buddha instructed her in the sixteen
 kinds of visualization. The first 
thirteen begin with the visualization of
 the setting sun in this Saha World, 
then move on to the physical features of
 the Sukhavati realm such as the ground,
 trees and lakes, and conclude with the 
features of Buddha Amitabha and his 
attendants, Bodhisattvas Avalokitesva 
and Mahasthamaprapata. The last three 
visualizations have as their object the 
people of the nine grades of rebirths, 
the level of their spiritual attainment,
 the quality of their death-bed welcome,
 and the length of time spent in 
Sukhavati before hearing the Dharma and 
attaining complete enlightenment. This 
<pb n="56"/>
section on the visualizations, which is 
four times longer than the prologue 
section, comprises the main body and the
 primary aim of the sutra. In the 
epilogue, which is one-third the length 
of the prologue, Vaidehi attains the 
Insight of Non-arising, (Tolerance of 
Non Birth/ q.v.) while the Buddha 
prophesies that her five hundred female 
attendants will attain rebirth in the 
Pure Land." 
'This sutra teaches sixteen kinds of 
meditation as a means for birth in the 
Pure Land. It concludes by saying that 
even the most sinful person can attain 
birth there by invoking singlemindedly 
and with utmost faith the name of 
Amitabha. "The Meditation Sutra was 
translated into Chinese by Kalayasas (
Ching-liang-yeh-shih) in 424 in one 
fascicle. There is said to have been 
another translation in Chinese of this 
sutra; but it was lost already by 730. 
Many Chinese commentaries were written 
on this sutra. The most famous of these 
is the commentary by Shan-tao (Zendo) 
which had a great influence on later 
generations." 
(II) Note:
"There is even a place in the Western 
<pb n="57"/>
Paradise for the worst sinners. The 
Meditation Sutra relates that even if a 
person has committed the Five Cardinal 
Sins, if this sinner on the verge of 
death singlemindedly recites Amitabha's 
name up to ten times, a lotus throne 
will appear and will bear him to the 
lowest stage in the Pure Land -- the 
lowest birth of the lowest degree. 
Instead of being condemned to eighty 
million kalpas in hell, the sinner will 
be born in the Western Paradise in a 
closed lotus flower ... This teaching of
 the nine possible levels of birth has 
been an extremely effective way to 
reward good deeds on earth while still 
offering the promise of salvation to all
, regardless of how much merit they had 
accumulated." (Joji Okazaki, Pure Land 
Buddhist Painting.52)

<xa>MEDIUMS</xa>
<_-xa>Fortune-telling</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Prophecies</_-xa>; <_-xa>Spirit World靈界 </_-xa>

"In many countries, people seek the 
advice and guidance of mediums to 
<pb n="58"/>
overcome their problems in situations 
which they consider beyond their 
comprehension. The medium's help is 
sought in many ways and for various 
reasons. In a time of sickness when 
medical help is apparently ineffective, 
some people become desperate and turn 
anywhere to seek solace. At such times, 
mediums are often consulted. Some people
 also turn to mediums when they are 
faced with a complex problem and are 
unable to find an acceptable solution. 
Others consult mediums out of greed in 
order to get rich quickly. Some people 
believe that when a medium is in a 
trance, the spirit of a certain god or 
deity communicates through the medium 
and offers advice or guidance to those 
seeking help. Others believe that the 
trance is the work of the subconscious 
mind which surfaces and takes over the 
conscious mind ... The Buddhist attitude
 towards consulting mediums is one of 
neutrality. It is difficult to verify 
whether what the medium conveys is 
correct or not. The practice of 
consulting mediums is not a Buddhist 
practice; it is just a traditional 
practice. Consulting mediums is for 
worldly material gain; the Teaching of 
<pb n="59"/>
the Buddha is for spiritual development.
" 

"Mediumship may be positive or negative.
 The former is rare, for it involves an 
advanced pupil, highly trained for the 
purpose, who allows his master to take 
possession of his lower vehicles or 
personality while the pupil retains full
 consciousness. Negative mediumship 
causes permanent damage to the medium, 
for as control of the lower principles 
is loosened by the invasion of some 
discarnate entity or elemental, it 
becomes that much easier for evil 
entities of any kind to take possession,
 and increasingly hard for the medium to
 resume responsibility. No evolved being
 would so use a medium and in such 
practices there is nothing whatsoever 
spiritual." 
Caveat: By avidly seeking contact with 
other worlds, a person may be subject to
 hallucinations or to manipulation by 
unscrupulous mediums.

<xa>MERIT</xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Virtue</_-xa>
<_-xa>Bodhidharma</_-xa>

"Merit is what one establishes by 
<pb n="61"/>
benefitting others... By practicing what
 is good, (i.e. decreasing greed, anger 
and ignorance) one improves oneself. 
This is virtue. Ideally both merits and 
virtues should be cultivated side by 
side." 
The two terms (merits and virtues) are 
sometimes used interchangeably. However,
 there is a crucial difference: merits 
are the blessings (wealth, intelligence,
 etc.) of the human and celestial realms
; therefore, they are temporary and 
subject to Birth and Death. Virtues, on 
the other hand, transcend Birth and 
Death and lead to Buddhahood. An 
identical action (e.g., charity) can 
lead either to merit or virtue, 
depending on the mind of the 
practitioner, that is, on whether he is 
seeking mundane rewards (merit) or 
transcendence by decreasing greed, anger
, and delusion (virtue). 
Subtle Buddhist teaching. Any good 
action leads to merit and virtue. The 
difference is in the level. Good actions
 performed with sincerity and no thought
 of giver, receiver or gift accrue 
boundless virtues which lead to rebirth 
outside the realm of Birth and Death (
referred to as "Non-outflow virtues"). 
<pb n="62"/>
Conversely, good actions performed 
without sincerity, for gain or fame, 
lead to merit "with outflows," i.e., 
limited and within Samsara. Such tainted
 merit accumulated within one's current 
lifetime may lead to rebirth within the 
human realm, in a position of wealth, 
power and authority (second lifetime). 
Since power tends to corrupt, the 
individual may then create evil karma, 
resulting in retribution in the Third 
Lifetime (q.v.). Therefore, merits and 
virtues "with outflows" are considered 
deluded. Thus, the Pure Land cultivator 
should not seek mundane merits, for by 
doing so he would in effect be choosing 
to remain within Samsara.

<xa>MERIT</xa>
"Buddha Recitation, like the use of koan
 in Zen, is a panacea (a cure-all) to 
destroy the poison of false thinking ...
 It is like fighting a war to end all 
wars. According to The Pure Land school,
 however, recitation of the Buddha's 
name contains an additional element: the
 practitioner by association absorbs 
<pb n="63"/>
some of the merit of the Buddha himself.
<_-xa>the following passage, with 
reference to the Bodhisattva 
Avalokitesvara (Kuan Yin), one of the 
Three ; Pure Land Sages: 'Some of us may
 ask whether the effect of (evil) karma 
can be ... changed by repeating the name
 of Kuan-Yin. This question is tied up 
with that of rebirth in Sukhavati (the 
Pure Land) and it may be answered by 
saying that invocation of Kuan-Yin's 
name forms another cause which will 
right away offset the previous karma. We
 know, for example, that if there is a 
dark, heavy cloud above, the chances are
 that it will rain. But we also know 
that if a strong wind should blow, the 
cloud will be carried away somewhere 
else and we will not feel the rain. 
Similarly, the addition of one big 
factor can alter the whole course of 
karma . It is only by accepting the idea
 of life as one whole that both 
Theravadins and Mahayanists can advocate
 the practice of transference of merit 
to others. With the case of Kuan-Yin 
then, by calling on Her name we identify
 ourselves with Her and as a result of 
this identification Her merits flow over
 to us. These merits which are now ours 
<pb n="64"/>
then counterbalance our bad karma and 
save us from calamity. The law of cause 
and effect still stands good. All that 
has happened is that a powerful and 
immensely good karma has overshadowed 
the weaker one ... If we want to go 
deeper, we may say that this 
identification with a Bodhisattva also 
means that a Bodhisattva identifies 
Himself with us. When this occurs, there
 is not only the mere transference of 
merit, but the non-discriminate, 
infinite, unqualifiable compassion of 
all the Bodhisattvas coming into us, 
lifting us, as it were, right up into 
Nirvana."' (Lecture on Kuan-Yin by Tech 
Eng Soon - Penang Buddhist Association,

<xa>METAPHYSICS</xa>
<_-xa>Silence</_-xa>; <_-xa>Universe宇宙</_-xa>; <_-xa>Mahayana/Theravada</_-xa>

Theravada Buddhism:
"Buddha preached a religion devoid of 
speculation. Ample evidence in the 
record suggests that he could have been 
one of the world's great metaphysicians 
if he had put his mind to the task. 
Instead, he flatly refused to discuss 
metaphysics. His silence on the subject 
did not pass unnoticed. 'Whether the 
world is eternal or not eternal, whether
 the world is finite or not, whether the
 soul is the same as the body or whether
 the soul is :.one thing and the body 
another, whether Buddha exists after 
death or does not exist after death -
these things,' one of his disciples 
observed, 'the Lord does not explain to 
me. And that he does not explain them to
 me does not please me, it does not suit
 me.' There were many it did not suit. 
Yet despite incessant needling, he 
continued his 'noble silence.' His 
reason was simple. 'Greed for views' on 
questions of this sort 'tends not to 
edification.' His practical program was 
exacting, and he was not going to let 
<pb n="66"/>
his flock be diverted from the hard road
 of arduous action by the agreeable 
fields of profitless speculation. His 
famous parable of the arrow smeared 
thickly with poison puts the point with 
precision: 
'It is as if a man had been wounded by 
an arrow thickly smeared with poison, 
and his friends and kinsmen were to get 
a surgeon to heal him, and he were to 
say, "I will not have this arrow pulled 
out until I know by what man I was 
wounded, whether he is of the warrior 
caste, or a brahmin, or of the 
agricultural, or the lowest caste." Or 
if he were to say, "I will not have this
 arrow pulled out until I know of what 
name of family the man is -- or whether 
he is tall, or short or of middle height
"... Before knowing all this, the man 
would die. Similarly, it is not on the 
view that the world is eternal, that it 
is finite, that body and soul are 
distinct, or that the Buddha exists 
after death that a religious life 
depends. Whether these views or their 
opposites are held, there is still 
rebirth, there is old age, there is 
death, and grief, lamentation, suffering
, sorrow, and despair.... I have not 
<pb n="67"/>
spoken to these views because they do 
not conduce to an absence of passion, to
 tranquility, and Nirvana. And what have
 I explained? Suffering have I explained
, the cause of suffering, the 
destruction of suffering, and the path 
that leads to the destruction of 
suffering have I explained. For this is 
useful."'

absence of an atman or soul, what truth 
is, why moral people encounter suffering
 while apparently evil people prosper, 
why suicide is not a valid antidote to 
earthly suffering, why philosophical 
discussion is not profitable, why

Thoughts</_-xa>

"Key concept in all Buddhist teaching. 
Frequent term in Zen, used in two senses
: (1) the mind-ground, the One Mind ... 
the Buddha-mind, the mind of thusness ..
. (2) false mind, the ordinary mind 
dominated by conditioning, desire, 
aversion, ignorance, and a false sense 
of self, the mind of delusion ..." (J.C.
 Cleary) 
The ordinary, deluded mind (thought) 
includes feelings, impressions, 
conceptions, consciousness, etc. The 
Self-Nature True Mind is the fundamental
 nature, the Original Face, reality, the
 "undiscriminating mind" etc. As an 
analogy, the Self-Nature True Mind is to
 mind what water is to waves -- the two 
cannot be dissociated. They are the same
 but they are also different. To 
approach the sutras "making 
discriminations and nurturing 
<pb n="75"/>
attachments" is no different from the 
Zen allegory of a person attempting to 
lift a chair while seated on it. If he 
would only get off the chair, he could 
raise it easily. Similarly, the 
practitioner truly understands the 
Dharma only to the extent that he "
suspends the operation of the 
discriminating intellect, the faculty of
 the internal dialogue through which 
people from moment to moment define and 
perpetuate their customary world of 
perception." 
(I) Mind creating all dharmas
The teaching of the Mind "creating" 
sentient beings and the environment 
expressed in many Mahayana sutras such 
as the Avatamsaka, Surangama and Lotus 
Sutras, is epitomized in the following 
stanza:
"If one wishes to understand fully/ All 
Buddhas of all time,/ He should 
contemplate the nature of the Dharma 
Realm/ Everything is made from Mind 
alone" (Avatamsaka Sutra,ch. 20). "One 
wholesome thought is the condition/ for 
the creation of the Buddha-lands;/ One 
errant thought/ is the very cause of the
 nine realms of Samsara."
"This does not mean creation in the 
<pb n="76"/>
sense of creating something out of 
nothing. This doctrine means that, 
practically speaking, the world only '
exists' as such because of our awareness
, and that what we take to be the world 
in itself is our experience and 
inference based thereon. The conceptual 
order which is taken to be 
characteristic of objective reality is, 
according to this doctrine, a projection
 of the mind, a description that filters
 and shapes experience in accord with 
mental habits developed throughout the 
history of the species, the civilization
, and the individual" (T. Cleary, The 
Flower Ornament Scripture (the 
Avatamsaka Sutra), Vol. I, p. 23).
"The mind ... 'creates' the world in the
 sense that it invests the phenomenal 
world with value. The remedy to this 
situation, according to Buddhism, is to 
still and calm the mind, to stop it from
 making discriminations and nurturing 
attachments toward certain phenomena and
 feelings of aversion toward others. 
When this state of calmness of mind is 
achieved, the darkness of ignorance and 
passion will be dispelled and the mind 
can perceive the underlying unity of the
 absolute. The individual will then have
<pb n="77"/>
 achieved the state of enlightenment and
 will be freed from the cycle of birth 
and death, because such a person is now 
totally above them both." (Burton Watson
, The Zen Teachings of Master Lin-Chi. )
"In what way can our minds change the 
environment for the better? Take the 
case of a person who has performed evil 
deeds and should be condemned to the 
sufferings of the hells for untold eons.
 Suppose that individual suddenly 
becomes extremely frightened and utterly
 ashamed, develops the Bodhi Mind, 
changes his ways, recites sutras and the
 Buddha's name cultivates personally and
 enjoins others to do likewise, seeking 
rebirth in the Pure Land. Thanks to this
 change of heart, the previous karma of 
hell is dissipated and transmuted into a
 lesser karma in the current lifetime. 
Thus, for example, he may be subject to 
contempt by others, suffer a bout of 
illness, become destitute or meet with 
unhappy events. After enduring such 
minor retribution, that person may 
escape Birth and Death and enter the '
stream of the sages,' transcending the 
ordinary world. As the Diamond Sutra 
states: If there is anyone who receives 
and keeps this Sutra but is maligned by 
<pb n="78"/>
others, such a person has created evil 
karma in previous lifetimes and should 
have descended upon the Evil Paths. As a
 result of this calumny, however, his 
past karma is instantly extinguished and
 he will attain Supreme Enlightenment. 
This is precisely the meaning of the 
mind changing life and the environment 
for the better." 
"The wind was making the temple flag 
flutter. There were two monks arguing. 
One said the flag was moving. One said 
the wind was moving. They argued back 
and forth without reaching the truth. 
The Sixth Patriarch said to them, 'It is
 not the wind moving, and it is not the 
flag moving. It is your minds that are 
moving.' The two monks were startled." (
J.C. Cleary, Meditating with Koans, p.
124.)
"The Buddha said: 'There was once 
someone who, plagued by ceaseless sexual
 desire, wished to castrate himself. The
 Buddha said to him, 'To cut off your 
sexual organs would not be as good as to
 'cut off' your mind. Your mind is like 
a supervisor: if the supervisor stops, 
his employees will also quit. If the 
deviant mind is not stopped, what good 
does it do to cut off the organs?'" 
<pb n="79"/>
Illustrative story:
"There was once a Zen monk who practiced
 in a deserted mountain area. Lonely and
 isolated, he had a deluded thought, 
wishing to have some fellow-cultivators 
practicing along with him to make life 
more bearable. Immediately, an old woman
 appeared from nowhere, leading two 
beautiful young girls by the hand, who, 
she said, lived in the village down in 
the valley. They had come, they claimed,
 to seek guidance in the Way. The monk, 
unsuspicious, immediately gave a Dharma 
talk to the group. One day, after many 
such visits over a period of time, the 
old woman respectfully requested that 
the two girls be allowed to become 
attendants to the monk and relieve him 
of his daily chores. The monk, hearing 
this, became suspicious. He reprimanded 
the old woman severely and refused the 
offer. The three women left, apparently 
angry and ashamed. The monk, intrigued, 
followed them discreetly until they 
disappeared around a bend in the road. 
When he reached the spot, he found it 
was a dead end with no habitation or 
anything else around, except for three 
very old trees, one big tree and two 
smaller ones. He thought it over and 
<pb n="80"/>
realized that he had been 'tested.' A 
fleeting thought occurred to him, that 
he should cut down the trees, start a 
bonfire, and burn them to the ground. At
 that moment, the three women reappeared
, repentant, begging him to forgive them
 and spare their lives. Therefore, the 
cultivator should remember: when the 
mind is still, all realms are calm; when
 delusion arises, demons are born." 
(II) Introspection required 
The purpose of the Dharma is not to "
feed" the mind but to calm it and rein 
it in. The monkey mind has to be brought
 back to its tree for samadhi and, 
ultimately, wisdom to be achieved. The 
discriminating, intellectual mind, so 
prized in everyday life, may assist in 
the initial understanding of the Dharma 
but it must be transcended and is 
certainly no substitute for practice. To
 approach the sutras with a 
discriminating mind is no different from
 the Zen allegory of a person attempting
 to lift a chair while seated on it. 
"Once it is clear, however, that the 
problem lies in the mind itself, or 
rather in the emotions that arise there,
 the simple but difficult task is to 
become aware of how thoughts emerge and 
<pb n="81"/>
develop. Again we find the same note of 
practical optimism. Just as the mind is 
the source of every suffering, likewise 
it is the wellspring of every joy. And 
once again, the good news is that the 
mind can be controlled and trained. 'If,
 with mindfulness rope,/The elephant of 
the mind is tethered all around,/Our 
fears will come to nothing,/Every virtue
 drop into our hands.' The essential 
problem, which a moment's reflection on 
experience will confirm, is not that 
defilements occur within our minds, but 
that nine times out of ten, we are not 
aware that they are there. Or rather, 
that by the time they obtrude upon our 
waking consciousness, they have usually 
acquired such dimensions and strength 
that in the ordinary run of things we 
are powerless to prevent their 
consequences. The sudden outburst of 
destructive anger, the lustful impulse, 
the cruel or arrogant word that can have
 life-changing consequences, must have 
had their source, perhaps a long time 
previously, in a momentary flash of 
impatience or desire that, had it been 
addressed to at the time, might easily 
have been neutralized and dispelled. All
 very well, but how precisely is one to 
<pb n="82"/>
become so perfectly self-possessed that 
no impulse of the mind, however slight, 
is able to pass unnoticed? Alas, there 
are no magical solutions. The technique 
prescribed by Shantideva is that of 
constant, unrelenting vigilance--a 
continuous advertence to what is 
happening within the inner forum. He 
says that we should guard our minds with
 the same care with which we would 
protect a broken or wounded arm while 
moving through an unruly crowd; and here
 again, the educative methods of fear 
and encouragement have their place. 
Shantideva recommends that as soon as we
 feel the urge to do anything--to speak 
or even to walk across the room--we 
should get into the habit of self-
scrutiny. The slightest impulses to 
negativity should be greeted with a 
total paralysis of the system: 'It's 
then that like a log you should remain.'
 No thought should be allowed to develop
 unchallenged into action. Given the 
required degree of self-awareness, it 
comes as no surprise that Shantideva 
should refer to the minutiae of everyday
 behavior--all the little things we 
habitually overlook, excusing ourselves 
with the thought that they are too 
<pb n="83"/>
insignificant to bother about. In such a
 practice, in fact, it is precisely the 
small, practically subliminal impulses 
and behavior patterns that require the 
closest attention." 
NOTE: 
In the Sutra in 42 Sections, the Buddha 
taught: "Do not trust your mind, only 
when you have become an Arhat (a sage) 
can you trust it". Since most of us have
 not achieved sagehood, the cardinal 
rule is to keep the mind under constant 
control and avoid situations where greed
, anger, and delusion may arise.

<_-xa>Avatamsaka Sutra</_-xa>

"The mind, Buddha and sentient beings: 
these three entities are not different."
 The Avatamsaka Sutra (Chap. 20) teaches
 that, if sentient beings are no longer 
deluded and become enlightened, then 
their Minds, the Buddhas and other 
sentient beings are not different, as 
they all partake of the same basic True 
Nature.

creations of mind.' This does not mean 
creation in the sense of creating 
something out of nothing. This doctrine 
means that, practically speaking, the 
world only 'exists' as such because of 
our awareness, and that what we take to 
be the world in itself is our experience
 and inferences based thereon. The 
conceptual order which is taken to be

characteristic of objective reality is..
.a projection of the mind.."



<xa>MIND-GROUND</xa>
<_-xa>Mind</_-xa>; <_-xa>Mind-Created</_-xa>

"A Buddhist term meaning the mind or 
mental ground from which all things 
spring."

"One's mind can include all the myriad 
things; therefore 'ground' is used as an
 analogy for the mind. The mind can give
 birth to all things and can also 
produce the wisdom of the sages. 
Likewise, the ground or earth produces 
myriad things."

<xa>MIND-MIRROR</xa>
"Basic doctrine in Avatamsaka

The sutras commonly compare the Self-
Nature to a mirror. The Mind-mirror of 
the Buddhas is bright, empty and still; 
the Mind-mirror of sentient beings is 
<pb n="86"/>
dull and clouded. However, the intrinsic
 nature of both mirrors (brightness) is 
the same. If sentient beings can wipe 
their Mind-mirror completely clean, they
 will return to their Self-Nature, the 
nature of the Buddhas -- they will 
become Buddhas. This is the basis of 
gradual cultivation, as taught in most 
Buddhist schools.

<xa>MIRACLES</xa>
<pb n="90"/>
<_-xa>Spiritual Powers</_-xa>

"What the modern secular imagination 
would regard as fantastic or 
extraordinary and what the Western 
religious imagination would regard as 
miraculous or supernatural is seen in 
the two Amitabha Sutras as inconceivable
, but explainable. Counterintuitive or 
apparently uncaused events are the 
natural consequence of a Buddha's power.
 This power, rooted in the vows, the 
merit, and the knowledge of Buddhas, 
brings about its effects in a manner 
that is effortless. Although such events
 may appear to us as being outside the 
normal chain of causation, they are 
spontaneous and miraculous only in the 
sense that they are not the result of 
our own agency." 
"Miracles are possible in Buddhism, even
 though the Buddha discouraged all 
display of miraculous or 
parapsychological powers as offering 
proof of spiritual attainment. He was 
first and foremost a pragmatist, a 
patient compassionate pragmatist. A 
story that is told of his response to a 
noted ascetic whose path he crossed on 
one of his journeys nicely illustrates 
<pb n="91"/>
his down-to-earth reaction to any 
extremes of yogic behavior. Encountering
 an ascetic practitioner of yoga at a 
river crossing, he entered into 
conversation as he often did when 
traveling, and was told that the yogin 
had achieved such mastery over his 
physical body that he could now cross 
the river walking on the water. The 
Buddha's comment was to the effect that 
such a feat, though remarkable,	seemed a
 rather useless expenditure of physical 
and psychological energy, since there 
was a good ferry crossing the river at 
regular intervals charging less than a 
penny for the ride."

In Mahayana sutras, a metaphor for truth

 while its brilliance is undiminished. 
<pb n="95"/>
"Many people would like to know the 
religious significance of the full moon 
and new moon. To Buddhists, there is a 
special religious significance 
especially during a full moon because 
certain important and outstanding events
 connected with the life of Lord Buddha 
took place during a full moon. The 
Buddha was born on a full moon. His 
renunciation took place on a full moon. 
His Enlightenment, the delivery of His 
first sermon, His passing away into 
Nibbana and many other important events 
associated with His life-span of eighty 
years, occurred on full moons. Buddhists
 all over the world have a high regard 
for full moons. They celebrate these 
days with religious fervour by observing
 precepts, practising meditation and by 
keeping away from the sensual worldly 
life. On such days they direct their 
attention to spiritual development. 
Apart from Buddhists, it is understood 
that other co-religionists also believe 
that there is some religious 
significance related to the various 
phases of the moon. They also observe 
certain religious disciplines such as 
fasting and praying during full moon 
days. ... It is believed that the moon, 
<pb n="96"/>
like the planets, exerts a considerable 
degree of influence on human beings. It 
has been observed that people suffering 
from mental ailments invariably have 
their passions and emotional feelings 
affected during full moons. The word '
lunatic' derives from the world 'lunar' 
(or moon) is most significant and 
indicates very clearly the influence of 
the moon on human life. Some people 
suffering from various forms of illness 
find their sickness aggravated during 
such periods. Researchers have found 
that certain phases of the moon not only
 affect humans and animals, but also 
influence plant life and other elements.
 Low-tides and high-tides are a direct 
result of the overpowering influence of 
the moon. ... 
In view of the possible influence of the
 moon, the ancient sages advised people 
to refrain from various commitments on 
this particular day and take it easy for
 the day. They are advised to relax 
their minds on this particular day and 
to devote their time to spiritual 
pursuits. All those who have developed 
their minds to a certain extent can 
achieve enlightenment since the brain is
 in an awakened state. Those who have 
<pb n="97"/>
not trained their minds through 
religious discipline are liable to be 
subjected to the strong influence of the
 moon. The Buddha attained His 
Enlightenment on a full moon for He had 
been developing and attuning it 
correctly for a long period. In days 
gone by, full moons and new moons were 
declared public holidays in many 
Buddhist countries and people were 
encouraged to devote their time to 
spiritual development. It was only 
during the colonial period in Asia that 
holidays were switched over to Sundays. 
In view of this, some Buddhist countries
 are now trying to re-introduce the 
former lunar system of holidays. It is 
advisable to observe full moons as a 
religious day to concentrate on peace 
and happiness by calming down the senses
. Many Buddhists observe the eight 
precepts on full moons, to be free from 
family commitments and to keep away from
 worldly pleasures in order to have 
peace of mind for their spiritual 
development. . When we consider all 
those occurences, we can understand why 
our ancestors and religious teachers 
have advised us to change our daily 
routine and to relax physically and 
<pb n="98"/>
mentally on full moons and new moons. 
The practice of religion is the most 
appropriate method for people to 
experience mental peace and physical 
relaxation. The Buddhists are merely 
observing the wisdom of the past when 
they devote more time to activities of a
 spiritual nature on New Moons and Full 
Moons."

"The light mysticism of Pure Land

enter Buddhism from elsewhere. When this
 question is answered in the affirmative
, Iran, especially its native system of 
Zoroastrianism, is often indicated as 
the source of the sun and light 
symbolism of the sutras on which Pure 
Land is spirituality based... Hard 
evidence for the influence of 
Zoroastrianism on Buddhism is, however, 
lacking, and in its absence the theory 
does not seem necessary. All of the main
 features of Pure Land Buddhism can be 
derived from Buddhist sutras and sastras
. The fact that these texts sometimes 
contain teachings similar to (though of 
course, not the same as) those of other 
religions need not be accepted as 
evidence of influence. From the Buddhist
 point of view, the similarities (should

Naga-rajas ('dragon kings' or 'dragon

"'One of the most important philosophers

Prajnaparamita Sutras. Nagarjuna's 
methodological approach of rejecting all

"Nagarjuna is revered in all of Mahayana

places as a Bodhisattva. Not only Zen, 
but also the Tantric branch of Buddhism

Patriarch Nagarjuna with "rediscovering"
 the Avatamsaka Sutra in the 3rd century
 AD. He is said to have "travelled" to 
the sea dragon's palace beneath the 
ocean to retrieve the sutra. Another 
account has it that he discovered the 
sutra in an abandoned monastery. 
<pb n="107"/>
Nagarjuna is the patriarch of the 
Madyamika (Middle Way) school and,

Salvation school (Pure Land). The latter
 represents the easy way of salvation, 
compared to, for example, the arduous 
path of Zen. 
"In the Lankavatara Sutra, (Sagakatham: 
163-166), the Buddha is asked who will 
teach the Mahayana after He has passed 
away. He replies (foretelling the coming
 of Nagarjuna and Nagarjuna's rebirth in
 the Pure Land): 'In Vedali, in the 
southern part, a Bhikshu most 
illustrious and distinguished will be 
born; his name will be Nagarjuna, he 
will be the destroyer of the one-sided

Pure Land Buddhism developed in India, 
China, Japan, Vietnam, and other East 
Asian countries, faith was placed in the
 saving grace of Amida (Sanskrit: 
Amitabha; Chinese A-mi-t'o) Buddha. As 
the abiding doctrinal tenet of the 
tradition, this faith was externally 
expressed in the mantric formula 'Namu 
Amida Butsu', repeated again and again 
by adherents of the belief. If properly 
<pb n="113"/>
recited, and with an appropriate mental 
perspective, it was felt that adepts 
could be reborn in the Western Paradise 
of Amida, from which salvation was more 
readily attainable. In China the 
practice was called Nien-Fo, in Vietnam,
 Niem Phat. It was felt that chanting 
the nembutsu was the most effective 
Buddhist practice for individuals in a 
period of Dharma decline (Dharma-Ending 
Age, q.v.)."
"The nembutsu constitutes the primary 
religious practice in the Pure Land 
tradition for individuals hoping to be 
reborn in the Pure Land of Amida Buddha.
 Considered by its proponents to be the 
most effective religious practice in 
times of Dharma decline, it consists of 
a repetition of the formula Namu Amida 
Butsu or 'Homage to Amida Buddha.' It is
 an expression of tariki or 'other-power
', literally, placing one's faith for 
salvation outside of one's own 
attainment, a practice which is 
sometimes contrasted with the notion of 
jiriki or 'self-power' in Zen."

"Originally meant total extinction of 
desire and suffering. Today it refers to
 the state of liberation through full
enlightenment. In Mahayana, Nirvana is 
classified into four categories: 1. 
Nirvana with residue, the state of a 
person who has realized the nature of 
Nirvana, but has not yet eliminated the 
five aggregates; 2. Nirvana without 
residue, wherein the aggregates have 
been eliminated; 3. Svabhava Nirvana, 
the primeval Nirvana which is always 
present, whether we realize it or not, 
and 4. Non-abiding Nirvana, in which one
 abides in neither Samsara nor ultimate 
quiescence. This is the Nirvana of the 
Buddhas and the highest Bodhisattvas." 
"In the West, Nirvana has often been 
misunderstood as mere annihilation; even
 in early Buddhism it was not so 
conceived. In many texts, to explain 
what is described as Nirvana, the simile
 of extinguishing a flame is used. The 
fire that goes out does not pass away, 
but merely becomes invisible by passing 
into space. Thus the term Nirvana does 
not indicate annihilation but rather 
entry into another mode of existence. 
The fire comes forth from space and 
returns back into it; thus Nirvana is a 
<pb n="124"/>
spiritual event that takes place in time
 but is also, in an unmanifest and 
imperishable sphere, always already 
there. This is the 'abode of immortality
,' which is not spatially located, but 
is rather transcendent, supramundane and
 only accessible to mystical experience.

<xa>NO</xa>
<_-xa>Karma</_-xa>; <_-xa>Third Lifetime</_-xa>

How do we reconcile bad happenings 
occuring to good people with the law of 
karma? The general answer is that karma 
extends over many lifetimes, and 
therefore our present good deeds may 
attenuate the bad results of past 
misdeeds but not necessarily eliminate 
them completely. 
Buddhism of Wisdom ＆ Faith/ excerpts:
"Buddha Sakyamuni once said to his 
disciple, Ananda, 'Some people perform 
good deeds all their lives, but at the 
time of death are reborn in the hells; 
<pb n="126"/>
others create bad karma all their lives,
 yet at the time of death are reborn in 
the heavens. Do you know the reason why?
' Ananda said, 'Great Master, please 
teach us the causes.' The Lord Buddha 
said, 'when those who perform good deeds
 are reborn in the hells, it is because 
their good karma in this life has not 
matured, while their bad karma from time
 immemorial has come to fruition. 
Conversely, when those who create bad 
karma in this lifetime are reborn in the
 heavens, it is because their bad karma 
in this life has not reached maturity, 
while their good karma from past lives 
has borne fruit. Good and bad karma 
interact for many lifetimes before 
emerging. As with debts, the most 
important is repaid first. Therefore the
 cultivator should be diligent in daily 
life, and not indifferent or lazy."' 
"Cultivators usually face three types of
 obstacles -- the Obstacle of 
Afflictions, the Obstacle of Karma and 
the Obstacle of Retribution -- with the 
Obstacle of Karma being the most 
dangerous. Yet, nothing usually happens 
when the practitioner first begins to 
cultivate, while the deeper his 
cultivation, the more obstacles he is 
<pb n="127"/>
bound to encounter. Why is this so? It 
is because as common people living in 
the Dharma-Ending Age, most of us, 
naturally, have heavy obstructing 
conditions. If not, we would have been 
reborn in the Dharma Semblance Age or 
the Perfect Dharma Age (see Dharma-
Ending Age). However, it is not 
cultivation that gives rise to obstacles
 but rather a phenomenon known as '
Commutation of karma.' Heavy karma is 
commuted into light karma, future karma 
is "reshuffled' into current karma. Let 
us suppose that we have ten parts of bad
 karma but that through cultivation we 
manage to eradicate seven parts, so that
 only three parts remain. Instead of 
having to repay that karma in the future
, thanks to our cultivation we may only 
have to endure light retribution in this
 very life, and thus be free to attain 
liberation swiftly. For example, in one 
of his previous lives, an Elder Precept 
Master had been a monarch, who had waged
 many wars to conquer neighboring 
kingdoms. Having committed such great 
karma of killing, he was destined to 
descend into the hells once his residual
 merits were exhausted. However, thanks 
to the Master's earnest cultivation and 
<pb n="128"/>
propagation of the Dharma, his evil 
karma was commuted into daily bouts of 
seizures, which made him feel as though 
many invisible swords were stabbing and 
slashing his body. This went on for two 
years before the disease disappeared."

 (Ryukoku University.) 
Pure land Buddhism: Dialogues (excerpts)
 
Question:
"I venture to think, is not rebirth in 
the Pure Land contrary to the Truth of 
Non-Birth? 
Answer: Elder Master Chih I has said: '
The wise, while earnestly striving for 
rebirth in the Pure Land, also 
understand that the nature of rebirth is
 intrinsically empty. This is true Non-
Birth, and also the meaning of "only 
when the Mind is pure, will the Buddha 
lands be pure." The dull and ignorant, 
on the other hand, are caught up in the 
concept of birth. Upon hearing the term 
Birth, they understand it as actual 
birth; hearing of Non-Birth, they (cling
 to its literal meaning) and think that 
there is no rebirth anywhere. Little do 
they realize that 'Birth is precisely 
Non-Birth, and Non-Birth does not hinder
 Birth.' It has also been said by a Zen 
Master: 'If we understand Birth as 
meaning real birth, we stray in the 
<pb n="131"/>
direction of Eternalism; if we 
understand Non-Birth as meaning that 
there is no actual birth, we commit the 
error of Nihilism. Birth and yet no 
Birth, no Birth and yet Birth, is truly 
the ultimate meaning.' Another Zen 
Master has said: 'Birth is definitely 
birth, but returning (to the Pure Land) 
is in fact non-returning.'
The explanations of these three Masters 
are very clear. I will now give a 
broader explanation, through the two 
concepts of 'Nature' and 'Marks.' From 
the point of view of Nature (noumenon), 
the True Mind is wonderful and silent; 
its nature is inherently unborn (no 
Birth). From the point of view of Marks,
 whenever there is a congruence of 
causes and conditions, the various Marks
 of Birth and Death falsely appear, as 
in a dream, from the True Mind. Because 
Nature is usually manifested through 
Marks, it is said that Non-Birth is 
Birth. Since Marks appear as a result of
 Nature, it is said that Birth is Non-
Birth. When we truly understand this 
truth, rebirth in the Pure Land is 
rebirth in the nature (state) of Mind-
Only; between Birth and no Birth, no 
contradiction in meaning exists!" (

<xa>NON-DUAL</xa>
<_-xa>不二</_-xa>
<_-xa>Non-Dual Method</_-xa>; <_-xa>Paradox
</_-xa>

The Non-Dual Truth represents No-Self 
and No-Dharma. 'No-Self, No Dharma (Non-
dual truth). These two terms refer to '
the concept of emptiness, void, sunyata,
 i.e., that entities have no fixed or 
independent nature. In (Theravada), 
emptiness is only applied to the person;
 in the Mahayana, on the other hand, all
 things are regarded as without essence.
" (Shambhala Dictionary of Buddhism and 
Zen.)
"Non-duality is synonymous with reality,
 voidness, etc. but it must be 
remembered that non-duality does not 
necessarily mean unity, that unity is 
only one of the pair unity-duality; 
hence non-duality implies non-unity as 
well." 
(The Holy Teaching of Vimalakirti) 
Thurman: 163 No-Self (emptiness of self)
 means true understanding that the five 
<pb n="133"/>
skandas, which together represent body 
and mind, are all born of causes and 
conditions. When these come apart, body 
and mind immediately disappear. There is
 no real 'self' as master. No-Dharma (
emptiness of all phenomena) means true 
understanding that the five skandas are 
empty (not only because they are 
aggregates) but by their very nature. 
Thus, the Heart Sutra states: 'The 
Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara illuminated 
the five skandas and saw that they were 
empty.' The truth of Emptiness of all 
Dharmas is precisely the True Mark, 
attained through eradication of 
delusions. Therefore, the Heart Sutra 
continues: 'Thus, the Bodhisattva 
Avalokitesvara overcame all ills and 
suffering.' Furthermore, the principle 
that the Dharma-body -- while being the 
basis of all marks -- is completely 
apart from such marks as birth, 
extinction, impermanence, permanence, 
existence and emptiness, conforms very 
much to the Truth. Hence the name 'True 
Marks.' This True Marks is common to 
sentient beings and Buddhas, but 
ordinary humans, as well as followers of
 the Two Vehicles, deludedly reject it 
and therefore cannot take advantage of 
<pb n="134"/>
it. It is as though you had a diamond 
sewn into the hem of your shirt but, 
unaware of it, must endure poverty and 
deprivation." 
NOTE: According to Patriarch Yin Kuang 
and others, there is a conceptual 
difference between Theravada and 
Mahayana. The Theravada school teaches 
that the self is a composite, an 
aggregate of many other elements, and is
 therefore empty (relative emptiness). 
In Mahayana Buddhism, all phenomena (
including the self) are empty in their 
very nature (absolute emptiness). 



<xa>NON-DUAL</xa>
<_-xa>不二法門</_-xa>
<_-xa>Dual Birth (State of)</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Ultimatism</_-xa>
Buddhism of Wisdom ＆ Faith/ excerpts:

"There are many doubts concerning the 
Pure Land method. This is because most 
cultivators are still attached to '
duality,' and have not reconciled 
essence and marks, existence and non-
existence, noumenon and phenomena. That 
is why they embrace essence to reject 
<pb n="135"/>
marks, noumenon to reject phenomena, 
Emptiness to reject Existence, and vice 
versa -- thus creating disputes, doubts 
and perplexity. Little do they suspect 
that there is mutual identity between 
noumenon and phenomena -phenomena are 
noumenon, noumenon is phenomena. If we 
divide them and consider them separately
, phenomena are not true phenomena, 
noumenon is not true noumenon. This is 
true also of essence and marks, 
existence and non-existence and other 
dualistic dharmas. For this reason, the 
Vimalakirti Sutra speaks of the non-dual
 method to destroy this attachment. Non-
dual means reconciling all things, 
penetrating into their very nature; it 
does not mean 'one.' This is the true 
realm of 'Mind-Only.' Any other doctrine
 based on the Dharma Doors (schools) of 
Existence or Emptiness is merely an 
expedient for teaching purposes. The 
sutras state: 'To tire of and abandon '
conditioned' virtues is the action of 
demons. Yet, to be greedy and attached 
to transcendental, unconditioned virtues
 is also demonic action. 'Ancient sages 
have also said: 'Conditioned dharmas, 
while illusory, cannot be abandoned if 
we are to attain the Way. Although 
<pb n="136"/>
unconditioned dharmas are true, if we 
become attached to them, our wisdom-
nature will not be comprehensive.' These
 words clearly show that on the path to 
Enlightenment, unconditioned and 
conditioned dharmas, noumenon and 
phenomena are inseparable.
It is also stated in the Treatise on the
 Middle Way: 'Because common sentient 
beings grasp at external forms, the 
sutras destroy this attachment with the 
truth of Emptiness. If as soon as they 
are free of the disease of attachment to
 Existence they fall into the error of 
grasping at Emptiness, there is no 
medicine that can help them.' As the 
Prajna Paramita Truth of Emptiness 
sounds lofty and miraculous, when 
worldly, educated people read this 
literature, they usually get caught up 
in the error of 'speaking on the level 
of principle' about everything and look 
down on those who follow forms and marks
 in their practice. Thus, they create 
the karma of arrogance and self-
importance. While they expound the Truth
 of Emptiness, their actions are 
entirely in the realm of Existence, as 
exemplified by the following couplet: 
'Above, their mouths speak about the 
<pb n="137"/>
totally wonderful,/ Below, their feet do
 not part with even a mote of dust.'"

"One who has reached the realization of 
<pb n="138"/>
emptiness (Tolerance of Non-Birth) will 
never regress from the Buddha/ 
Bodhisattva-path. Non-regression (non-
retrogression) sometimes simply denotes 
an advanced stage of aspiration and 
practice from which one will never 
retreat." 
"Not to turn back. Up to a certain stage
 in their development, all religious 
practitioners are subject to backsliding
. The Bodhisattva, when he has reached 
the seventh (in some traditions, the 
eighth) of the Ten Stages (q.v.) (i.e. 
the highest ten levels of the fifty-two 
levels of Bodhisattva practice), cannot 
backslide."
"The state or condition of 'not falling 
back' is the stage in a Bodhisattva's 
spiritual career beyond which there is 
no turning back, sliding back, or 
retrogression. This condition is 
presented as one of the blessings 
bestowed upon (or attained by) those 
reborn in the Land of Bliss. In the 
Amitabha Sutras, it is not clearly 
distinguished from the stages or 
conditions of being only one birth away 
from Enlightenment." 
Pure Land Buddhism 
Retrogression from the Way is the 
<pb n="139"/>
greatest setback for the cultivator. The
 core rationale for seeking rebirth in 
the Pure Land (rather than remaining on 
earth to pursue cultivation) is that 
within the Saha World, retrogression is 
a certainty for all but the most 
resolute practitioners. Sutras and 
commentaries abound with tales of 
retrogression by even the most advanced 
disciples. (See, for example, the story 
of Sariputra, a leading Arhat disciple 
of the Buddha, donating both of his eyes
 to save a Brahmin's mother as part of 
his practice of the paramita of charity,
 but then abandoning that paramita when 
one of the eyes was crushed and spat 
upon.)
"Another case: it is said that 
Shariputra was a practitioner of the 
Mahayana who had progressed far along 
the path. One day a demon appeared to 
him and, wishing to put him to the test 
and if possible contrive his downfall, 
asked him for his right hand. In reply, 
Shariputra cut it off and gave it to the
 demon. But the demon was angry and 
refused to accept it, complaining that 
Shariputra had impolitely offered it to 
him with his left! At this point, it is 
said that Shariputra lost hope of ever 
<pb n="140"/>
being able to satisfy the desires of 
beings, and turned from the Mahayana to 
pursue the path to Arhatship." 
All Buddhist methods lead ultimately to 
liberation. Most of these methods rely 
on self-effort. However, human beings 
are limited in spiritual development and
 motivation (and burdened with heavy 
karma accumulated from time immemorial).
 Thus, they cannot escape Birth and 
Death in one lifetime, and are in danger
 of retrogression during transmigration.
 Pure Land teachings offer an easy 
method to escape Birth and Death in one 
lifetime through rebirth in the Pure 
Land, where practitioners can continue 
cultivating without fear of 
retrogression.

"Unlike the UK, where Theravada Buddhism
 has always had a strong presence (see "
Europe, Buddhism in"), North America has
 always been predominantly Mahayana. The
 Pure Land school arrived early with 
Chinese and Japanese immigrants, 
followed at the beginning of the 
twentieth century by Zen. Proponents of 
the Meditation or Zen school were 
Japanese teachers, the most famous being
 D.T. Suzuki. More recently, other forms
 of Buddhism, such as Nichiren Shoshu 
and Tantrism have gained a following 
among the American public..." 
(After identifying the three types of 
Buddhism which currently co-exist in 
North America as (1) Elite Buddhism or 
the Buddhism practiced by the American 
middle class, (2) Evangelical Buddhism 
associated with such schools as Nichiren
 Shoshu, (3) Ethnic Buddhism or the 
Buddhism of the Asian-American community
, professor Jan Nattier of Indiana 
University continued:)
"The import pattern of transmission has 
resulted in the formation of the 
<pb n="142"/>
Buddhist groups I refer to as Elite 
Buddhism. These groups attract a 
clientele well above average in terms of
 income, education, and status. Almost 
all are college graduates (with the 
exception of some artistic and literary 
dropouts), and a substantial percentage 
have postgraduate training. Their 
education is far from ordinary: many 
have attended Ivy League colleges (or, 
in their early years, prep schools), and
 a high percentage have specialized in 
non-lucrative fields in the arts and 
humanities. This is a clientele, in sum,
 for which mere economic survival is 
seldom viewed as a problem... On the 
contrary, Elite Buddhists are 
overwhelmingly affiliated with a small 
and specific subset of the dozens of 
brands of Buddhism available on the 
world market today: namely, Tibetan 
Buddhism, Vipassana, and Zen.
An important clue as to why these three 
schools have been selected can be seen 
at a glance, for the names of two of the
 three mean 'meditation'... Of the three
 types of American Buddhism (Elite, 
Evangelical and Ethnic Buddhism), it is 
Elite Buddhism that is likely to bear 
the least resemblance to Buddhism as 
<pb n="143"/>
practiced in any Asian country..." 
"A fundamental characteristic of Elite 
Buddhism is its obsession with 
meditation. Or to put it another way -- 
for the rhetoric of Zen Patriarch Dogen 
(q.v.) and his ilk aside. Americans 
rarely sit in meditation just to sit -- 
Elite Buddhists are extraordinarily 
concerned with how to get enlightened. '
But that's what Buddhism is all about!' 
the reader may be saying. True, no doubt
, for the Buddha himself, and for his 
immediate circle of monastic disciples. 
True also for a small percentage of 
monks and nuns down through the 
centuries in various countries of 
Buddhist Asia. But Buddhism has 
historically consisted of a whole 
repertoire of ideas, practices, and 
institutions, and Elite Buddhism in the 
United Sates is characterized not only 
by its tremendous emphasis on meditation
 but also by its 'selecting out' of so 
many other items. To choose just two 
examples: the almost total absence of 
the central Buddhist institution of 
monasticism, and a noticeable lack of 
interest in the ethical precepts. (Note 
that serious concern with the precepts 
has generally arisen in Elite Buddhist 
<pb n="144"/>
communities only under duress, most 
commonly in the wake of a scandal.) Many
 other elements of Buddhist thought and 
practice are largely absent from these 
communities as well. The strong 
tradition of self reliance in Elite 
Buddhist circles is paralleled by a lack
 of interest in (and even condescension 
toward) traditional devotional 
activities involving reliance on various
 Buddhist divinities, and the emphasis 
on 'virtuoso' spiritual practices in Max
 Weber's sense -- e.g., Zen seshins, 
long Vipassana retreats, and complex 
Tibetan visualization meditations
-- seems to be correlated with a lack of
 interest in practices (including 
ethical precepts) that are perceived as 
elementary..." 

"It is among Ethnic Buddhists that we 
find the most complex and sophisticated 
picture of Buddhism of any of the groups
discussed. For them, Buddhism includes 
both monastics and laity, both intensive
 practices and small steps toward a 
better rebirth. It includes not only the
 teaching of doctrine but many of the 
values deeply embedded in specific 
cultural forms. Ethnic Buddhism, in sum,
<pb n="145"/>
 involves the entire fabric of life, not
 just of the individual but across 
generations. From this perspective, the 
Buddhism of both Elite and Evangelical 
groups appears quite truncated, since so
 much has been omitted from their 
repertoire. Yet this does not mean that 
Ethnic Buddhists have a panoramic and 
all-inclusive vision, for many would be 
surprised to find themselves lumped 
together with Buddhists they have never 
heard of before. In fact, the monoethnic
 character of these communities (at 
least at the beginning) does not lead to
 much interaction across ethnic lines. 
It is quite common for members of a 
Japanese temple, for example, to be 
unaware of the existence of a Burmese 
temple nearby, or for a Chinese group to
 operate without any knowledge of its 
Korean neighbors." 
Postscript:
There are a number of reasons for the 
relative success of Buddhism in the West
 in recent times. The two most important
 are its rational approach to the 
everyday issues of life and its teaching
 on compassion (q.v.). The compassion 
aspect extends to all creatures, big and
 small, and has as a corollary the 
<pb n="146"/>
practice of vegetarianism (q.v.). Indeed
, the teaching of compassion overshadows
 all other aspects of Buddhism and 
explains the growing success of Mahayana
 Buddhism in North America. 



<xa>NON-SEEKING</xa>
<_-xa>Ten Non-Seeking Practices</_-xa>



<xa>NOTORIOUS</xa>
<_-xa>Rebirth in the Pure Land</_-xa>; <_-xa>Pure Land School</_-xa>

This refers to two Chinese men, Chang 
Shan-ho (Vn./ Truong Thien Hoa) and 
Chang Chung-k'uei (Vn./ Truong Chung Qui
), mentioned repeatedly in Pure Land 
commentaries. Both made their living 
slaughtering animals, thus violating the
 most fundamental Buddhist precept -not 
to kill. They achieved rebirth in the 
Pure Land because at the time of death, 
their minds were pure, i.e., free of 
greed, anger and delusion. This was 
accomplished through singleminded 
concentration on Amitabha Buddha. It is 
this purity of mind, not the precise 
<pb n="147"/>
number of recitations, that is the 
source of liberation. 
Pure Land commentaries add that these 
cases are extremely rare and are the 
result of good karma accumulated in 
previous lifetimes. Otherwise, how could
 such men even meet good spiritual 
advisors at the time of death, let alone
 recite with one-pointedness of mind? 
Therefore the necessity of reciting the 
Buddha's name until single-mindedness is
 achieved during one's lifetime. 



<xa>NOUMENON</xa>
<_-xa>Ultimatism</_-xa>

(I) NOUMENON
"Principle, Inner truth, Inner pattern 
of things and events." 
Ultimate truth, principle, the abstract 
as opposed to the concrete, theory, 
absolute reality, universals. In the 
Avatamsaka Sutra, noumenon denotes the 
absolute, the mind. "...Laws that 
underline things and events in the 
phenomenal world." 
(II) PHENOMENA 
Conventional truth, everyday reality, 
<pb n="148"/>
the concrete as opposed to the abstract.
 "Things, events, particulars..., matter
, the concrete, and so forth." (CCC/BTT,
 p.256) 
Noumenon represents the essence of 
things in themselves, while phenomena or
 marks are the forms and characteristics
 of those things. For example, the 
phenomenal aspect of the precept not to 
take life is literally not to kill any 
sentient beings. The essence, or 
noumenal aspect of that precept is to 
foster compassion: it is because of 
compassion that we refrain from taking 
life. 
"Question. I have heard some people 
justify their actions from the so-called
 absolute perspective (noumenon), by 
saying that there is no good and no evil
. This is used as justification for 
behaving in a manner that I find 
disturbing. 
Answer. The fact is, there is good and 
evil. Emptiness, or the absolute, is one
 side, and the world of phenomena, or 
the relative, is the other side. The 
truth is to be found in neither of those
. Tweak the nose of the person who says 
he or she is absolute, beyond good and 
evil. Ask if it hurts." 
<pb n="149"/>
Pure Land Buddhism
"There are two aspects to Buddha 
Recitation - essence and practice. 
According to Elder Master Ou-I: 
A) 'BUDDHA RECITATION PRACTICE' means 
believing that there is a Western Pure 
Land and a Lord Buddha named Amitabha, 
but not yet realizing that 'this Mind 
makes Buddha, this Mind is Buddha.' It 
consists of resolutely seeking rebirth 
in the Pure Land and reciting as 
earnestly as a lost child longing for 
his mother, never forgetting her for a 
single moment. 'Buddha Recitation-
essence,' on the other hand, means 
believing and understanding that Lord 
Amitabha Buddha of the West inherently 
exists in full within our mind, is 
created by our mind, and making this 
sacred name -inherently existing in full
 within our mind and created by our mind
 -- the focus of our recitation, without
 a moment of neglect. In other words, '
Buddha Recitation practice' is the 
method of those who do not understand 
anything about meaning or essence, who 
just believe that there is a Land of 
Ultimate Bliss and a Buddha named 
Amitabha, and who fervently and 
earnestly recite the Buddha's name 
<pb n="150"/>
seeking rebirth there.
B) 'BUDDHA RECITATION ESSENCE' is the 
method of those who practice in an 
identical manner, but who also deeply 
realize that the Pure Land and Lord 
Amitabha Buddha are all in the True Mind
, manifested by the pure virtues of the 
True Mind. This being so, is there a 
difference between Buddha Recitation-
practice and Buddha Recitation-essence? 
Of course there is. Those who follow 
Buddha Recitation-practice see Amitabha 
Buddha as outside the Mind; therefore, 
opposing marks of subject-object still 
exist. Thus, such practice is not yet 
all encompassing and complete. Those who
 practice Buddha Recitation-essence 
thoroughly understand the True Mind and 
therefore sever all marks of subject-
object -- to recite is Buddha, to recite
 is Mind, reconciling Mind and Realm." 
C) CAVEAT:
"According to Elder Master Yin Kuang, 
Pure Land followers should not seek 
guidance on Pure Land matters from Zen 
Masters. This is because the answers of 
Zen Masters are all directed towards 
principle and essence, while the Pure 
Land approach is based on phenomena and 
marks. This being the case, and 
<pb n="151"/>
considering the different areas of 
emphasis, beginning Pure Land 
practitioners who do not yet fully 
understand essence and marks, noumenon 
and phenomena, will not only fail to 
benefit from the answers of Zen Masters,
 they may develop even greater doubts, 
perplexity and inconsistent views."

NOTE:
"Prof. Allan A. Andrews has noted that 
there are two levels of Pure Land 
practice, which have co-existed in China
 since the fourth century, beginning 
with the first two Patriarchs: Hui-yuan 
used Buddha Recitation to achieve prajna
 wisdom by his own self-efforts. T'an-
luan considered Buddha Recitation the 
best practice for salvation, that is, 
for rebirth, because it is the easiest 
practice through the power of Amida's 
compassionate vows. ('Nembutsu in the 
Chinese Pure Land Tradition.' In The 
Eastern Buddhist, Vol. 3, No. 2, p. 40.)
 Please note that understanding the dual
 nature of the Pure Land, as Mind-Only 
and as a separate entity, requires 
meditation and recitation -- not 
intellectual reasoning.
"In secular western thought awareness of
<pb n="152"/>
 psychological projection as a source of
 supernatural being has served to 
demythologize demons, goblins, angels 
and saints and rob them of their power. 
The Bardo Thodol (Tibetan Book of the 
Dead), however, speaks of the deities as
 'projections' but never as 'mere 
projections.' The deities are present 
and must be dealt with religiously ... 
not just by intellectual insight." (D.G.
 Dawe in The Perennial Dictionary of 
World Religions, p. 93.)

Excerpts/ "Buddhism of Wisdom and Faith"
 (Master T. Thien Tam)
"The karmic conditions that test and 
create obstacles for the practitioner 
have many different manifestations. I 
will summarize them in six points: 
l. INTERNAL 'TESTING CONDITIONS' 
During cultivation, some people suddenly
 develop thoughts of greed, anger, lust,
 jealousy, scorn and doubt. They may 
also suffer delusion, leading to 
drowsiness and sleep. These thoughts 
<pb n="156"/>
sometimes arise with great intensity, 
making the practitioner feel annoyed and
 upset over, at times, trivial matters. 
Sometimes auspicious and evil events 
alternate in his dreams. The specific 
details of these events are too numerous
 to be described. Faced with these 
occurrences, the practitioner should 
realize that these karmic marks have 
appeared as a consequence of his 
cultivation. He should immediately 
understand that all karmic occurrences 
and marks are illusory and dream-like; 
he should foster right thought and they 
will disappear one after another. 
Otherwise, he will certainly be swayed, 
lose his concentration and retrogress. 
The ancients used to say in this respect
: Do not fear an early manifestation of 
evil karma, fear only a late Awakening. 
Sometimes the practitioner, in the midst
 of intense cultivation, suddenly 
becomes confused and weary, which is a 
state difficult to fight off. At that 
very moment, he should arise and bow to 
the Buddhas or circumambulate the altar.
 Or else, he may take a temporary break,
 read a few pages of a book or rearrange
 some flowers, waiting for his mind to 
calm down before returning to the altar 
<pb n="157"/>
to resume recitation. Otherwise, the 
more he tries to focus his mind, the 
more scattered it becomes. This is a 
case of flexibility in cultivation. It 
is similar to the situation of a 
commander-in-chief facing an invading 
army as powerful as a river overflowing 
its banks. In such a situation, the 
general should stay on the defensive, 
consolidating his position, rather than 
charging into battle. Some 
practictioners suddenly feel solitary 
and isolated when reciting the Buddha's 
name like a single-note musical piece, 
and grow melancholy and bored. In such 
cases, they should not hesitate to add 
mantra or sutra recitation or 
visualization to their practice. 
2. EXTERNAL 'TESTING CONDITIONS' 
These are external obstacles creating 
difficult conditions which can make the 
practitioner retrogress. These obstacles
 include heat, noise, dirt and pollution
, freezing weather, or an outbreak of 
insects. When faced with these 
conditions, the cultivator should be 
flexible and not become attached to 
forms and appearances. He should just 
seek tranquillity and peace of mind. For
 instance, in sweltering heat, he should
<pb n="158"/>
 not mind donning a light robe to bow to
 the Buddhas, and then retiring to a 
shady spot outdoors to recite the Buddha
's name. At the end of the session, he 
can return to the altar to make his vows
 and transfer the merit. If the 
practitioner happens to be living in a 
mosquito-infested area, he can sit 
inside a net while reciting the Buddha's
 name. As another example, in northern 
climes, where the weather can be 
freezing, monks and nuns must dress 
carefully in socks, shoes and hats when 
going to the Buddha hall to recite 
sutras. Other people, with heavy karmic 
obstructions, do not experience untoward
 occurrences as long as they do not 
cultivate, but as soon as they are ready
 to bow before the altar, they develop 
headaches, grow dizzy, and are afflicted
 with all kinds of ailments. Or else, 
they may receive sudden visitors or 
encounter unusual events. 
Faced with these occurrences, the 
practitioner should redouble his efforts
 and find ways to cultivate flexibly. 
These ways depend on circumstances; they
 cannot all be described. One point, 
however, should always be kept in mind: 
when faced with difficult circumstances,
<pb n="159"/>
 pay attention to the mind, and do not 
cling to appearances and forms. The evil
, turbid Saha World has always been full
 of suffering and tears. Without 
perseverance and forbearance, it is very
 difficult to succeed in cultivation.
3. TESTING CONDITIONS CAUSED BY ADVERSE 
CIRCUMSTANCES.
Practitioners on the path of cultivation
 are at times impeded by adverse 
circumstances. Some are prevented from 
cultivating or frustrated in their 
practice by parents, brothers and 
sisters, wives, husbands or children. 
Others suddenly develop a chronic 
disease, from which they never 
completely recover. Still others are 
continually pursued by opponents and 
enemies looking for ways to harm them. 
Others are slandered or meet with 
misfortunes which land them in prison, 
subject to torture, or they are sent 
into exile. Others, again, victims of 
jealous competition or calumny, lose all
 peace of mind. This last occurrence is 
the most frequent. Such cases occur 
because of the power of evil karma. The 
ancients had a saying: 'There are 
instances of sudden praise and 
unexpected honors which are undeserved, 
<pb n="160"/>
and other instances, not deserving of 
blame, which create major opportunities 
for censure and contempt.'
4. TESTING CONDITIONS CAUSED BY '
FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES'. 
Some practitioners do not encounter 
adverse circumstances, but on the 
contrary, meet with favorable 
circumstances, such as having their 
wishes and prayers fulfilled. However, 
such successes belong to the category of
 'binding' conditions, rather than 
conditions conducive to liberation. Thus
, just as some practitioners set their 
minds to peaceful cultivation, they 
suddenly encounter opportunities leading
 to fame and fortune, 'beautiful forms 
and enchanting sounds.' Or else, family 
members, relatives and supporters seek 
to follow and serve them on their 
retreats. For example, a monk who has 
made up his mind to cultivate in earnest
 may suddenly be requested to become the
 abbot of a large temple complex. Or 
else, a layman may unexpectedly receive 
a letter inviting him to become a 
minister heading such and such a 
government department, or offering him 
the chance to participate in a business 
venture which promises a quick profit. 
<pb n="161"/>
These instances, all of which are 
advantageous under mundane circumstances
, are seductive to the cultivator, and 
may gradually lead to other 
complications. Ultimately, he may forget
 his high aspirations and retrogress. As
 the saying goes, more lives are lost in
 a flood than in a fire. Thus, on the 
path of cultivation, favorable 
circumstances should be feared more than
 unfavorable ones. Unfavorable events 
sometimes awaken the practitioner, 
making it easier for him to escape 
thoughts of attachment and redouble his 
efforts in cultivation. Favorable events
, on the other hand, may make him 
quietly retrogress, without being aware 
of it. When he suddenly awakens, he may 
discover that he has slipped far down 
the slope. The ancients have said: 'Even
 two or three favorable circumstances 
may cause one to be deluded until old 
age.' This saying is truly a ringing 
bell to wake cultivators up. Therefore, 
the challenge of favorable events is 
very subtle -practioners need to pay 
close attention to them. 
5. TESTING CONDITIONS OF A CLEAR, 
EXPLICIT NATURE. 
These are clear 'testing conditions' 
<pb n="162"/>
which occur right before the 
practitioner's eyes, without his 
realizing their implications. For 
instance, a monk of relatively mediocre 
talents and virtues becomes the object 
of adulation, praised for great merit, 
virtue and talent. He then develops a 
big ego and looks down on everyone, 
giving rise to thoughtless action 
resulting in his downfall. Or else we 
have the case of a layman with the 
potential to progress far along the Way.
 However he is blocked and opposed by 
others, who advise him, for example, 
that vegetarianism will make him sick, 
or that overly diligent mantra and 
Buddha Recitation will 'unleash his evil
 karma', causing him to encounter many 
untoward events. He then develops a 
cautious, anxious attitude, 
retrogressing in his determination to 
achieve the Way. There are also 
circumstances in which the practitioner 
realizes that to advance further is to 
invite failure and defeat, yet, out of 
ambition or pride, he continues all the 
same. Or else, even though the 
cultivator knows that external 
circumstances are illusory and dream-
like, he cannot let go of them, and thus
<pb n="163"/>
 brings great suffering upon himself. 
For example, there was once a monk who 
spent a good deal of effort and money 
hiring stonecutters, carpenters and 
masons to build a large temple complex 
on top of a mountain. As soon as the 
temple was completed, the monk, by then 
completely exhausted, became gravely ill
. Before passing away, he requested his 
disciples to carry him around the temple
 on a hammock, as he touched each and 
every stone, weeping and lamenting!
6. SILENT, HIDDEN TESTING CONDITIONS.
This refers to silent challenges, 
inconspicuous in nature. If the 
practitioner is not skillful in taking 
notice, they are very difficult to 
recognize and defeat. Some people, who 
may have recited the Buddha's name 
diligently in the beginning, grow 
worried and discouraged by deteriorating
 family finances or repeated failures in
 whatever they undertake, and abandon 
cultivation. Others see their affairs 
quietly progressing in a favorable way; 
they then become attached to profit and 
gain, forgetting all about the Way. 
Others diligently engage in Buddha and 
Sutra Recitation at the beginning, but 
because they fail to examine themselves,
<pb n="164"/>
 the afflictions within their minds 
increase with each passing day. They 
then grow lethargic and lazy, to the 
point where they do not recite a single 
time for months, or even years. Still 
others, although their lives are 
progressing normally, see their living 
conditions continuously fluctuating with
 changing external circumstances. With 
their minds always in confusion and 
directed toward the outside, they 
unwittingly neglect recitation or 
abandon it altogether. All the above are
 the fluctuating effects of good and bad
 karma, which have the power to 
influence the practitioner and retard 
his cultivation. They are therefore 
called 'trying, testing conditions.' 
When first taking up cultivation, every 
practitioner has a seed of good 
intentions. However, as they encounter 
karmic conditions, one after another, 
both internal and external, ninety-nine 
cultivators out of a hundred will fail. 
The ancients had a saying: 'In the first
 year of cultivation Buddha Amitabha is 
right before our eyes; the second year, 
He has already returned West; by the 
third year, if someone inquires about 
Him or requests recitation (at a funeral
<pb n="165"/>
, for example), payment is required 
before a few words are spoken or a few 
verses recited.' 
This saying reflects the points just 
discussed; practitioners should bear 
them in mind and take heed."

<xa>OFFERINGS</xa>
<_-xa>Dana</_-xa>

"Buddhist texts often contain ideal, 
stereotypical, or normative lists of the
 items to be offered in ritual worship. 
These lists usually contain most or all 
of the following: flowers, garlands, 
instrumental music, ointment, parasols, 
lamps, incense, cloths (robes), perfumes
, and flags and banners." 
Among the various offerings to the 
Buddhas, the offering of the Dharma is 
the highest because it enables the 
audience to transcend Birth and Death 
and ultimately attain Buddhahood. The 
offering of the Dharma is generally

"A collection of scriptural quotations 
outlining religious practices that lead 
to birth in Pure Land. It was compiled 
in 985 by the Japanese Buddhist priest 
Genshin (942-1017) of the Tendai school.
 The primary practice that he advocated 
was the Nembutsu (invoking the name of 
the Buddha Amida).
Genshin considered the Nembutsu best 
used in conjunction with meditation on 
Amida and his Pure Land, but for 
believers untrained in meditative 
techniques he recommended simple 
chanting of the name. The Ojo Yoshu made
 a strong impression on Pure Land 
Buddhists because of its graphic 
descriptions of the splendors of Pure 
Land and the terrors of hells. It became
 popular as a religious handbook on ways
 of performing the Nembutsu, including a
 deathbed ceremony involving Nembutsu 
chanting and meditation."

Syn: <_-xa>Single-Mindedness</_-xa>; <_-xa>
One-pointed Mind</_-xa>
<_-xa>Pure Land Buddhism (summary)</_-xa>;
 <_-xa>Rebirth in the Pure Land</_-xa>

Single-mindedness or singleminded 
concentration. In Pure Land Buddhism, 
achievement of one-pointedness of mind (
or single-mindedness), is an absolute 
necessary condition for achieving 
rebirth in the Pure Land (See Rebirth in
 the Pure Land)
"In this day and age, I have come across
 many people who do not try to 
concentrate at all, but recite the 
Buddha's name with a scattered mind and 
languid voice. As a consequence, we find
 very few persons whose efforts have 
succeeded during their lifetime, and 
occurrences of miraculous response at 
the time of death are (for the most part
) weak. For this reason I have made a 
special effort to explain this practice 
here. I urge that whenever you perform 
recollection of the Buddha, you do so 
with one pointedness of mind free of 
confusion, chanting the Buddha's name 
loudly in a steady stream of invocations
. Before long your efforts will bring 
success (Master Zunshi)." 
<pb n="177"/>
The concept of one-pointedness of mind 
is understood in two ways. For the 
Patriarchs Chih-i and Ou-i and others of
 the T'ien-Yai, Zen and Avatamsaka 
traditions, it is equivalent to 
concentration and samadhi. For Pure Land
 Patriarchs such as Tao-ch'o and Shan-
tao, on the other hand, it refers to 
recitation with utmost faith in Amitabha
 Buddha and the Pure Land. The two 
concepts are in essence the same (to 
recite with utmost faith necessarily 
leads to concentration and samadhi). 
Editor: na One-pointedness of mind, 
Complete faith, or utter sincerity: in 
practice, these expressions are used 
interchangeably, as a cultivator cannot 
have complete faith without being 
utterly sincere and singleminded (and 
vice versa).  
Pure Land Buddhism 
In the Meditation Sutra, the Buddha 
taught that if a person, on the verge of
 death, can recite the Buddha's name ten
 times singlemindedly, he will be reborn
 in the Pure Land. The passage raises 
several questions pertinent to Pure Land
 teachings that require clarification:
(a) Singleminded recitation. On the 
everyday level, this means focussing on 
<pb n="178"/>
Buddha Amitabha and Buddha Amitabha 
alone, to the exclusion of all other 
thoughts while reciting the Buddha's 
name. At a deeper level, the 
practitioner always focuses on Buddha 
Amitabha, be it during reciting sessions
 or outside of such sessions, when he is
 engaged in mundane activities -- i.e., 
at all times.
(b) Singleminded recitation of the 
Buddha's name ten times (or from one to 
seven days). According to the Amitabha 
Sutra, to achieve rebirth in the Pure 
Land, it is necessary to recite the 
Buddha's name from one to seven days to 
the level of one-pointedness of mind (i.
e., singleminded concentration). This, 
as any practitioner can attest, is an 
extremely difficult condition -- one 
which very few cultivators can ever hope
 to fulfill. Therefore, in the 
Meditation Sutra, the Buddha taught an 
alternate way: to recite the name of 
Amitabha Buddha with one-pointedness of 
mind ten times at the time of death. 
Please note, however, that this is a 
solution in-extremis, as at the time of 
death we are like turtles being skinned 
alive! The crucial condition is one-
pointedness of mind, which has been 
<pb n="179"/>
rendered variously as "with all one's 
heart", "without inversion", "with one 
Mind", "in all sincerity", "with utmost 
faith", etc. Unless the cultivator 
fulfills this condition, his mind will 
not be on the same wave length as that 
of Buddha Amitabha. Thus, he will not be
 in a position to take advantage of 
Amitabha Buddha's vow and achieve 
rebirth in the Pure Land. 
(c) Scattered Mind Recitation. Although 
the aim of Buddha Recitation is one-
pointedness of Mind, recitation with a 
scattered Mind also leads to 
accumulation of merits, albeit on a much
 smaller scale. This is because 
everything has its source in the Mind; 
thus, all recitation springs, by 
necessity, from some degree of purity of
 Mind. 
NOTE: 
According to the sutras, "Whether a 
practitioner focusses on the Buddha 
constantly throughout his life, or 
recites assiduously for three months, or
 forty-nine days, or one to seven days 
and nights, or recites only ten times 
each morning, as long as the 
practitioner holds the Buddha's name 
with deep faith and fervent vows, like a
<pb n="180"/>
 dragon encountering water or a tiger 
hidden deep in the mountains, he will be
 assisted by the Buddha's power and 
achieve rebirth in the Pure Land." (A 
dragon outside the ocean or a tiger 
without the protection of the forest has
 but one thought in mind: to return to 
its environment .. Recitation requires 
the same singleminded intensity.) 
The level of sincerity and devotion 
required for onepointedness of mind and 
rebirth in the Pure land is illustrated 
by the following story from the Nirvana 
Sutra:
"At that time Sessen Doji (a previous 
incarnation of Buddha Sakyamuni) had 
mastered the Brahman and other non-
Buddhist teachings but had not yet heard
 of Buddhism. The god Indra decided to 
test his resolve. He appeared before 
Sessen Doji in the form of a hungry 
demon and recited half a verse from a 
Buddhist teaching: 'All is changeable, 
nothing is constant. This is the law of 
Birth and Death.' Hearing this, Sessen 
Doji begged the demon to tell him the 
second half. The demon agreed but 
demanded his flesh and blood in payment.
 Sessen Doji gladly consented and the 
demon taught him the latter half of the 
<pb n="181"/>
verse: 'Extinguishing the cycle of Birth
 and Death, one enters the joy of 
Nirvana.' Sessen Doji scrawled this 
teaching on the rocks and trees for the 
sake of others who might pass by, and 
then jumped from a tall tree into the 
demon's mouth. Just at that moment the 
Demon changed back into the god Indra 
and caught him before he fell. He 
praised Sessen Doji's willingness to 
give his life for the Dharma and 
predicted that he would certainly attain
 Buddhahood."

<_-xa>Ten Recitations Method</_-xa>

NB. Please read the entry Buddha 
Recitation (Methods) before the 
following excerpts from "Buddhism of 
Wisdom and Faith" (Master T. Thien Tam).
"Oral Recitation is the most common Pure
<pb n="182"/>
 Land method at the present time. 
However, this method has many variations
 to
accommodate the circumstances and 
capacities of the individual. A few of 
these variants are summarized below. 
1. REFLECTING THE NAME RECITATION. With 
this technique, the ear catches the 
sound as the mouth recites, examining 
each individual word and each individual
 phrase, to make sure they are clear and
 distinct, phrase after phrase. There 
are two ways of hearing, with the ears 
or with the mind. Although the ears '
hear deep inside,' the sounds do not 
reside anywhere. The practitioner 
gradually forgets everything inside and 
out -- even body, mind, realm, time and 
space -with only the Buddha's name 
remaining. This technique of 'reflecting
 the name,' makes it easy for the 
cultivator to filter out deluded 
thoughts and swiftly achieve one-
pointedness of mind. The Surangama Sutra
 expresses this very idea when it states
, in the words of the Bodhisattva 
Manjusri: This common method of 
concentrating the mind on its sense of 
hearing, turning it inward ... is most 
feasible and wise. (Wai-tao, tr. The 
<pb n="183"/>
Surangama Sutra, in D. Goddard, ed., 
Buddhist Bible, p 260.)
2. COUNTING ROSARY BEADS RECITATION. In 
this method, as the mouth recites, the 
hand fingers the rosary. At first, 
thoughts are tied to the rosary beads, 
but later on they gradually move away 
from the beads, leading to the state of 
onepointedness of mind. This technique 
increases the power of recitation in the
 same way that a cane enables a mountain
 climber with weak legs to ascend higher
 and higher. With this technique, we 
should write down the number of 
recitations per session or per day. This
 has the advantage of forcing us to keep
 an exact count, eliminating the 
affliction of laziness. However, we 
should take care not to be too ambitious
, attempting to achieve too much too 
soon, or our recitation will not be 
clear and distinct. The ancients, while 
reciting the Buddha's name over and over
, did so in a clear, distinct manner 
thanks to two factors: 'correct 
understanding' and 'correct 
concentration of mind.' 
3. BREATH-BY-BREATH RECITATION. This 
technique consists of reciting silently 
or softly, with each breath, inhaling or
<pb n="184"/>
 exhaling, accompanied by one recitation
 of the Buddha's name. Since life is 
linked to breath, if we take advantage 
of breath while practicing Buddha 
Recitation, we will not be apart from 
Buddha Amitabha in life, and at the time
 of death, when breath has stopped, we 
will be immediately reborn in the Pure 
Land. The practitioner should remember, 
however, that once he has mastered this 
technique, he should recite aloud as 
well as silently. In this way, the power
 of recitation will be strengthened and 
the will to be reborn in the Pure Land 
more easily developed. Otherwise, his 
resolve will not be earnest and he might
 'stray' into the practice of the 'Five 
Meditations to calm the mind' of the 
Theravada tradition. 
4. CONTINUOUSLY LINKED RECITATION. With 
this technique, the practitioner recites
 softly, each word following the one 
immediately before, each phrase closely 
following the previous phrase... During 
this practice, through discretion and 
patience, there are no empty time frames
 and therefore 'sundry thoughts' cannot 
intrude. The cultivator's feelings and 
thoughts are intense, his mind and words
 move boldly forward reciting the Buddha
<pb n="185"/>
's name; the power of right thought 
embraces everything, temporarily 
subduing ignorance and delusive thought.
 Thus, the light of transcendental 
samadhi breaks through and shines forth.
 From early times, Pure Land 
practitioners would avail themselves of 
this method when their emotions and 
thoughts wandered or were in a state of 
confusion. 
5. ENLIGHTENED, ILLUMINATING RECITATION.
 With this technique, the practitioner 
on the one hand recites the Buddha's 
name and on the other, 'returns the 
light' and illumines his True Nature. He
 thus enters into the realm of ultimate 
transcendental emptiness; what remains 
is only the consciousness that his body-
mind and the True Mind of the Buddha 
have become one -- all-illuminating and 
all-encompassing. At that time, 
meditation rooms, cushions, gongs and 
all else have disappeared. Even the 
illusory, 'composite body' is nowhere to
 be found. 
6. BOWING TO THE BUDDHA RECITATION. This
 technique consists of making bows as we
 recite the Buddha's name. Either we 
recite once before each bow or we bow as
 we recite, regardless of the number of 
<pb n="186"/>
recitations. The bowing should be supple
 yet deliberate, complementing 
recitation, bowing and reciting 
perfectly synchronized. If we add a 
sincere and earnest mind, body, speech 
and mind are gathered together. Except 
for the words Amitabha Buddha, there is 
not the slightest deluded thought. This 
method has the ability to destroy the 
karma of drowsiness. Its benefits are 
very great, because the practitioner 
engages in recitation with his body, 
speech and mind. A lay practitioner of 
old used to follow this method. Each day
 and night, he would bow and recite an 
average of one thousand times. However, 
this practice is the particular domain 
of those with strong mind-power. Lacking
 this quality, it is difficult to 
persevere, because with extended bowing,
 the body easily grows weary, leading to
 discouragement. Therefore, this method 
is normally used in conjunction with 
other methods and is not practiced in 
exclusivity. 
7. DECIMAL RECORDING RECITATION. This is
 the inscription technique of Buddha 
Recitation, taking each ten utterances 
of the Buddha's name as a unit. 
Individuals with short breath spans can 
<pb n="187"/>
divide the ten utterances into two 
subunits (five utterances each) or three
 smaller subunits (two three-utterance 
units and one four-utterance unit). One 
rosary bead is fingered after each group
 of ten utterances is completed. With 
this practice, the mind must not only 
recite, it must also remember the number
 of utterances. In this way, if we are 
not diligent we must become so; 
otherwise, it will be impossible to 
avoid mistakes. This technique, in 
general, is an excellent expedient 
forcing the cultivator to concentrate 
his mind and is very effective with 
those subject to many errant thoughts. 
Elder Master Yin Kuang used to recommend
 it to Pure Land practitioners. 
8. LOTUS BLOSSOM RECITATION. As he 
recites, the practitioner contemplates 
the four colors of the lotus blossom (
blue, yellow, red and white), one color 
after another without interruption. With
 his first utterance of the Buddha's 
name he visualizes a huge, blue lotus 
blossom before his eyes, emitting a blue
 light. With the second utterance, he 
visualizes a yellow lotus blossom, 
emitting a yellow light. The third and 
fourth utterances are accompanied, 
<pb n="188"/>
respectively, by visualization of red 
and white lotus flowers, each color 
emitting its own light. He then repeats 
the visualization in the same sequence. 
As the flowers appear, he imagines a 
vague, lingering touch of pure, soft 
lotus fragrance. Ancient masters devised
 this method because many practitioners 
in the T'ien T'ai School, despite using 
all available techniques, found it 
difficult to stem their errant thoughts.
 This method uses various forms and 
colors to focus mind and thought. These 
forms and colors take the marks of lotus
 blossoms in the Seven-Jewel Pond of the
 Pure Land ('one utterance of the Buddha
's name, one jewelled lotus blossom'), 
because the lotus blossoms appearing in 
the Pure Land are inseparable from the 
lotus blossoms created by the virtues of
 the reciting mind. At the time of death
, the mind, consciousness of the 
practitioner "relies on these jewelled 
lotus" blossoms to achieve rebirth in 
the Western Pure Land. If the Pure Land 
cultivator should discover that he has 
an affinity with this technique, he 
should apply it and quickly enter the 
Wonderful Lotus Blossom Buddha 
Recitation Samadhi. 
<pb n="189"/>
9. RECITATION AMIDST LIGHT. This method 
was specially designed for certain 
practitioners who, as soon as they close
 their eyes to recite, suddenly see 
filthy forms and marks (ugly grimacing 
faces, for example), or dark forms and 
colors swirling around. With this 
technique, the practitioner, while 
reciting the Buddha's name, visualizes 
himself seated in the middle of an 
immense, brilliant zone of light. Within
 that zone of light, when his mind has 
quieted down, the practitioner feels 
bright and refreshed. At that time, not 
only have deluded thoughts been 
annihilated, but filthy, evil forms have
 also disappeared. After that, right 
thought is reinforced and samadhi is, in
 time, achieved. Although this is a 
special expedient to destroy evil 
deluded marks, even the practitioner who
 is not in this predicament can apply 
this method to clear his mind and enter 
deeply into the Buddha Recitation 
Samadhi. 
10. 'CONTEMPLATION OF THE BUDDHA' 
RECITATION. The methods of contemplation
 taught in the Meditation Sutra are very
 important and lead to immense virtue, 
but they are not a popular expedient for
<pb n="190"/>
 sentient beings in the Dharma-Ending 
Age. Nevertheless, since the ancient 
masters did not wish to see the special 
benefits of the meditation method go 
unused, they selected the easiest of the
 Sixteen Contemplations (Contemplation 
of Amitabha Buddha) and combined it with
 Oral Recitation to form the 
Contemplation of the Buddha-Oral 
Recitation technique. (Recitation is 
predominant, while contemplation is 
secondary.) Each day, after reciting the
 Buddha's name, the practitioner 
reserves a special period of time for 
concentrating his mind and contemplating
 the Embellishments and Light of 
Amitabha Buddha. This method is derived 
from Contemplation Number Thirteen in 
the Meditation Sutra, in which Buddha 
Amitabha is visualized as some sixteen 
feet tall and of golden hue, standing at
 the edge of the Seven-Jewel Pond. If 
the practitioner cannot yet visualize 
the Seven-Jewel Pond, he can picture 
Amitabha Buddha standing before his eyes
 in a zone of light, in open space, the 
left hand held at chest level and 
forming the auspicious mudra, the right 
arm extending downward in the position 
of 'welcoming and guiding.' To be 
<pb n="191"/>
successful in this meditation, it is 
necessary, at the outset, to visualize 
the body of Amitabha Buddha in general, 
then concentrate on the urna (white mark
 between the eyebrows). This mark is 
empty and transparent, like a white gem 
with eight facets ... The urna is the 
basic mark among the thirty-two 
auspicious marks of the Buddhas. When 
this visualization is successful, thanks
 to the affinity thus created between 
Amitabha Buddha and the practitioner, 
other marks will appear clearly, one 
after another. However, to ensure 
success, the practitioner should read 
through the Meditation Sutra, memorizing
 the thirty-two auspicious marks of 
Buddha Amitabha before commencing his 
practice. With this method, Buddha 
Recitation should be primary, because if
 the practitioner does not succeed at 
visualization, he can still fall back on
 recitation to ensure rebirth in the 
Pure Land. In truth, however, recitation
 aids visualization and visualization 
complements recitation, so that these 
two aspects work in parallel, leading 
the practitioner toward the desired goal
. Although this technique is somewhat 
more difficult than the others, if it 
<pb n="192"/>
can be accomplished successfully, 
immeasurable benefits are achieved. It 
is therefore described here at the very 
end, to foster diligent practice.
As stated earlier, these ten variants of
 Oral Recitation are also the ten basic 
techniques to combat the various mental 
hindrances faced by Buddha Recitation 
practitioners. Pure Land books discuss 
several dozen variants. However, they 
are merely techniques using, inter alia,
 a loud voice or a low voice, at busy 
moments or at times of leisure. They 
cannot as such qualify as methods of 
recitation. For this reason, the author 
has singled out these ten basic variants
 of Oral Recitation to combat the 
obstructions of drowsiness and mind-
scattering. They are the methods best 
suited to the majority of today's 
practitioners. The cultivator can try 
them out and select the one - that fits 
his particular case."

<xa>ORDINATION</xa>
<_-xa>Sacerdotal Age</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Pratimoksa</_-xa>

"Ordinations in Buddhism (especially in 
Theravada) are not considered life long 
commitments. At any time, a monk or nun 
may voluntarily elect to leave the 
monastic community and return to lay 
life." 
"Ordination, in Buddhism, is initiation 
into the Buddhist Order (Sangha) in the 
presence of witnesses (i.e., members of 
Sangha), and self-dedication to monastic
 life... It is not necessarily life-long
 or unrepeatable. There are two kinds of
 Buddhist Ordination: the lower, by 
which a man becomes a samanera or novice
; the higher by which a novice becomes a
 monk (bhikkhu). The more formal 
ceremony for admission of a novice who 
intends to become a monk subsequently 
consists of a candidate's being brought 
before a chapter of at least 10 monks, 
headed by an abbot or senior monk of at 
least ten years' standing, and taking 
part in set form for the ordaining of 
<pb n="194"/>
novices and monks. This is held in the 
sanctuary (vihara). The candidate kneels
, and asks for admission as novice, 
handing to the abbot two yellow robes in
 which he is to be ordained. The abbot 
then formally presents to him these 
robes, reminding him of the frailty and 
impermanence of the human body which 
they are to cover. The candidate 
receives them, and retires to put them 
on; as he does so he recites a formula 
reminding himself that his robes are 
worn as protection against cold and heat
 and to cover nakedness, and that he 
wears them in all humility, for use and 
not for ornament. He then returns, makes
 obeisance, and asks to have 
administered to him the Three Refuges 
and Ten Precepts. Having received them 
from the abbot, repeating them sentence 
by sentence, he makes obeisance, seeks 
forgiveness by his brethren of all 
faults and declares his wish to share 
with his brethren any merit he has 
gained. The samanera spends his time in 
a monastery learning the life of the 
Sangha, helping with daily chores, etc. 
He does not attend recitation, twice 
monthly, of Pratimoksa (q.v.); this is 
attended only by bhikkhus. When a novice
<pb n="195"/>
 subsequently seeks higher ordination (
upasampada) as monk, he first goes 
through the form for the ordination of a
 novice again; this is then followed by 
a further and longer ceremony of 
ordination in the course of which a 
candidate must be able to answer 
satisfactorily a list of questions 
concerning his status and condition (
whether he is free from disease, debt, 
obligation to serve in the military, is 
20 years of age, etc.). He is presented 
by one of his two tutors. On this 
occasion, the three robes, including a 
stole, are presented. These are then 
ceremonially returned to him by the 
abbot. An address is then given by the 
abbot, or president, in which the new 
bhikkhu is reminded of the glory of the 
life of a bhikkhu, and of the high moral
 standards which must now be his, and 
the chaste, honest, peaceable and humble
 life he must live. Ordinations are held
 at any time of the year except the 
three months of Vesak. The actual date 
is agreed upon in consultation with the

Bodhisattva: to gain complete, perfect 
enlightenment for the sake of all 
sentient beings."

Syn: <_-xa>Tariki</_-xa>
<_-xa>Self-Power</_-xa>; <_-xa>Dedication 
of Merit回向</_-xa>; <_-xa>Other-Worldly</_-xa>
"The power of the other, i.e., the 
Buddhas, particularly Amitabha. This 
term suggests the idea of seeking 
rebirth in the Pure Land by relying (
principally) on the power of Amitabha. 
Other-power is used in contrast to self-
power." 
"Sometimes it is suggested that the 
emphasis on devotion as providing a 
special kind of salvation is unnatural 
in Buddhism and alien to the earlier 
tradition. Yet even the earliest form of
 Buddhism known to us taught that faith 
in the Buddha was able both to bring 
about a heavenly rebirth and to set one 
firmly on the path to liberation. The 
difference is in the Mahayana emphasis 
on the 'power of resolve' (other power) 
of a Buddha, which is capable of 
creating enormously favourable 
conditions." 
<pb n="202"/>
(I) Other Power/ Self Power 
'Jiriki (self-power) is the Wisdom 
aspect of enlightenment and tariki (
other-power) is the ... Great Compassion
 aspect of the same. By wisdom we 
transcend the principle of individuation
, and by Great Compassion we descend 
into a world of particulars. The one 
goes upwards while the other comes 
downwards, but this is our intellectual 
way of understanding and interpreting 
enlightenment, in whose movement however
 there is no such twofold direction 
discernible." (The Eastern Buddhist, Vol
. 3. No. 4, p. 314.) 
(II) Amitabha Buddha
"Other-power is a technical term 
indicating a religious attainment 
achieved through such activities as 
placing one's faith in the saving grace 
of a Buddha or other religious figures. 
Other-power is almost always played off 
against 'Self-power', a term readily 
utilized in the Zen tradition to 
indicate a religious attainment achieved
 (mainly) through one's own striving. '
Other Power' is most often associated 
with the Pure Land tradition, in which 
rebirth in the Pure Land is obtained by 
chanting the Buddha's name." 
<pb n="203"/>
"As far as the question of 'self-power' 
vs. 'other-power' is concerned, it is 
wrong to understand the Pure Land method
 as exclusive reliance on Buddha 
Amitabha's power. The Pure Land 
practitioner should use all his own 
power to rid himself of afflictions, 
while reciting to the point where his 
mind and the Mind of Amitabha Buddha are
 in unison. At that moment, in this very
 life, (he will experience an awakening)
 and at his death, he will be welcomed 
and guided back to the Pure Land. The '
welcoming and escorting' feature is 
really the principal manifestation of '
other-power.' As an analogy, for a 
student to exert his own efforts to the 
utmost is, of course, a laudable thing. 
If, in addition, he has the benefit of 
an excellent teacher who follows his 
progress and assists him, his level of 
achievement will be higher, resulting in
 assured success in his final 
examinations. Adding other-power to self
-power is similar. Therefore, how can it
 be considered mistaken to exert all of 
our own efforts to cultivate and then 
seek additional help to achieve rapid 
success?" (from Buddhism Wisdom and 
Faith) 
<pb n="204"/>
(III) Medicine Buddha
"Invisible assistance -- provided by the
 Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of Healing -- 
can be a potent aid in this process (of 
elimination of the three poisons of lust
, anger and delusion). This assistance 
often is described as stemming from the 
force of their fundamental vows, which 
they made when they dedicated their 
lives to spiritual work. The vows to 
heal all beings and alleviate various 
sufferings serve as special motivating 
factors in their spiritual development. 
Upon fruition of their spiritual work ..
. they then truly become able to fulfill
 these vows." (Raoul Birnbaum, The 
Healing Buddha.) 
(IV) Note 
The issue of other-power (Buddha's power
) is often misunderstood and glossed 
over by many Buddhists. However, it must
 be pointed out that, in Buddhism, other
-power is absolutely necessary if a 
Bodhisattva is to attain Ultimate 
Enlightenment. The Avatamsaka Sutra (
described by D.T. Suzuki as the epitome 
of Buddhist thought) and the Lankavatara
 Sutra (the only sutra recommended by 
Bodhidharma) are emphatically clear on 
this point:
<pb n="205"/>
"As long as (conversion) is an 
experience and not mere understanding, 
it is evident that self-discipline plays
 an important role in the Buddhist life.
.. but... we must not forget the fact 
that the Lanka (Lankavatara Sutra) also 
emphasizes the necessity of the Buddha's
 power being added to the Bodhisattvas' 
in their upward course of spiritual 
development and in the accomplishment of
 their great task of world salvation. If
 they were not thus so constantly 
sustained by the miraculous power of the
 Buddha, they would speedily fall into 
the group of philosophers and Sravakas, 
and they would never be able to attain 
Supreme Enlightenment and preach the 
doctrine of universal emancipation." (D.
T. Suzuki, tr., the Lankavatara Sutra, p
. xviii.)
<_-xa>the following quote from the 
Avatamsaka Sutra:</_-xa>
"Having purified wisdom and means in the
 seventh Stage .../ The great sages 
attain acceptance of non-origination ...
/ On the basis of their previous 
resolution,/ The Buddhas further exhort 
them .../ 'Though you have extinguished 
the burning of the fire of affliction,/ 
Having seen the world still afflicted, 
<pb n="206"/>
remember your past vows;/ Having thought
 of the welfare of the world, work in 
quest/ Of the cause of knowledge, for 
the liberation of the world."' (T. 
Cleary, tr., The Flower Ornament Sutra, 
Vol II) 



<xa>OTHER-WORDLY</xa>
<_-xa>Other-power</_-xa>; <_-xa>Pure Land 
Buddhism (summary)</_-xa>

"Among the many varieties of Buddhism, 
the Pure Land teaching most deserves the
 epithet 'other-worldly,' often 
erroneously applied to Buddhism as a 
whole. Pure Land doctrine teaches that 
this world is an arena of unavoidable 
suffering and frustration, and holds out
 the vivid prospect of rebirth in 
another, better world, where sickness, 
pain and death do not exist. This world 
is a hopeless trap, from which we can 
escape only by the power of Amitabha. 
Unless we attain rebirth in the Pure 
Land, peace and happiness, to say 
nothing of enlightenment, are beyond 
reach ... From a Buddhist perspective, 
it is the modern 'this-worldly' 
<pb n="207"/>
orientation to life that is a form of 
unrealistic escapism and unwarranted 
pessimism about human possibilities. It 
is unrealistic because it seeks the 
meaning of life in gratifications that 
can only be temporary and partial: it 
seeks escape from mortality in transient
 pleasures. It is unnecessarily 
pessimistic because it ignores or denies
 the transcendental capacity inherent in
 humankind: 'turning one's back on 
enlightenment to join with the dusts.'" 
(J.C. Cleary, Pure Land, Pure Mind, 
Introduction.)
"Here we find an important point of 
soteriological convergence between Pure 
Land ritual/meditative manuals and Pure 
Land hagiographical collections. In 
certain respects, it requires us to re-
evaluate the way in which the long-range
 goal of rebirth in the Pure Land 
functions within the lives of Pure Land 
believers. It is easy, but perhaps 
ultimately misleading, to think of Pure 
Land spirituality as having a morbid 
obsession with death and the afterlife 
just because its stated aim is rebirth 
in Sukhavati. This is especially so if 
we are to take (Masters) Zunshi and 
Shandao (Shan tao) seriously when they 
<pb n="208"/>
claim that sustained practice of nienfo 
(Buddha Recitation) will bring a vision 
of the Buddha in this very life. In 
effect, such a vision of Amitabha does 
more than confirm that one is destined 
for the Pure Land in the near future, 
for it implies that one already has 
access to the Buddha now. Thus it 
becomes a mark of sainthood that is 
virtually equivalent (in anticipated 
form) to the irreversibility on the 
Bodhisattva path that will formally be 
achieved when one is reborn in the Pure 
Land itself. In this respect, it 
represents a kind of Pure Land '
Enlightenment' experience that is 
equally compelling and equally vital to 
establishing religious identity and 
authority as the 'seeing into one's 
original nature' of Chan (Zen)."

inherent Buddha-nature. 'Outflows' are 
so called because they are turnings of 
energy and attention outward rather than
 inward. 'Outflows' are ended by the 
practice of the
"Three Non-Outflow Study', i.e., 
morality, samadhi, and wisdom."
"With outflows: leaking, i.e., worldly, 
mundane or conditioned, inside the 
passion-stream. Without outflows: 
without leakage, transcendental or 
unconditioned, outside the passion-
stream." 
NOTE: 
Conditioned merits and virtues (or 
Merits and Virtues "with outflows") lead
 to rebirth within Samsara, whereas 
unconditioned merits and virtues are the
 cause of liberation from Birth and 
Death. Single-minded Buddha Recitation 
leads to merit "without outflows". 



<xa>OVEREATING</xa>
<_-xa>Vegetarianism</_-xa>; <_-xa>Food /

"There is much to be said for a simple 
diet. Most people overeat, and Seneca's 
<pb n="210"/>
observation that men do not die 
naturally but kill themselves with their
 knives and forks is as true today as it
 was in his time. No one who is troubled
 by indigestion, chronic constipation, 
and kindred ills resulting from eating 
too much or eating too-rich foods can 
carry on Zen practice effectively. 
Especially if one has a sedentary job, 
exercises little, and meditates long, to
 eat little is better than to eat much. 
A sparse diet helps Zen meditation in 
yet another way, by muting sexual desire
 and the fantasies that it spawns. In 
fact, during the deepest states of 
samadhi the body requires little or no 
food but seems to extract a different 
kind of nourishment from the atmosphere.

普陀山
Mountain in Chekiang Province, south of 
Shanghai, China. It is traditionally 
believed that the Bodhisattva 
Avalokitesvara attained Nirvana there. 
This belief is based on the Avatamsaka 
Sutra which refers to a mythical island 
of Avalokitesvara named Potalaka. 
"One of the mountains in the Chou-shan 
Islands, located in Che-chiang Province,
 China. It prospered as a center of 
Avalokitesvara workship. There are more 
than 200 temple buildings in the 
Buddhist complex there. Along with Wu-t'
ai-shan and E-mei-shan, it is one of the
 four famous mountains in China." 
"The island of P'u T'o, known as P'u T'o
 Shan (P'u T'o Mountain), rises sharply 
and dramatically out of the East China 
Sea, one amongst a number of small 
islands in the Chusan Archipelago, 70 
miles from Ningpo. The natural beauty of
 the island has long been recognized, 
for its original name was Hsiao Pai Hua 
Shan, the Small White Flower Mountain...
 The island has been a holy or sacred 
place for at least 2,000 years, for it 
<pb n="212"/>
was originally a Taoist sacred mountain,
 and one of its other names, lasting 
throughout most of the T'ang dynasty 
until the fame of Kuan Yin overcame it, 
was Mei Tsen Shan, after a lst century B
.C. Taoist Alchemist Mei Fu who 
retreated to the island to practice his 
alchemical skills... T h e significance 
of P'u T'o Shan is that it is believed 
to be none other than the mystical 
island of Kuan Yin, Potalaka, which is 
described in the Avatamsaka Sutra." 



<xa>PADMASAMBHAVA</xa>
"(8th century.) Tantric Saint 
instrumental in introducing Buddhism to 
Tibet. He is regarded by the Nyingmapa 
order as their founder...The Tibetan 
King Trisong Detsen (740-98) had invited
 the scholar Shantarakshita to Tibet, 
where he disseminated Buddhism and 
inspired the founding of the first 
Buddhist monastery at Samye. The king 
then invited Padmasambhava to exorcise 
the local demons and gods who resisted 
the teachings (Dharma). He did so, 
making them protectors of the Dharma, a 
story which illustrates how Buddhism 
<pb n="213"/>
incorporated local Tibetan traditions.
The two figures of Shantarakshita and 
Padmasambhava exemplify two strands of 
Buddhism in Tibet, the one centred on 
the celibate, monastic discipline, the 
other centred on the Tantric traditions 
of magical power (siddhi) and exorcism."

Vn/ To Ba-Truong. "Famous Chinese Ch'an 
master, known not only for the 
importance of his meditational 
attainment, but also for his rules 
regulating monastic behavior. Pai-chang 
was the Dharma heir of Ma-tsu Tao-i and 
the master of the well known disciple 
Kuei-shan Ling-yu, founder of one of the
 'five houses' of Ch'an Buddhism. Prior 
to Pai-chang's rules, monks in China 
followed the Vinaya of the 
Dharmaguptakas, an Indian Buddhist 
school. Pai-Chang's system utilized the 
Vinaya emphasis of both Theravada and 
Mahayana in structuring a framework 
uniquely adapted to Chinese monastic 
<pb n="214"/>
life. He is also known for his emphasis 
on monks establishing their own support 
through working in the fields. While he 
maintained the alms rounds as a form of 
meditational training, he advocated the 
notion that 'a day without work is a day
 without food.'"

"Successor to Ma-zu Dao-Yi (Ma-Tsu Tao-I
). Though both Masters are known for 
their seemingly eccentric behavior quite
 typical of Chan adepts in the Tang, 
they were both strict disciplinarians. 
Their apparently 'uncouth' gestures were
 (believed) necessary to drive away 
dualistic views held by their disciples 
and visitors."

"Pai Chang was the first to lay out a 
clearly formulated set of rules for Zen 
monks ... Drawing on the traditions of .
.. vinaya (monastic discipline), Pai 
Chang created a new set of rules adapted
 to Zen ... The Pure Rules of Pai Chang 
included the basic Buddhist commandments
 ... as well as additional injunctions 
against luxury ... Both the lifestyle 
that Pai-Chang spelled out as well as 
the architectural form of his monastery 
became models for later Zen monasteries.
<pb n="215"/>
 The service he rendered the monastic 
community life of Zen earned him the 
epithet, 'the patriarch who created the 
forest.'" (H. Dumoulin, Zen Buddhism:170
.)

Pure Land and Zen
"Elder Zen Master Pai Chang of Huai Hai 
(one of the most famous Zen Masters of 
all time) was the direct descendant to 
the great Zen Master Ma Tsu of Chiang 
Hsi. Zen communities throughout the 
world are established on his model and 
have adopted his 'Pure Rules'. Since 
ancient times, no one has dared to 
criticize or violate this set of rules. 
According to these Rules, prayers for 
the benefit of seriously ill monks and 
nuns must include the following passage:
 'The fourfold assembly should gather 
together, and all should recite verses 
of praise to Amitabha Buddha and chant 
his name from one hundred to one 
thousand times. At the end, the 
following words of transference should 
be read: 'If conditions have not yet 
come to an end, let him quickly recover.
 If the time of death has arrived, we 
pray that he will be reborn in the Pure 
Land.' Is this not pointing the way back
<pb n="216"/>
 to the Pure Land? 
Moreover, the liturgy for sending off 
deceased monks includes this passage: '
the great assembly should all recite the
 name of Amitabha Buddha in unison, 
transferring the merits and making the 
following vow: "Let his soul be reborn 
in the Pure Land, his Karma in the world
 of dust severed; let him be reborn in 
the upper lotus grade, with a golden 
body. May he also receive a prediction 
of Buddhahood in one lifetime.' 'Is this
 not pointing the way back to the Pure 
Land? Furthermore, at the time of burial
 or cremation, the 'Pure Rules' 
stipulate: The monk in charge of the 
service should lead the way, striking a 
small bell, and recite the name of 
Amitabha Buddha ten times, with the 
great assembly following in unison. 
After recitation, the following words of
 transference should be read: 'We have 
just intoned the Buddha's name ten times
 to assist in rebirth ...' Is this not 
pointing the way back to the Pure Land? 
It is for these reasons that this old 
monk said, 'Zen Masters the world over 
all set their Minds on the Pure Land."'

Once the Chinese Emperor Mu Chung of the
 Tang dynasty, impressed by the level of
 cultivation of National Master Wu Yeh 
invited him to come for an audience. To 
just about any subject, this would have 
been an overwhelming honor. However, the
<pb n="221"/>
 master kept refusing because he did not
 want to be disturbed by wordly matters.
 So the emperor told his envoy, "If you 
cannot persuade Master Wu Yeh to come, 
you will have to forfeit your life." The
 envoy sought out the master and 
tearfully asked for his cooperation. The
 monk, unable to refuse the request at 
this point, said, "All right, I will go.
" So he gathered the whole assembly and 
asked his followers, "Who would like to 
join me for an audience with the emperor
?" When a disciple raised his hand, the 
master asked, "How many miles can you 
travel in one day?" The disciple 
answered, "Fifty." The monk said, "That'
s not good enough". A second disciple 
was asked the same question and said, "
Sixty-five," to which the monk replied 
again, "That's not good enough." A third
 disciple said, "Seventy miles," and for
 the third time, the monk said, "That's 
not good enough." Then a young monk 
raised his hand and said, "I will go 
wherever you go, Master." So the Master 
did his ablutions, then went back and 
sat on his elevated seat, entered 
Samadhi and expired on the spot, in a 
seated position. The young monk, seeing 
that, said, Oh, Master, you have gone.

In days of yore, an older master was 
traveling along a country road, followed
 by a disciple carrying his bags. As 
they walked, they saw lands being tilled
 while farmers and oxen were strained to
 the utmost. Countless worms and insects
 were killed in the process, and birds 
were swooping to eat them. This led the 
disciple to wonder to himself, "How hard
 it is to make a living. I will 
cultivate with all my strength; become a
 Buddha and save all these creatures." 
Immediately the Master, an Arhat able to
 read the thoughts of others, turned 
around and said, "Let me have those 
heavy bags and I will follow you." The 
disciple was puzzled but did as 
instructed and walked in front. As they 
continued on their way with the hot sun 
bearing down on them, dust swirling all 
<pb n="223"/>
around them, the road stretching 
endlessly in front, the disciple grew

before he thought to himself, "There are
 so many sentient beings and there is so
 much suffering, how can I possibly help
 them all? Perhaps I should try to help 
myself first." Immediately, the Master 
behind him said, "Stop. Now you carry 
the bags and follow me." The puzzled 
disciple did as told, knowing he was not
 supposed to ask questions. He took up 
the bags again and walked behind. This 
sequence repeated itself several times. 
The Master walked in front with the 
disciple carrying the bags, then the 
disciple in front with the Master 
carrying the bags, back and forth, until
 they stopped for lunch. Then the 
disciple gathered his courage and asked 
the reason why. The Master said, "When 
you had exalted thoughts of saving all 
sentient beings, you had the mind of a 
Bodhisattva, and I as an Arhat had to 
follow you. But as soon as you had 
selfish thoughts, you were no longer a 
Bodhisattva, and being junior to me in 
years and cultivation, you had to carry 
my bags."

 though the Buddha discouraged all 
display of miraculous or 
parapsychological powers as offering 
proof of spiritual attainment. He was 
first and foremost a pragmatist, a 
patient compassionate pragmatist. 
A story that is told of his response to 
a noted ascetic whose path he crossed on
 one of his journeys nicely illustrates 
his down-to-earth reaction to any 
extremes of yogic behavior. Encountering
 an ascetic ... at a river crossing, he 
entered into conversation as he often 
did when traveling, and was told that 
the ascetic had achieved such mastery 
over his physical body that he could now
 cross the river walking on the water. 
The Buddha's comment was to the effect 
that such a feat, though remarkable, 
seemed a rather useless expenditure of 
physical and psychological energy, since
 there was a good ferry crossing the 
river at regular intervals charging less
 than a penny for the ride." For another
 version of this parable, see below."

waiting at the river's edge for a boat

by, showed off his spiritual powers, 
crossing the river back and forth by 
treading over the water. The Buddha had 
then asked him, "How long did it take 
you to acquire such powers?"
"Thirty years," was the reply. The 
Buddha then said, "Thirty y ears of 
effort? Well, I can cross the river for 
a five-cent fare." It may be added that 
for a person still subject to excessive

access to unusual powers could be 
harmful to himself and dangerous to

 universe. Every day they take on a 
different role with a different set of 
duties and obligations -- as mothers or 
fathers, sons or daughters, employees or
 employers etc. However, in all these 
roles, the common denominator of change 
and loss is ever present: loss of loved 
ones, loss of cherished property, loss

of health and youth until the biggest 
loss of all -- we ourselves are carried 
to our graves and have to leave 
everything behind...How do we escape 
from this vicious cycle? Just walk out

Question: Life cannot be all suffering.

analogy of the six sense organs, the six

The man proceeding on the path towards

Although I have seemingly abandoned all

Thereupon she went home and, from that

Bodhisattva in his progress to 
Buddhahood. They include the practice 
and highest possible development of 
charity, morality, forbearance, zeal, 
meditation and wisdom. The following 
four are sometimes added: skillful means
 of teaching, power over obstacles, 
spiritual aspiration, and knowledge, 
<pb n="251"/>
these last four being, however, regarded
 as amplifications of Prajna, or wisdom.
"

"Dana pararnita (charity) consists of 
beneficence and giving in both the 
material and spiritual senses. This 
includes being compassionate and kind 
and not keeping accumulated merit for 
oneself but rather dedicating it to the 
liberation of all beings.
Shila-paramita (discipline) includes 
proper behavior conductive to the 
eradication of all passions and the 
securing of a favorable rebirth for the 
sake of liberating all beings. Kshanti 
paramita (forbearance) refers to the 
patience and tolerance that arise from 
the insight that all the problems of 
beings have causes. Virya paramita (zeal
) is resolute effort that does not 
permit itself to be diverted by anything
. Dhyana paramita (concentration) here 
means meditation as (a) way of cutting 
through the illusion of an ego and of 
not experiencing oneself as separate 
from other beings. Prajna-paramita(
wisdom) is the realization of supreme 
wisdom."

<pb n="252"/>
Background
"The paramitas constitute an important 
teaching of the Prajnaparamita Sutras, 
of which the Diamond and the Heart 
Sutras are summaries. See the following 
passage: 'Since that which is real 
includes nothing worth begrudging, they 
(Bodhisattvas) give their body, life, 
and properly in charity, without regret,
 without the vanity of giver, gift or 
recipient, and without bias or 
attachment ... And as with charity, they
 also Practice the other virtues. But 
while practicing the six virtues (
paramitas) to eliminate delusion, they 
practice nothing at all. This is what's 
meant by practicing the Dharma.' ('
Outline of practice' in Red Pine, tr., 
The Zen Teaching of Bodhidharma, p. 7.)"
 
There is no distinction between oneself 
and other beings, between the savior and
 the saved because at the supramundane 
level of the Arhats and above, the ego 
has been transcended. It is just like 
one's two hands. Because they belong to 
the same person, one would automatically
 clasp the other if hurt and neither 
would hold a grudge against the other 
for accidentally striking it (when 
<pb n="253"/>
missing the head of a nail, for example)
.

"Translated as perfect quietude. 
Although this term originally had the 
same meaning as Nirvana and referred to

indicate Buddha Sakyamuni's entering the
 state of Nirvana (i.e. death)."

"The Maha-Parinirvana Sutra is the 
Sanskrit title of a Mahayana text which 
translates to 'The Discourse of the 
Great Parinirvana.' Not to be confused 
<pb n="255"/>
with the Pali text similarly titled (
Parinibbana Sutta, q.v.), the Mahayana 
text expounds on the Buddha-nature as 
equivalent to the Dharma-kaya and being 
immanent in all sentient beings. Other 
traditional Mahayana ideas can be found 
in the text as well. It is an enormously
 lengthy text, far exceeding its Pali 
counterpart." 
"The Parinirvana Sutra refers to Either 
of the two Chinese versions of the 
Mahayana Nirvana Sutra: the northern 
version translated by Dharmakshema 
during the Northern Liang dynasty (AD 
423), and the southern translated by Hui
-kuan, Hui-yen, and Hsieh Ling-yun 
during the Liu Sung dynasty. The latter 
is a revised version of the former. Both
 deal with teachings that Sakyamuni is 
said to have expounded immediately 
before his death. The (Parinirvana) 
Sutra teaches that the Dharma body of 
the Buddha is eternal, that all people 
possess the Buddha nature, and that even
 those of incorrigible disbelief (
Sanskrit: icchantika) can attain 
Buddhahood. It also contains the stories
 of Sakyamuni Buddha who as a 
Boddhisattva offered his body to a demon
 in exchange for the Dharma, and of 
<pb n="256"/>
Ajatashatru, who put his father to death
 but later repented and became the

NOTE:
"The Chinese Tripitaka contains three

<xa>PARITTA</xa>
<_-xa>護身咒</_-xa>
<_-xa>Angulimala Paritta</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Mantra咒</_-xa>

Pali, lit. "protection."; a Dharani, a 
mantra.
"The modern explanation of the meaning 
of paritta recital (as producing mental 
well-being) contrasts with the widely 
held belief among lay people in the 
efficacy of paritta chant to bring about
 particular ends, such as curing 
physical illness. Even in the Pali texts
 themselves, the Buddha is said to have 
approved chanting the Karaniya Metta 
<pb n="257"/>
Sutta to ward off evil spirits, and the 
Angulimala Paritta was specifically 
sanctioned for a difficult childbirth." 
"Such chanting is especially common in 
the form of 'protection' (parita) 
discourses. The practice is mentioned 
only rarely in the Pali Canon and always
 in contexts of healing and protection. 
There is a recognized manual of such 
discourses, selected from the more awe-
inspiring and potent contexts. At some 
point (we do not know when) many new 
Pali verses and formulae were added in 
order to create a complex set of 
recognized forms for ritual purposes. 
Indeed its strong ritual component has 
been a major factor in the growth and 
success of Southern Buddhism. Together 
with other merit-making activities the 
chanting of Pali discourses accompanies 
ceremonial occasions of many kinds, 
including some of the major events of 
the individual life-cycle. There are 
also many traditional ceremonies in 
which specifically Buddhist ritual plays
 little part. Chanting paritta comes 
into its own, however, with events which
 are in some way dangerous or 
potentially so: death, illness, 
possession .. embarking upon some new 
<pb n="258"/>
activity or entering a new house. It may
 take place on quite a small scale, but 
often there is an impressive and 
colourful ceremonial context, involving 
a great deal of careful preparation, all
 of which is, of course, also 
meritorious activity."

Patriarchal Zen. Known today simply as "
Zen", stresses the immediate 
enlightenment of the practitioner.
"The school deriving from Hui-neng, the 
sixth patriarch of Chinese Ch'an (Jpn/ 
Zen). His master was Hung-jen, the fifth
 patriarch. Hung-jen had another able 
disciple called Shen-hsiu who spread Zen
 in northern China and started what came
 to be called the Northern school of Zen
. Although the Northern school soon 
declined, the Southern was divided into 
five branches--Ts'ao-tung (Soto), Yun-
men (Ummon), Fa-yen (Hogen), Kuei-yang (
igyo) and Lin-chi (Rinzai). The Lin-chi 
school eventually produced two more 
schools, Huang-ling (Oryu) and Yang-chi 
(Yogi)."

"The Zen School of China and Japan 
claims a line of twenty-eight Indian 
Patriarchs beginning with the Buddha 
himself and passing through many famous 
names, such as Asvaghosha, Nagarjuna and
 Vasubandhu to Bodhidharma of India, who
 was the twenty-eighth Indian and first 
Chinese Zen Patriarch. The six ... 
<pb n="261"/>
Patriarchs (in China) were (1) 
Bodhidharma (Ch./ Tamo, Jpn./ Daruma) 
who reached China in 520, (2) Hui-k'o (
Jpn./ Eka) 486-593, (3) Seng-t'san (Jpn.
/ Sosan) died 606, (4) Tao-hsin (Jpn./ 
Doshin) 579-651, (5) Hung-jen (Jpn./ 
Gunin) 601-675, and (6) Hui-neng (Jpn./ 
Eno or Yeno) 637-713, who left no 
successor as Patriarch." 
NOTES
i. At the time of the Sixth Patriarch 
Hui-neng (7th c.), there were two 
branches of Zen, the Northern (Tathagata
) and the Southern (Patriarchal). 
However, the only remaining branch today
 is Patriarchal Zen, which has become 
synonymous with Zen. 
ii. The two approaches to meditation; 
the Sudden (Patriarchal Zen, or simply 
Zen) and the Gradual (Tathagata Zen) 
represent different facets of the same 
teaching adapted to different types of 
people in different locations. To praise
 one approach while disparaging the 
other is therefore a form of attachment,
 a dualistic view of Buddhism not 
consonant with the Truth.

-Lac-Tap. "A work by Tao-Ch'o, the 
second patriarch of the Pure Land school
 (T'ang dynasty). In this work, based on
 the Meditation Sutra, he divides all of
 Shakyamuni's teachings into the two 
categories of Sacred Way teachings and 
Pure Land teachings. He asserts that the
 people of the Latter Day of the Law (
Dharma-ending age) should embrace only 
Pure Land teachings and rely upon 
Amitabha Buddha in order to be reborn in
 his Pure Land in the western region of 
the universe. He also makes reference to
 the difficult-to-practice way and the 
easy-to-practice way set forth by 
Nagarjuna. He recommends abandoning the 
difficult-to-practice way, or the Sacred
 Way, which teaches the attainment of 
Buddhahood in this world through one's 
own power, and embracing the easy-to-
practice way, that is, Pure Land 
teachings which lead one to rebirth in 
the Pure Land by relying upon Amitabha 
Buddha. This work formed the basis of

<xa>PERFECT</xa>
<_-xa>Perfect Teaching</_-xa>; <_-xa>Sudden
 Teaching</_-xa>; <_-xa>Provisional 
Teaching</_-xa>; <_-xa>Special Teaching</_-xa>

"Perfect (i.e. highest) and sudden (
immediate). The state of enlightenment 
aimed at by the T'ien T'ai (Tendai) (and
 Avatamsaka schools)."

I. Perfect teaching
Supreme teaching of the Buddhas, as 
expressed in the Lotus and Avatamsaka 
Sutras, among others. Expounds the One-
Vehicle or the Vehicle of the Buddhas.

"Sometimes called the round teaching. 
The supreme teaching of Buddhism. In 
China, scholars made numerous attempts 
to organize the vast array of sutras 
which had been introduced at random from
 India into coherent systems. In these 
systems of comparative classification, 
as they were called, the sutra which was
 ranked highest was called the perfect 
<pb n="264"/>
teaching. For example, Hui-kuang (468-
537) divided Buddhist teachings into 
three categories -- gradual, abrupt and 
perfect -- and designated the Avatamsaka
 Sutra as the perfect teaching. T'ien-t'
ai declared the doctrine of the mutually
 inclusive relationship of ultimate 
reality of all phenomena to be the 
perfect teaching." 
II. Sudden Teaching 
A teaching which enables one to attain 
Enlightenment immediately. It is usually
 associated with the Avatamsaka and/or 
Zen schools.
'The Sudden teaching expounds the abrupt
 realization of the ultimate truth 
without relying upon verbal explanations
 or progression through various stages 
of practice."
III. Pure Land Teaching
"In his commentary on the Pure Land 
sutras, (Patriarch) Chu-hung classifies 
Pure Land as a sudden (abrupt) doctrine 
that also shares some aspects of the '
final' doctrine of the Lotus Sutra and 
the perfect (round) doctrine of the 
Avatamsaka Sutra. It belongs to the 
sudden doctrine, he says, because the 
Pure Land devotee 'attains rebirth in 
the Western Paradise as soon as he 
<pb n="265"/>
relies on the Buddha's name.'
Chu-hung explains that the mind of the 
devotee of Buddha-recitation, when this 
is properly done, is a mind without any 
disturbance and is equivalent to the 
mind of no-thought spoken of in the Zen 
school. Like Han-shan, Chu-hung 
interprets Pure Land teaching in the Zen
 spirit, but at the same time advocates 
the more traditional and devotional 
aspects of the Pure Land faith. For both
 men, the other-power religion that 
teaches salvation by faith and Amitabha'
s grace is wedded to the self-power 
religion that teaches salvation by self 
realization." 
NOTE:
"These days many people like to talk 
about studying enlightenment and finally
 transcend birth and death. They do not 
realize that in this world complete 
enlightenment is extremely difficult. 
They think of it as direct, sudden, '
vertical' transcendence of the Triple 
World of Desire, Form, and Formless 
states. But even someone who has 
overcome desire and reached the stage of
 a 'once-returner' still has to go to 
his death and come back once more 
through rebirth: how much the more so, 
<pb n="266"/>
for an ordinary person! Most of the 
sentient beings in this world will have 
to be reborn in the Pure Land first 
before they can be completely 
enlightened. The Pure Land gate to the 
West is called 'horizontal' 
transcendence: not one in ten thousand 
misses it." (Master Chu Hung in Pure 
Land Pure Mind)

 health probably affected by the 
longevity potions which he had been 
taking, and the imperial scepter was 
taken up by Hsuan-tsung, who immediately
 initiated action to call off the anti-
Buddhist movement. 
To start with, the Taoists, Chao Kuei-
chen and Liu Hsuan-ching, along with 
eleven others, were executed because 
they had incited the previous emperor to
 extreme measures. Imperial permission 
was then given to increase the number of
 temples in the capital from four to 
twelve; each prefecture was also

gentry to the peasants. The following 
story illustrates the need for practice 
(cultivation) in Buddhist teaching (vs. 
study and scholarship for their own sake
).

One day, Po Chu-I, passing along a road,
 saw a Zen monk seated on a tree branch 
preaching the Dharma. The following 
dialogue ensued:

Po Chu-I: 'Old man, what are you doing 
in that tree, in such a precarious 
position? One misstep, and you will fall
 to your death!' 
<pb n="274"/>
Monk: 'I dare say, Your Lordship, that 
your own position is even more 
precarious. If I make a misstep, I alone
 may be killed; if you make a misstep, 
it can cost the lives of thousands.' 
Po Chu-I: "Not a bad reply. I'll tell 
you what. If you can explain the essence
 of Buddhism to me in one sentence, I'll
 become your disciple. Otherwise, we 
will go our separate ways, never to meet
 again.' 
Monk: 'What an easy question! Listen! 
The essence of Buddhism is to do no evil
, do what is good, and keep your Mind 
pure.' Po Chu-I: 'Is that all there is 
to it? Even a child of three realizes 
that!' 
Monk: 'True, a child of three may 
realize it, but it is not sure that a 
man of eighty can practice it!' Buddhism
 is Mind, Buddhism is Practice -- it is

-yin Hui-yuan)" 
"A scholar who studies and 'teaches' a 
sutra with the intent of footnoting and 
categorizing it, instead of practicing 
it, is like a starving man who, given 
food, puts it under a microscope instead
 of eating it, and who teaches others to
 starve along with him." 

In Buddhism, regardless of the school 
followed, practice (cultivation) is a 
must. A buddhist who merely studies or 
lectures on the Buddha's teaching while 
failing to put it into practice has been
 likened to a sick doctor who prescribes
 medicines for others while refusing to 
take any himself. According to Buddhist 
teachings, we all have within us varying
 degrees of greed, anger and delusion. 
To practice is to avoid or mitigate the 
conditions that promote greed, anger and
 delusion. Thus, for example, whenever 
<pb n="280"/>
anger flares up, one's thoughts should 
be redirected, as a form of displacement
, toward the Buddha through Buddha-
remembrance (Buddha Recitation). 

The cardinal rule of all Buddhist 
cultivation, regardless of tradition or 
school, is introspection -looking at our
 own mistakes and correcting them. To 
look at other people's shortcomings and 
criticize them is bound to disturb the 
mind and keep us in a perpetual state of
 anger and frustration.

"In principle, all canonical texts are 
able to satisfy the spiritual needs of 
all Buddhists, whether Eastern or 
Western, but, in Practice some texts 
appeal more strongly to Buddhists of one
 kind of temperament, or one kind of 
spiritual aspiration, than they do to 
those of another. This is the main 
reason for the vast extent of the 
canonical literature, which may be 
regarded as one and the same Dharma in 
varying degrees of expansion and 
contraction, concentration and dilution,
 rather than as a collection of separate
 teachings. The canonical literature is 
like a pharmacopoeia. All the different 
<pb n="281"/>
drugs and medicinal preparations which 
are listed in the pharmacopoeia have one
 and the same object, the restoration of
 a sick person to health, but some drugs
 and medicinal preparations are suited 
to the cure of one kind of disease and 
some to the cure of another. 

The sick person does not have to swallow
 the entire contents of the 
pharmacopoeia. In the same way, it is 
not necessary for the individual Western
 Buddhist, any more than for the 
individual Eastern Buddhist, to study 
and put into Practice the entire 
contents of the Buddhist canonical 
literature. What he has to do is find 
out which canonical text, or which 
collection or selection of texts, is 
best suited to his individual spiritual 
needs, and then devote himself to the 
concentrated and intensive practice of 
the teachings contained in those texts -
- of course, without any diminution of 
his reverence for the canonical 
literature as a whole." (The Eternal 
Legacy)

"In order to demonstrate clearly what 
true cultivation and the personality of 
<pb n="282"/>
the true cultivator are, I will quote a 
passage from the No-Mark Stanza of the 
Platform Sutra, by the Sixth Patriarch: 
He who treads the Path in earnest/Sees 
not the mistakes of the world;/If we 
find fault with others/We ourselves are 
also in the wrong./When other people are
 in the wrong,/we should ignore it,/For 
it is wrong for us to find fault./By 
getting rid of the habit of fault-
finding/We cut off a source of 
defilement./When neither hatred nor love
 disturbs our mind/Serenely we sleep. (
Wong Mou-Lam, tr. 'The Sutra of Hui Neng
,' p. 34. In The Diamond Sutra ＆ The 
Sutra of Hui Neng. )

Buddhist adherents, whether clergy or 
laymen, all consider themselves 
cultivators, concerned with the Way. 
However, how can we tell the genuine 
from the sham cultivator? On this issue,
 the Sixth Patriarch has advanced a 
simple criterion. He said: He who treads
 the Path in earnest sees not the 
mistakes of the world. In effect, the 
genuine cultivator always looks at 
himself to correct his own mistakes and 
dwells in empty, still meditation. 
Having severed the mind of 
<pb n="283"/>
discrimination between himself and 
others, how can he think about the good 
and bad points of others? With the sham 
cultivator, on the other hand, the mind 
of self and others, right and wrong, 
jealousy and hate runs rampant; as soon 
as he opens his mouth, he criticizes 
others and speaks of the good and bad 
points of the world. This is very far 
from the Way. Therefore, when we 
continue to see the mistakes of others, 
denigrating and slandering them, we 
demonstrate that we are the most awkward
 and wanting of all, because our minds 
are still deluded, full of 
discrimination, lacking in wisdom and 
compassion. We thus bring retribution 
upon ourselves in the future. Regardless
 of whether or not others are in the 
wrong, let us strive not to be in the 
wrong ourselves. We should learn from 
great men and let our minds be as clear 
and bright as a mirror. Without 
anticipating or hedging about future 
events, without regretting or dreaming 
about things of the past, with the mind 
filled with brightness and equanimity, 
we will surely receive a wonderful 
response! If we have distracting 
thoughts of envy and hate and speak 
<pb n="284"/>
words of scorn and blame, then, 
internally, our True Nature becomes 
defiled and externally, we bring rancor 
and disputes upon ourselves. This 
results in further errors and 
transgressions. For this reason, to 
achieve peace of mind and be free of 
afflictions, we should not comment on 
people's shortcomings. The phrase 'by 
getting rid of the habit of faultfinding
' also has the deeper meaning of 
eliminating the Four Propositions and 
eradicating the One Hundred Errors. 

'When neither hatred nor love disturbs 
our mind, serenely we sleep'... 
describes the state of great liberation,
 'all eagerness for study gone, eating 
when hungry, sleeping when tired'. True 
cultivators always have a clear and 
solid position and viewpoint, and pay no
 attention to the praise and criticism, 
likes and dislikes of the outside world.
 As an example, it once happened that a 
well-known Zen Master, having awakened 
to the Way under Elder Master Fu Shan, 
went to reside in a famous monastery. 
Although living among the Great Assembly
, he did not Practice meditation or seek
 guidance in the Dharma; all he did all 
<pb n="285"/>
day was lay sleeping. Upon hearing this,
 the abbot arrived at the meditation 
hall, a big staff in hand. Seeing the 
guest master reclining with eyes closed,
 he admonished: 'This place does not 
have surplus rice to allow you to do 
nothing but eat and rest!' Reply: 'What 
would you, High Master, advise me to do?
' The abbot said: 'Why don't you sit in 
meditation?' Answer: 'Succulent food 
cannot tempt those who have eaten their 
fill.' The abbot continued, 'A great 
many people are unhappy with you.' 
Answer: 'If they were happy, what would 
I gain?' Hearing these unusual replies, 
the abbot inquired further, 'Who was 
your master?' Answer: 'I arrived here 
after having studied under the eminent 
Master Fu Shan.' The abbot said, 'No 
wonder you are so headstrong!' They then
 clasped hands, laughing aloud, and 
headed toward the abbot's
quarters.

One day, many years later, the guest Zen
 Master, having washed himself, ascended
 the Dharma seat, bid farewell to the 
great assembly, wrote a parting stanza, 
immediately dropped the pen and expired 
in a seated position. The guest master, 
<pb n="286"/>
as we can see, conducted himself easily 
and freely, having mastered life and 
death. Is it not because he had truly 
internalized the meaning of the passage 
'when neither hatred nor love disturbs 
our mind, serenely we sleep?"' 

Pure Land Buddhism
"The ancients have also commented: Among
 Dharma methods (Buddhist schools),/ 
Pure Land is the shortcut for attaining 
the Way;/ Within Pure Land,/ Oral 
Invocation is the shortcut. Nowadays, 
this method (Oral Invocation) is the 
most popular form of Buddha Recitation."
 

"The practitioner should singlemindedly 
put his faith in the Buddha and 
cultivate with purity throughout his 
life. Whether seated or reclining, he 
should face west. Whenever he bows to 
the Buddha, recites the Buddha's name or
 makes a vow, he should do so in extreme
 earnestness, without intruding, sundry 
thoughts. He should act as though he 
were on the verge of execution, or in 
prison, or pursued by enemies, or in 
danger of drowning or being burned alive
. He should singlemindedly seek help, 
<pb n="287"/>
vowing to escape the cycle of danger and
 swiftly attain NonBirth, in order to 
carry on the work of the Triple Jewel, 
repay the Four Great Debts and rescue 
sentient beings. With such an earnest 
mind, his cultivation will not be in 
vain. On the other hand, if his deeds do
 not match his words, his faith is not 
solid, his recitation is haphazard and 
he seeks rebirth in this lazy, lethargic
 manner, it will be difficult for him to
 encounter good spiritual friends at the
 time of death. Dragged away by the 
power of karma, weighed down by pain and
 suffering, he cannot achieve right 
thought. Why is this so? It is because 
present actions are causes, what is 
received at the time of death are 
results. Causes should be true for 
results not to be false, just as an echo
 which reverberates loud and clear comes
 from a loud noise, and a straight 
mirror image requires a straight object.
" (Elder Master T'ien Ju, l4th c.) 

NOTE:
"Whether one enters a monastery or 
prefers to remain in the lay world, 
there can be no progress in 
concentration without a severe reduction
<pb n="288"/>
 in one's involvement in worldly affairs
. Naturally, the external observances of
 the monastic rule are understood to be 
peculiarly propitious to the development
 of mental calm, but in the last 
analysis, it is inner motive and 
personal discipline that count. Thus we 
are counseled at length to be careful 
about the company we keep, recognizing 
the simple fact that an unexamined 
lifestyle, in which we are immersed in 
the materialistic values and behavior of
 worldly friends, will get us nowhere. 
Only frustration and inanity will be the
 result. Shantideva advises us to fight 
shy of those whose values are contrary 
to the Dharma."

versions for monks and nuns. The 
Pratimoksa Sutra is an inventory of 
offenses organized into categories 
classified according to the gravity of 
the offense. It is recited twice monthly
, at the Posadha observance on the new 
moon and full moon, and is employed as a
 device for insuring proper monastic 
discipline. As a ritual liturgy, it 
includes in addition to the categories 
of offenses, a series of verses that 
introduce and conclude the text, an 
introduction (nidana) used to call the 
sangha together and initiate the 
confessional procedure, and an 
interrogatory formula, recited after 
each category of offenses, aimed at 
discovering who was pure and who was not
. In the monks' version, the categories 
of offenses include the (1) Parajika 
dharmas (offenses requiring expulsion 
from the community), (2) Samghavasesa 
dharmas (offenses involving temporary 
exclusion from the sangha while 
undergoing a probationary period), (3) 
undetermined cases involving sexual 
matters, (4) offenses requiring 
expiation and forfeiture, (5) offenses 
requiring simple expiation, (6) 
miscellaneous matters which should be

the sangha were pure in their behavior

<xa>PRATYUTPANNA</xa>
<_-xa>Pure Land Buddhism (summary)</_-xa>

(Vn/ Bat-Chu Tam-Muoi) "The essence of 
this samadhi is that the Buddha is just 
the mind; the mind creates all Buddhas."
 

"The Pratyutpanna samadhi is to be 
performed in isolation. The meditator 
selects and adorns a hall for practice, 
prepares all the necessary accoutrements
 of offering, and lays out various 
delicacies, fruit, incense, and flowers.
 Having washed himself thoroughly, he 
changes into a new set of robes, which 
are to be worn at all times in the inner
 sanctuary where the practice is 
performed. Whenever he leaves this 
chamber to tend to necessities, he 
changes back into an older set. The 
<pb n="294"/>
practice itself lasts for a fixed period
 of ninety days, over the duration of 
which the meditator must continuously 
circumambulate an altar to the Buddha 
Amitabha. He vows never to entertain 
worldly thoughts or desires, never to 
lie down or leave the hall, and, aside 
from the time when he eats his meals, 
never to sit down or stop to rest until 
the three months are completed...The 
devotional element in this practice...
undoubtedly plays a key role; however, 
as the practitioner becomes more skilled
 at constructing the mental image of the
 Buddha, the orientation of the 
visualization begins to shift radically.
 Eventually, the eidetic image of 
Amitabha loses its devotional character 
altogether and instead becomes the basis
 for a simple dialectical investigation 
into the nature of mind and the noetic 
act itself." 

"When practicing this samadhi the 
cultivator has three powers to assist 
him: the power of Amitabha Buddha, the 
power of the samadhi and the power of 
his own virtues. The unit of practice of
 this samadhi should be ninety days. In 
that span of time, day and night the 
<pb n="295"/>
practitioner just stands or walks around
, visualizing Amitabha Buddha appearing 
as a body standing on the practitioner's
 crown, replete with the thirty-two 
auspicious marks and the eighty 
beautiful characteristics. He may also 
recite Amitabha Buddha's name 
continuously, while constantly 
visualizing Him. When practice is 
perfected, the cultivator, in samadhi, 
can see Amitabha Buddha and the Buddhas 
of the ten directions standing in front 
of him, praising and encouraging him. 
Pratyutpanna is also called the '
Constantly Walking Samadhi.' As the 
practitioner walks, each step, each word
 is inseparable from the name of 
Amitabha Buddha. His body, speech and 
mind are always practicing Buddha 
Recitation without interruption, like a 
continuous flow of water. This method 
brings very lofty benefits, but only 
those of high capacity have the 
endurance to practice it. Those of 
limited o: moderate capacities or 
lacking in energy cannot pursue this 
difficult practice." 

NOTE:
"In the Avatamsaka Sutra, the first 
<pb n="296"/>
spiritual advisor of the youth Sudhana (
q.v.) taught him the 'samadhi of 
mindfulness of the Buddha' (i.e. Buddha 
Recitation Samadhi). This was the first 
Dharma taught to Sudhana, for it appeals
 to all beings, whether of deep or 
shallow roots. Specifically, Bhikshu 
Cloud of Virtue, the first guru, 
expounded on the Pratyutpanna samadhi (
Avatamsaka Sutra, ch. 39)."



<xa>PRATYUTPANNA</xa>
<_-xa>Pratyutpanna Samadhi</_-xa>

Ch/Pan-Chou San-Mei Ching; Vn/Bat-Chu 
Tam-Muoi Kinh. "A sutra that somewhat 
bridges the gap between distant and 
immanent Pure Lands. This was first 
translated into Chinese by Lokaksema in 
179 C.E. and can in a sense be regarded 
as the scriptural foundation for Chinese
 Pure Land piety. It recommends 
concentrating the mind on Sukhavati day 
and night for 90 days after which 
Sukhavati will appear before one's eyes.
 The sutra explicitly states that the 
Pure Land will appear here and now and 
that one will not have to die and be 
<pb n="297"/>
reborn there. This method, it states, is
 effective for any Buddha or Buddha-land
 one wishes to see. Putting it quite 
straightforwardly, it says 'if you wish 
to see present Buddhas of the ten 
directions, you should single-mindedly 
direct your thought to where they dwell 
and should not entertain other thoughts.
 Then you will be able to see them.' 
This 'is as if a man gets up at night 
and observes numerous stars.' The reason
 why the meditation works is simple. We 
normally 'consider the worldly things as
 existent and never realize emptiness'; 
that is, as the Vimalakirti Sutra puts 
it, our world is impure because our 
minds are impure. But, when we 
concentrate on reality as it truly is (
emptiness or a Pure Land) then, provided
 that our practice is strong enough, we 
will begin to see reality truly. The (
crucial point), however, is in the 
proviso. The meditation that results in 
seeing the Buddhas and their Pure Lands 
here and now is strenuous and is open 
only to monastics (with a few rather 
grudging exceptions) since it requires 
strict adherence to the Vinaya as well 
as long periods of intense meditation. 
But there is hope for lay people. 'The 
<pb n="298"/>
Buddha (Sakyamuni said), "Bodhisattvas 
in this land can see Amita Buddha by 
single-mindedly visualizing him." Now, 
let it be asked what method of practice 
they should perform in order to be born 
in the Land. Amita Buddha replies, '
Those who desire to be born should 
invoke my name unceasingly; then they 
will attain birth (there).' (
Pratyutpanna Samadhi Sutra) Thus, it 
appears that the Panchou San-Mei ching 
teaches invocation of the Name of Amita 
as a substitute practice for those who 
are unable to become monks or nuns. And 
while invocation will not result in a 
vision during this life, it will bring 
rebirth in the Pure Land after death, 
and that, in the end, is just as 
effective for final liberation. Many 
practitioners apparently decided that, 
by and large, this was good enough, and 
the importance of being a monastic, or 
having one as a teacher (which this 
sutra emphasizes) is, in later Pure Land
 practice, downgraded."

<xa>PRECEPTS</xa>
<_-xa>Five Precepts</_-xa>; <_-xa>Bhiksu</_-xa>; <_-xa>Bhiksuni</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Bodhisattva Precepts</_-xa>

(Skt/Sila) "The rules of conduct and 
discipline established by the Buddha." 

Broadly speaking, Buddhist precepts are 
divided into two categories: the basic 
precepts common to all traditions, 
Theravada or Mahayana; and the 
Bodhisattva Precepts, followed by 
Mahayana practitioners, both monks and 
laymen.

(I) BASIC PRECEPTS
"Throughout the Buddhist traditions, one
<pb n="300"/>
 of the most important tools for the 
formation, continuity, and sense of 
identity of a Buddhist community has 
been precepts. 
a) In addition to taking refuge in the 
Three Jewels, laypeople took up Five 
Precepts: not to kill, not to steal, not
 to engage in sexual misconduct, not to 
lie, and not to use intoxicants. (One 
who observes these precepts is reborn as
 a human being.) 
b) Some laypeople would take Eight 
Precepts which they would maintain (on 
certain special days) each month. These 
were precepts not to kill; steal; engage
 in sexual activity; lie; use 
intoxicants; attend musical performances
/ adorn their bodies; sleep on high and 
wide beds; or eat after noontime. 
c) This same set of precepts, with the 
addition of two i) not to sing, dance/ 
perform onstage and ii) not handle gold 
or silver, constitutes the ten precepts 
of novice monks and nuns. 
d) Fully ordained monks and nuns held 
many more precepts; under one of the 
codes, monks held 250 precepts, nuns 348
. All of these precepts, whether lay or 
monastic, are called Pratimoksa Precepts
, precepts of liberation. These precepts
<pb n="301"/>
 are regarded as the foundation of the 
life of a Buddhist. For laypeople, 
maintaining precepts was a way to 
accumulate virtuous karma ... For monks 
and nuns, precepts were regarded as 
defining monastic identity, a lifestyle 
designed by the Buddha himself as most 
conducive to the pursuit of liberation 
from rebirth. 
It was the maintenance of these precepts
 by monks and nuns that was said to 
justify the alms they received from the 
laity. Hence, perhaps, the most 
important of monastic ceremonies was the
 Uposadha ceremony, in which the monks 
of a given monastery or area gathered 
together to recite the precepts. Prior 
to the ceremony, monks would gather in 
small groups of two or three to confess 
any transgressions of the monastic code 
to each other. The senior monk would 
then recite each of the categories of 
precepts, asking three times at the end 
of each category whether there were any 
transgressions to be revealed. Hearing 
none, because whatever transgressions 
had occurred would already have been 
confessed privately, he declared the 
Sangha to be pure.

<pb n="302"/>
(II) BODHISATTVA PRECEPTS With the rise 
of the various groups that came to be 
called the Mahayana, we find the 
development of more precepts, the 
Bodhisattva Precepts. 
It seems that in the early Mahayana, 
persons publicly took the famous 
Bodhisattva Precepts, promising to 
achieve Buddhahood in order to liberate 
all beings from Samsara. In time, a more
 formal code of conduct was developed, 
derived from a number of sources, with 
categories of root infractions and 
secondary infractions. The Bodhisattva 
Precepts, however, could be taken 
equally by laypeople and monastics, men 
and women. Formal ceremonies for doing 
so are set forth in a number of Mahayana
 treatises. In addition, there (are) 
ceremonies for the confession of 
infractions, modeled on the Uposadha. 
There is a great deal that could be said
 about the content of the Bodhisattva 
Precepts. Some of the precepts have to 
do with interpersonal relations, 
prescribing the kind of altruistic 
behavior that one might expect from a 
Bodhisattva. Others are more grand. 
There is also the suggestion that the 
Bodhisattva Precepts supersede the 
<pb n="303"/>
Pratimoksa Precepts." 

The Bodhisattva Precepts include ten 
major and forty-eight minor precepts. 
These precepts are derived from the 
Three Bodies of Pure Precepts (q.v.).

(III) NOTE
"In Buddhism, there is no cultivation 
without Discipline (precepts), 
Concentration and Wisdom, and also there
 is no Dharma without Discipline, 
Concentration and Wisdom."

(I) PROOFS DURING ONE'S LIFETIME.
"Pure Land followers should strive 
earnestly for a response. The lives of 
sentient beings are ephemeral and easily
 cut short; the ghost of impermanence 
<pb n="305"/>
waits for no one. Your hair is already 
streaked with white, your face has grown
 wrinkled. The marks of decay and old 
age are very clear, and death is but a 
short time away. Therefore, you should 
strive to cultivate in earnest, to 
ensure that some auspicious and reliable
 signs of rebirth appear. Thus, in 
ancient China, Elder Master Hui Yuan of 
Lu Shan saw the Buddha rub his crown 
three times. Another Elder Master 
earnestly recited the Buddha's name and 
immediately saw Amitabha Buddha emit 
rays of light and display auspicious 
marks. In the case of still another 
Elder Master, each time he uttered the 
Buddha's name, the Great Assembly would 
see a Buddha flying out of his mouth. 
This was true for hundreds of thousands 
of his utterances; hundreds of thousands
 of Buddhas escaped from his mouth, like
 so many rosary beads, one after another
. Such responses are countless. If you 
recite Amitabha Buddha's name in earnest
, without interruption, it is very easy 
to see Him. Otherwise, it is very 
difficult. If you do not see the Buddha,
 you do not have affinities with Him. 
Without affinities, it is certainly 
difficult to achieve rebirth in the Pure
<pb n="306"/>
 Land. If you are not reborn in the Pure
 Land, sooner or later you will descend 
into the Evil Realms. Thus, a single 
thought of interrupting recitation is 
precisely the karma of rebirth on the 
Three Evil Paths. You should bear this 
in mind and ponder it carefully! (Master
 Tien Ju)" 

"Although death signs are an important 
and frequent topic of discussion among 
Pure Land believers, it is essential to 
realize that great emphasis is placed on
 confirmatory signs for the living 
practitioner as well. After all, when 
one has decided to devote a lifetime to 
Pure Land practice rather than wait 
until his last breath to turn to 
Amitabha, it is perfectly natural to 
expect some confirmation of spiritual 
progress along the way. Following the 
cue of such Pure Land scriptures as the 
Meditation Sutra, together with various 
other buddhanusmrti sutras popular in 
China, Pure Land practitioners look to 
two sorts of visionary phenomena as 
assurance of their future rebirth in 
Sukhavaii: One is auspicious dreams of 
Amitabha and the Pure Land; the other, 
visitations from Amitabha and previous 
<pb n="307"/>
saints or 'spirit journeys' to the Pure 
Land experienced in a state of samadhi 
or meditative ecstasy. Both forms of 
experience are considered valid proof 
that the 'connection with the pure land'
 would soon be secured -provided, of 
course, that the character and behavior 
of the individual who claimed the 
experience fit the profile of a 
dedicated Pure Land devotee. 
Nevertheless, in Pure Land hagiography 
and doctrine, samadhi is given 
precedence over dreams. The biography of
 nearly every major Pure Land saint -
especially the patriarchal figures -- is
 marked by the watershed experience of a
 vision of this sort. Here we find an 
important point of soteriological 
convergence "between" the Pure Land 
ritual and meditative manuals and the 
Pure Land hagiographical collections. In
 certain respects, this convergence 
requires us to reevaluate the way in 
which the long-range goal of rebirth in 
the Pure Land actually functions within 
the lives of Pure Land believers. It is 
easy, but perhaps ultimately misleading,
 to think of Pure Land spirituality as 
having an obsession with death and the 
afterlife just because its stated aim is
<pb n="308"/>
 rebirth in Sukhavati. This is 
especially so if we are to take Master 
Zunshi and Shandao seriously when they 
taught that sustained practice of nienfo
 (Buddha-Recitation) will bring a vision
 of the Buddha in this very life. In 
effect, such a vision of Amitabha does 
more than confirm that one is destined 
for the Pure Land in the near future, 
for it implies that one already has 
access to the Buddha now. Thus it 
becomes a mark of sainthood that is 
virtually equivalent (in anticipated 
form) to the irreversibility on the 
Bodhisattva path that will be formally 
achieved when one is reborn in the Pure 
Land itself. In this respect, it 
represents a kind of Pure Land '
enlightenment' experience that is 
equally compelling and equally vital to 
establishing religious identity and 
authority as the 'seeing into one's 
original nature' of Chan/Zen."

(II) PROOFS AFTER DEATH
"Among the signs that confirm rebirth in
 the Pure Land, deathbed and mortuary 
anomalies are certainly popular. Some 
involve the dying person, such as 
visions of Amitabha and his retinue 
<pb n="309"/>
coming to greet one with a lotus 
pedestal, as described in the Meditation
 Sutra. An unusually peaceful death (
often while seated erect in a meditative
 posture) or the hearing of marvelous 
strains of music, the smell of rare 
fragrances, or the sight of unusual 
auras on the part of friends and 
relatives are also common features. 
Another variety of post-mortem omen 
centers around the disposition of the 
corpses or the experience of the 
mourners over the weeks of mortuary 
observance that follow. One phenomenon 
that is a universal sign of sainthood or
 high spiritual attainment in Chinese 
Buddhism is the discovery of auspicious 
relics (Skt: sarira) amid the ashes of a
 cremated corpse, usually in the form of
 glassine or jadelike beads. If burial 
is chosen over cremation, natural 
mummification of individual bodily 
organs or the corpse itself will be 
taken as an indication of sanctity. 
Another frequent occurence, but one 
which seems to be more peculiar to Pure 
Land devotees, is the experience of 
visitations from the deceased to 
surviving relatives and friends. Usually
 these occur in dreams and take the form
<pb n="310"/>
 of either a vision of the beatified 
dead person or a 'spirit-journey' with 
the dead person to the Pure Land. Upon 
occasion, however, a layperson or cleric
 of highly developed religious ability 
will have a vision of the deceased while
 in a state of samadhi or meditative 
transport." 

"After someone dies, the people in the 
room perceive a magical fragrance and 
hear celestial music gradually fading 
away toward the west. A golden lotus 
might appear on the death bed or on top 
of the coffin. The dead believer's 
corpse does not decompose. Auspicious 
colored clouds hang over the funeral 
pyre." (J.C. Cleary, tr., Pure land Pure
 Mind.)

 given because it is the custom and 
because it has value. Besides being a

"In Mahayana Buddhism it is believed 
that Buddha Sakyamuni simplified many of
 his teachings, particularly the earlier
 ones, in order that people of various 
capacities could understand them and 
eventually be led to the final doctrine.
 
These simplified teachings are thought 
to have only a provisional nature." 

NOTE: 
Another interpretation is that the 
teachings themselves are not simplified,
 but rather the audience was not ready 
to understand them to the full extent. 
As an analogy, the rain may fall equally
 on big trees and small but the larger 
ones absorb more water. (see Lotus Sutra

Syn: <_-xa>Lifetime Provisions</_-xa>; <_-xa>Life Provisions</_-xa>; <_-xa>Personal

<pb n="313"/>
<_-xa>Rebirth in the Pure Land</_-xa>

In Pure Land terminology, provisions 
stand for Faith, Vows and Practice which
 are considered the personal provisions 
that a Pure Land adept needs to have to 
achieve rebirth in the Pure Land. 

"Faith, Vows and Practice are called the
 'Three Personal Provisions' of the Pure
 Land method. Just as travellers 
embarking on a distant journey must make
 provisions for medicine, food, clothing
 and funds sufficient to cover their 
needs en route, so, too, Pure Land 
practitioners require Faith to make firm
 Vows. However, Faith and Vows are 
hollow without Practice. Likewise, even 
if Practice is adequate, without Faith 
and Vows, that Practice will go astray, 
lacking criteria and direction. 
Therefore, Faith, Vows and Practice are 
the 'provisions' of those returning to 
the Pure Land from afar" (Thich Thien 
Tam, Buddhism of Wisdom and Faith, sect.
 21).

In Buddhism, the sine qua non for 
Enlightenment and Buddhahood is a pure 
mind, that is, a mind totally free of 
greed, anger and delusion. In Pure Land 
Buddhism, the usual terminology is a 
mind of utmost reverence and sincerity, 
leading to one pointedness of mind. This
 is because when the cultivator focusses
 singlemindly on the Amitabha Buddha, he
 cannot harbor thoughts of greed, anger 
<pb n="315"/>
or delusion -- his mind is pure. A pure 
mind is enlightenment -- is the Pure 
Land.

"Develop the Supreme Bodhi Mind ; / 
Achieve singlemindedness; / The Pure 
Land is yours."

(I) Dominant school in East Asia
"(Pure Land comprises the schools) of 
East Asia which emphasize aspects of 
Mahayana Buddhism stressing faith in 
Amida, meditation on and recitation of 
his name, and the religious goal of 
<pb n="316"/>
being reborn in his 'Pure Land,' or '
Western Paradise."' (K. Crim, Perennial 
Dictionary of World Religions.) The goal
 of those devoted to Amitabha and the 
Pure Land is to be reborn there, and 
attain enlightenment (Buddhahood)." 

Pure Land Buddhism chiefly consists in 
hearing and reciting Amitabha Buddha's 
name with a faithful mind, but it does 
not exclude meditation (dhyana) and 
insight (vipasyana) through which one 
can visualise the Buddha. Obviously, 
meditation and insight are mainly 
practiced by monks, particularly by 
gifted persons, while hearing and 
reciting the name with faith are easily 
practiced even by laymen. Exposition of 
the higher practices of Amitabha worship
 first appeared in the Pratyutpanna 
Samadhi Sutra. Later, Vasubandhu 
propounded the contemplation of Amitabha
 by samatha (concentration) practices. 
This, however, does not involve the 
concept of Amitabha as a meditation 
Buddha. (Encyclopedia of Buddhism, V. I:
 p.452)

"Given its popular appeal, (Pure Land) 
quickly became the object of the most 
<pb n="317"/>
dominant form of Buddhist devotion in 
East Asia." M. Eliade, ed., Encyclopedia
 of Religions, Vol.12)."

"The Pure Land school is presently the 
school of Buddhism in China and Japan 
that has the most followers" (Shambhala 
Dictionary of Buddhism and Zen). 

(II) How Pure Land works 
The goal espoused by all Buddhist 
schools is for the practitioner to 
achieve Buddhahood, i.e., to become an '
Enlightened Being.' Thus, to Practice 
Buddhism is to cultivate enlightenment, 
to attain Wisdom. Although there are 
many paths to reach this goal, they all 
involve severing greed, anger and 
delusion, thus perfecting the qualities 
of the Mind (paramitas). Traditionally, 
Buddhist sutras enumerate six or ten 
paramitas, but they may be reduced to 
three: Discipline, Concentration and 
Wisdom (the second, fifth and sixth 
paramitas, respectively). Pure Land, 
symbolized by the Buddha Recitation 
method, is a Mahayana approach that 
employs, inter alia, the techniques of 
meditation visualization (of the Pure 
Land, Amitabha Buddha) and of oral 
<pb n="318"/>
recitation (q.v.) of the Buddha's name, 
to realize these paramitas. That is, 
when a practitioner is busy visualizing 
the Buddha or reciting the Buddha's name
, he cannot commit transgressions or 
violate the Buddhist precepts. Therefore
, he has effectively fulfilled the 
paramita of Discipline. Likewise, 
reciting the Buddha's name with a 
completely focussed Mind is nothing less
 than fulfilling the paramita of 
Concentration. Once Concentration is 
achieved, the practitioner's Mind 
becomes empty and still, leading to the 
emergence of his innate wisdom- the 
Wisdom of the Buddhas. Thus, a sincere 
Buddha Recitation practitioner, by dint 
of his own effort, effectively attains 
Buddhahood. According to Pure Land 
doctrine, however, most practitioners in
 this Degenerate Age find the 'self 
power,' self-help approach too difficult
 and arduous; therefore, in their Pure 
Land teachings, the Buddhas and Sages 
compassionately emphasized the 
additional element of 'other-power.' 
This involves reliance on Amitabha 
Buddha's Vows (q.v.), made countless 
eons ago, to welcome and escort all 
sentient beings to his Land of Ultimate 
<pb n="319"/>
Bliss -- an ideal training ground, an 
ideal environment. To benefit from these
 Vows, the cultivator still needs to do 
his part -- and the easiest practice is 
Buddha Recitation (q.v.). 

"Ultimately, when the practitioner 
recites to the point of pure, unmixed 
power, the totality of Mind is Buddha, 
the totality of Buddha is Mind, Mind and
 Buddha are as one. I am afraid that 
this principle and practice are not 
understood by everyone. It has always 
been my desire to proclaim them and to 
disseminate the Original Vows of 
Amitabha Buddha to rescue all sentient 
beings." (Patriarch Yin Kuang, l9th c.) 

"Some of our readers may be led to think
 that the sole object of the Pure Land 
devotees is to be born in Amida's Land 
of Bliss and Purity ... But the fact is 
that the birth itself ... is not the 
object, but to attain enlightenment in 
the country of Amida where conditions 
are such as to ensure a ready 
realization of the true Buddhist life ..
. If we can say so, to be born in the 
Pure Land is the means to the end; for 
Buddhism in whatever form is a religion 
<pb n="320"/>
of enlightenment and emancipation." (D.T
. Suzuki in The Eastern Buddhist, V. 3, 
no. 4)

(III) Why Pure Land?
"The champions of Pure Land Buddhism 
have always made the case that Pure Land
 methods are especially valuable because
 they are particularly effective in 
meeting the needs of the greatest number
 of people. When we face facts, most of 
us have to admit that we see little 
realistic prospect of achieving 
salvation through the eons of gradual 
practice spoken of in the Buddhist 
scriptures, or the heroic efforts of the
 Zen masters, or the years of esoteric 
dedication demanded by the Esoteric 
Schools. Pure Land practice, on the 
other hand, is explicitly designed as an
 easy way, open to all" (J.C.Cleary). 
Mind-Seal: 3 Traditionally, in Mahayana,
 it is necessary to go through "fifty-
two levels of Bodhisattva practice" (q.v
.) to attain Buddhahood. Even in the 
Sudden School, it is understood that the
 practitioner has already cultivated in 
many past lifetimes and reached one of 
the last levels when he achieves instant
 Enlightenment. In Pure Land, however, 
<pb n="321"/>
the practitioner seeks rebirth in the 
Land of Ultimate Bliss, an ideal 
environment for cultivation, where these
 levels of attainment are compressed. 
Instead of a laborious "vertical" 
struggle, he achieves a direct "
horizontal" escape from the Saha World. 
("Horizontal" and "Vertical" are figures
 of speech, which can readily be 
understood through the example of a worm
 born inside a stalk of a bamboo. To 
escape, it can take the hard way and 
crawl "vertically" all the way to the 
top of the stalk. Alternatively, it can 
poke a hole near its current location 
and escape "horizontally" into the big, 
wide world.) 

NOTE:
"The principal and essential goal of 
Pure Land practice is to achieve rebirth
 in the Pure Land within one lifetime so
 as to reach the stage of Non 
Retrogression (q.v.). This is what sets 
Pure Land apart from other schools and 
gives it its name." (T.T.Tam). To insure
 success, however, the cultivator needs 
to fulfill two crucial conditions: 
develop the Bodhi Mind (q.v.) and 
practice Buddha Recitation to the level 
<pb n="322"/>
of one pointedness of mind (q.v.). 
Seeking auspicious signs of future 
rebirth is also recommended. (See entry 
Proofs of Rebirth in the Pure Land.)

<_-xa>Chiko Mandala</_-xa>; <_-xa>Taima 
Mandala</_-xa>; <_-xa>Raigo</_-xa>

"In the corpus of Jodo painting there is
 a group of works known as mandalas of 
the Pure Land. (Here the term 'mandala' 
has been adapted from its more familiar 
usage in esoteric Buddhist symbolism.) 
The three most celebrated Jodo mandalas 
are the Chiko mandala (q.v.), the Taima 
mandala (q.v.), and the Shokai mandala. 
In addition to these, there are a number
 of other Pure Land designs of this 
mandala type. The prototypes for these 
mandalas were established by the eight 
century in China. Paradise scenes can be
 found from as early as the begining of 
the T'ang dynasty (618-907) at Tun-huang
. The Chinese sense of order pervades 
these formal, geometric depictions of 
Paradise, and the architectural 
arrangements reproduce the layout of T'
<pb n="323"/>
ang monasteries and palaces. The classic
 paradise scene shows a vast landscape 
dominated by an architectural complex. 
There are aerial pavillions constructed 
on one another at perpendicular angles. 
Spaced at regular intervals, often in 
diamond or square-shaped patterns, stand
 numerous Bodhisattvas and divine 
attendants. Some deities fly through the
 air and others descend on clouds, while
 the elect dance to the sound of 
instruments played by celestial 
musicians. 
The foreground shows a pond covered with
 lotus flowers and the famous 'jewel 
trees' described in the sutras. The 
Buddha sits on a lotus throne in the 
center of the composition, behind an 
altar covered with offerings. Although 
the pavillions reflect the Chinese style
 of architecture, all the deities are 
dressed in Indian costumes." 



<xa>PURE</xa>
<_-xa>Pure Land School</_-xa>

"Devotion to Amitabha Buddha was, prior 
to the Chinese Patriarch Hui-yuan (344-
<pb n="324"/>
416), an optional practice within 
Buddhism. Hui-yuan established this 
practice as an independent activity, and
 developed a new Buddhist school around 
it by forming the White Lotus Society in
 402. His disciple T'an-luan (476-542) 
organized the school, and is recognized 
as a patriarch. They emphasize Amitabha'
s(shortened to Amita and rendered A-mi-t
'o in Chinese) vow to cause all faithful
 beings to be reborn in his paradise, 
focusing religious practice on 
repetition of the phrase known as the 
Nien-fo: 'Nam-mo A-mi-t'o Fo,' literally
 meaning 'Homage to Amita Buddha.' 
Because the school relies on the saving 
grace of Amitabha Buddha, it is often 
referred to as the 'easy path' of	
dependence on outside help (Yzu-li in 
Chinese; tarilki in Japanese). Textually
, the school utilizes the Amitabha 
Sutras and the Meditation Sutra. The 
school was passed down through a 
succession of masters including. Tao-cho
 (562-645), Shan-tao (613-681), and Tz'u
-min (680-748). Due to its simplicity of
 practice, it was better able to survive
 periods of decline, and thus weathered 
the Chinese anti-Buddhist persecution of
 845 better than virtually all other 
<pb n="325"/>
Buddhist schools. It was founded m Japan
 as the Jodo school by Honen (1133-1212)
, where (together with a later offshoot,
 the Jodo-shinshu school), it remains 
the most popular school."

For a summary of this entry, see Pure 
Land Buddhism (Summary).

(I) GENERALITIES
"Pure Land or Amidism: generic term 
under which are comprehended all schools
 of East Asian Buddhism that have made 
Amitabha the central point of their 
teaching." 
<pb n="326"/>

"This is the general name of those 
doctrines which teach that man can 
attain Buddhahood by being born in the 
Pure Land of Amitabha. In India, this 
teaching was advocated by Asvaghosa, 
Nagarjuna, and Vasubandhu, and was based
 upon various sutras such as the two 
Sukhavaa-vyuhas (Amitabha Sutras)." 

"Historically, the roots of Pure Land go
 back to Ancient India, albeit the 
tradition was not emphasized: "Although 
a school dedicated to Amitabha Buddha 
worship did arise in India, piety toward
 this Buddha seems to have been merely 
one of many practices of early Mahayana 
Buddhism." (Joji Okazaki, Pure Land 
Buddhist Painting, p.14.)

(II) PURE LAND GOAL:
"The aim of the Pure Land method is the 
Buddha Recitation Samadhi, achieving, in
 totality, our Self Nature Amitabha -- 
the realm of the 'Ever-Silent 
Illuminating Pure Land.' However, the 
most urgent and immediate aim is rebirth
 in the Pure Land. This ensures an end 
to Birth and Death, and then, through 
the excellent environment of the Land of
<pb n="327"/>
 Bliss, progress in cultivation and 
swift attainment of Buddhahood. For this
 reason, Pure Land cultivators should 
recite the name of Amitabha Buddha. This
 is the principal approach of Pure Land;
 it does not consist of rapidly reaching
 the realm of No-Thought and becoming 
enlightened to our Original Nature, as 
in Zen. However, while working toward 
that goal, the practitioner should 
recite until he reaches the state of 
onepointedness of mind. Thus, although 
he does not seek the realm of 'No-
Thought,' that realm will nevertheless 
appear naturally. Moreover, it will 
appear that much sooner, thanks to the 
virtues accumulated through Buddha 
Recitation, which help to erase bad 
karma swiftly. Here we can see a new ray
 of light, a new vista: to achieve 'No-
Thought' swiftly, to become enlightened 
to the Original Nature speedily, we 
should recite the Buddha's name all the 
more. Probing deeper, if we have the 
roots and the temperament of Mahayana 
followers, we should understand that the
 ultimate goal of Buddha Recitation is 
to achieve Buddhahood. If we understand 
that goal to be merely the elimination 
of deluded thoughts, we have already 
<pb n="328"/>
strayed into the 'Five Meditations to 
calm the mind' approach of the Theravada
 tradition. Why is it that the goal of 
Buddha Recitation is to become a Buddha?
 It is because as soon as we begin 
reciting, the past, present and future 
have lost their distinctions, marks 
exist but they have been left behind, 
form is emptiness, thought is the same 
as No-Thought, the realm of the Original
 Nature 'apart from thought' of the 
Tathagata has been penetrated. This 
state is Buddhahood. What else could it 
be?" (From Buddhism of Wisdom and Faith.
) 
"The immediate goal of Nien-fo (Buddha 
Recitation) practice is to 'forge the 
karmic connection or circumstances' that
 will eventuate in one's rebirth in the 
Pure Land. Recitation of Amitabha's name
 and the earnest wish to be reborn in 
Sukhavati are central to this process. 
However, equally key to their success is
 the cultivation of 'a one pointed and 
unperturbed mind' -- a term that admits 
various interpretations, but which the 
monastic tradition mainly takes to mean 
sustained meditative concentration or 
samadhi. In the eyes of the clerically-
centered Pure Land movement, samadhi is 
<pb n="329"/>
both an essential factor in and 
signature of the successful forging of 
the karmic conditions for rebirth." 

"Some of our readers may be led to think
 that the sole object of the Pure Land 
devotees is to be born in Amida's Land 
of Bliss and Purity ... But the fact is 
that the birth itself ... is not the 
object, but to attain enlightenment in 
the country of Amida where conditions 
are such as to ensure a ready 
realization of the true Buddhist life ..
. If we can say so, to be born in the 
Pure Land is the means to the end; for 
Buddhism in whatever form is a religion 
of enlightenment and emancipation." (D.T
. Suzuki in The Eastern Buddhist, Vol. 3
, No. 4, p.321.) 

(III) PURE LAND PRACTICE:
"The practice of the school consists 
primarily in the recitation of Amitabha'
s name (nembutsu) and/or in visualizing 
Amitabha and his paradise. The sutras 
used as the scriptural foundation of the
 school are the two Amitabha Sutras and 
the Amitayurdhyana Sutra (Meditation 
Sutra). The recitation of Amitabha's 
name serves to bring the mind under 
<pb n="330"/>
control. The practitioner commits 
himself to a certain, usually very large
, number of repetitions. This recitation
 can be done out loud or silently, with 
or without concentration on an image of 
Amitabha. This is the predominant 
Practice of the school. A less frequent 
practice consists of visualizations/ 
meditations -- particularly the 
sixteenth variant described in the 
Meditation Sutra. The supreme stage of 
practice is the contemplation of Buddha 
Amitabha as not separate from one's own 
being." 

In the Pure Land method, all wholesome 
practices are valid as long as the 
merits accrued are dedicated to rebirth 
in the Pure Land. However, ideally, the 
main practice should be Buddha 
Recitation. If the practitioner engages 
indifferently in a variety of practices,
 his cultivation lacks focus and he may 
inadvertently forget about the all-
important goal of rebirth in the Pure 
Land. Moreover, the main practice is no 
longer the main Practice because there 
is, in fact, no main Practice at all. 

Pure Land Retreat
<pb n="331"/>
"From as early as the Tang period we 
hear of the existence of 'Pure Land 
Cloisters' within larger monastic 
complexes, where a congregation of self-
professed Pure Land mendicants could 
pursue a collective regimen of Pure Land
 practice and study. Over the centuries 
that followed, influential Pure Land 
masters have periodically sought to 
organize individual monasteries along 
Pure Land lines. The Ming dynasty master
 Chu Hung (1535-1615) and Republican 
period master Yin Kuang (1861-1940) 
represent two such figures who have had 
a profound impact on the monastic form 
of Pure Land Buddhism in modern times. 
Both instituted comprehensive plans for 
adapting traditional monastic structures
 and routines to the specific purposes 
of Pure Land devotion, including the 
creation of halls for the concentrated 
recitation of the Buddha's name that 
were modeled on the traditional Chan 
meditation hall. At the same time, monks
 and nuns of the Pure Land school 
developed a number of distinctive forms 
of retreat that are organized along the 
lines of the Seven-Day Retreat for 
Buddha-mindfulness (Buddha Recitation, q
.v.) but apply its program to a more 
<pb n="332"/>
intensive monastic setting."

(IV) SPECIAL FEATURES:
"The Pure Land or Lotus school of 
Buddhism is the oldest of the present 
schools of Buddhism in East Asia. Its 
influence, I should add, has been very 
much greater than the number of its 
recognized members would indicate; for 
it eventually permeated to a 
considerable degree all the other 
schools. Had not Buddhism been presented
 in this form, it is unlikely that it 
ever would have been able to get the 
strong hold upon (East Asians) in the 
centuries following (Master) Hui Yuan's 
(q.v.) time." 

i. "It is like lighting a fire on top of
 ice. As the fire intensifies, the ice 
will melt. When the ice melts, then the 
fire will go out. Those people of a 
lower grade of ' rebirth who rely on the
 power of reciting the Buddha's name ...
 even though they do not understand the 
birthlessness of the Dharma Nature, will
 attain the realm of birthlessness and 
<pb n="333"/>
will see the flame of rebirth 
spontaneously disappear at that time." (
Quoted in D. Chappell, "Chinese Buddhist
 Interpretations of the Pure Land." 
Buddhist ＆ Taoist Studies I, p.42.)

ii. "High-ranking masters of the 
Buddhist canon have often commented: The
 Buddha Recitation method encompasses 
the Zen, Scriptural Studies, Discipline 
(Vinaya) and Esoteric (Tantric) Schools.
 Why is it that Buddha Recitation 
encompasses all four schools? It is 
because when reciting the Buddha's name,
 we rid ourselves of all deluded 
thoughts and attachments, which is Zen. 
The sacred words 'Amitabha Buddha' 
contain innumerable sublime meanings, 
hidden in and springing forth from those
 words, which is the Scriptural Studies 
School. Reciting the Buddha's name at 
the deepest level stills and purifies 
the three karmas (of the mind, speech 
and body), which is the Discipline 
School. The words 'Amitabha Buddha' have
 the same effect as a mantra, 
eliminating grievances and wrongs, 
severing evil karma, granting wishes and
 subduing demons. This is the Esoteric 
School." 
<pb n="334"/>

iii. "Exchanging the virtues of Buddha 
Recitation for the petty merits and 
blessings of this world is certainly not
 consonant with the intentions of the 
Buddhas. Therefore, practitioners should
 recite the name of Amitabha Buddha for 
the purpose of escaping the cycle of 
Birth and Death. However, if we were to 
practice Buddha Recitation for the sake 
of our own salvation alone, we would 
only fulfill a small part of the Buddhas
' intentions. What, then, is the 
ultimate intention of the Buddhas? The 
ultimate intention of the Buddhas is for
 all sentient beings to escape the cycle
 of Birth and Death and to become 
enlightened, as they are. Thus, those 
who recite Amitabha Buddha's name should
 develop the Bodhi Mind (aspiration for 
Supreme Enlightenment). The word "Bodhi"
 means "enlightened." There are three 
main stages of Enlightenment: the 
Enlightenment of the Sravakas (Hearers);
 the Enlightenment of the Pratyeka (Self
 Awakened) Buddhas; the Enlightenment of
 the Buddhas. What Pure Land 
practitioners who develop the Bodhi Mind
 are seeking is precisely the 
Enlightenment of the Buddhas. This stage
<pb n="335"/>
 of Buddhahood is the highest, 
transcending those of the Sravakas and 
Pratyeka Buddhas, and is therefore 
called Supreme Enlightenment or Supreme 
Bodhi. This Supreme Bodhi Mind contains 
two principal seeds, Compassion and 
Wisdom, from which emanates the great 
undertaking of rescuing oneself and all 
other sentient beings. To reiterate, the
 Bodhi Mind I am referring to here is 
the supreme, perfect Bodhi Mind of the 
Buddhas, not the Bodhi Mind of the 
Sravakas or Pratyeka Buddhas." 

(V) PURE LAND TEXTS/ BOOKS A limited 
number of books providing an overall, in
-depth view of Pure Land Buddhism are
available in English. Recent 
publications include: i) On Amidism by 
Elder Master T'an Hsu (1973 and 1997, 
Buddhist Association of the US); ii) 
Mind-Seal of the Buddhas (Master Ou-i's 
commentary on the Amitabha Sutra, 
translated in 1997 by Dr. J.C. Cleary); 
iii) Horizontal Escape by Master Thich 
Thien Tam (1994, Sutra Translation 
Committee of the US ＆ Canada, Bronx, NY)
. This same work by Master Thich Thien 
Tam has also appeared as Buddhism of 
Wisdom and Faith, published by three 
<pb n="336"/>
different organizations: the 
International Buddhist Monastic 
Institute, (USA), the Corporate Body of 
the Buddha Educational Foundation (
Taiwan) and the Amitabha Buddhist 
Society (Malaysia). It is also one of 
six Sutra Translation Committee books on
 Pure Land reprinted privately in Hong 
Kong.

(VI) FAMOUS QUOTES: # "Speak one 
sentence less of chatter;/ Recite once 
more the Buddha's name./ Recite until 
your false thoughts die and/ Your Dharma
 Body will come to life." # "Develop the
 Supreme Bodhi Mind ; / Achieve 
singlemindedness; / The Pure Land is 
yours."

(VII) NOTE:
"The principal and essential goal of 
Pure Land practice is to achieve rebirth
 in the Pure Land within one lifetime so
 as to reach the stage of Non-
Retrogression (q.v.). This is what sets 
Pure Land apart from other schools and 
gives it its name." (T.T.Tam). To insure
 success, however, the cultivator needs 
to fulfill two crucial conditions: 
develop the Bodhi Mind (q.v.) and 
<pb n="337"/>
practice Buddha Recitation to the level 
of one pointedness of mind (q.v.). 
Seeking auspicious signs of future 
rebirth is also recommended.

<_-xa>Pure Land Buddhism (summary)</_-xa>;
 <_-xa>Other Power</_-xa>; <_-xa>Zen / Pure
 Land</_-xa>

"Everyone can appreciate why the Pure 
Land method particularly Oral Invocation
, is an easy method. However, the word '
easy' has many meanings, with which not 
everyone will be familiar. This is 
because when practicing other methods, 
for example, Scriptural Studies (q.v.) 
we encounter an immense number of sutras
 and commentaries, infinitely profound 
in meaning. In the first instance, the 
practitioner should fully understand the
 basic teaching and, from there, 
penetrate the different shades of 
meaning. After that, he should reconcile
<pb n="338"/>
 all meanings, extracting their kernel 
and essence, to discover and choose the 
method of cultivation that he will 
follow all his life. All this cannot be 
done unless he is willing to spend 
several dozen years of hard work. Should
 he decide to seek liberation through 
the Discipline School (which teaches the
 strict application of the precepts), 
the practitioner must join the Order and
 become thoroughly conversant with all 
aspects of the different bodies of 
precepts. He should also possess the 
wisdom to distinguish meaning from words
 and apply the precepts in a flexible 
manner, according to the environment, 
the times and the occasion. Thus, to 
study the sutras is not necessarily 
difficult, but to study the precepts to 
the point of knowing how to adapt them 
skillfully, neither breaking them nor 
being rigidly bound by them, is truly 
difficult. Once having understood the 
precepts, the practitioner must exercise
 patience and fortitude and endure 
discomfort and suffering in order to 
achieve success. If he decides to enter 
the Way through Zen, he should have 
previously sown the seeds of wisdom and 
have suitably high innate capacities. 
<pb n="339"/>
Otherwise, he has no hope of attaining 
this lofty Dharma and participating in 
the "transmission of the lamp" (q.v.). 
Therefore, a famous Buddhist scholar 
once said: Practicing Zen to achieve 
Buddhahood is the domain of scholars 
endowed with wisdom. This observation is
 certainly not incorrect or exaggerated.
 With the Pure Land school particularly 
Buddha Recitation, once the practitioner
 has developed the mind of Faith and 
Vows, he can recite the Buddha's name 
and engage in cultivation regardless of 
whether his capacities are high, 
moderate or limited. Moreover, while 
other methods depend on self-power alone
, the Pure Land Method first relies to 
the utmost on self-power and then adds 
the element of "other-power." Other-
power is precisely the infinitely great 
and powerful Vow of Amitabha Buddha "to 
welcome and escort."
As long as a practitioner sincerely 
repents and recites the Buddha's name 
with one-pointedness of mind, even 
though he is not yet free of delusions 
and is still afflicted with heavy evil 
karma, he, too, will be welcomed to the 
Pure Land. The ancients used to say, by 
way of comparison: Practicing other 
<pb n="340"/>
methods is as difficult and laborious as
 an ant climbing a high mountain; 
reciting the Buddha's name seeking 
rebirth in the Pure Land is as swift and
 easy as a boat sailing downstream in 
the direction of the blowing wind. This 
observation is very appropriate indeed. 
Moreover, once reborn there, living in 
an auspicious and peaceful environment, 
always in the company of Buddha Amitabha
 and the Bodhisattvas, the practitioner 
will swiftly achieve success in whatever
 Dharma method he chooses. He is like a 
log rolling down a high mountain, which 
just keeps going and never stops, even 
for a moment. In summary, Buddha 
Recitation is easy for three reasons: 
easy practice, easy achievement of 
rebirth in the Pure Land, easy 
attainment of Buddhahood. Therefore, the
 results achieved through Buddha 
Recitation from time immemorial can be 
compared to the clear and limpid sound 
of precious stones striking against 
genuine gold, or the sight of "smiling 
lotus blossoms with their fresh and 
fragrant grades of rebirth." Within 
these levels and grades, the path from 
sentient being to Buddhahood contains 
many ranks, yet is also without rank. 
<pb n="341"/>
This is because, once reborn in the Pure
 Land, the practitioner has transcended 
Birth and Death -- and to recite the 
Buddha's name is to become Buddha. This 
is like the silkworm, the chrysalis and 
the butterfly, which are inseparable; 
there is very little difference between 
saying that a butterfly is originally a 
worm or that the worm is the butterfly."
 

"If we were to use Buddha Recitation to 
discover the Mind-Ground and awaken to 
our Original Nature, the Pure Land 
method would be no different from other 
methods. However, when we rely on Buddha
 Recitation to seek rebirth in the Pure 
Land, this method has unique 
characteristics. 

The strength and pervasiveness of Pure 
Land are such that its main practice, 
buddha-remembrance (recitation), is 
found in other schools, including the 
Tantric and Zen schools. In Pure Land, 
recitation is practiced for the 
immediate purpose of achieving rebirth 
in the Land of Amitabha Buddha. In the 
Tantric school, the immediate aim is to 
destroy evil karma and afflictions and 
<pb n="342"/>
generate blessings and wisdom in the 
current lifetime. In Zen, the koan of 
buddha-recitation is meant to sever 
delusive thought and realize the Self-
Nature True Mind. The ultimate goal of 
all three schools is, of course, the 
same: to achieve enlightenment and 
Buddhahood. A question that immediately 
arises is how two methods seemingly so 
opposite as Pure Land and Zen can lead 
to the same goal of Buddhahood. As an 
analogy, supposing a patient is admitted
 to the hospital with a high fever. The 
physician will, of course, prescribe a 
medication to lower the fever. However, 
if later in the day, her temperature has
 dropped to a dangerously low level, he 
will attempt to raise it with another 
prescription. The immediate goal is 
different in each case, but the ultimate
 goal in both is the same: to normalize 
the temperature of the patient. The 
Buddha, as the master physician, 
likewise employs 84,000 methods (i.e., 
an infinite number) to treat the 84,000 
afflictions of sentient beings. 



<xa>PURE</xa>
<pb n="343"/>
<_-xa>Three Pure Land sutras</_-xa>



<xa>PURE</xa>
<_-xa>Pure Land Buddhism (summary)</_-xa>;
 <_-xa>Sukhavati淨土</_-xa>

"In Mahayana Buddhism, Pure Lands are 
realms created by the compassion of a 
Bodhisattva or Buddha where beings may 
aspire to be born in order to complete 
the path to Enlightenment under more 
propitious circumstances." 

"In Mahayana cosmology, there are 
virtually countless Buddhas, and so are 
there countless 'Pure Lands' where these
 Buddhas dwell. By their very nature, 
these Pure Lands are paradises, 
resplendent with manifold benefits and 
beauties, and as such, ideal places for 
rebirth. Nonetheless, existence even in 
a Pure Land cannot be considered 
permanent, and must be viewed as only a 
more favorable location from which to 
pursue one's on-going path to salvation.
 It is, however, an especially important
 oasis in times of Dharma decline when 
earthly conditions seem not to favor 
<pb n="344"/>
spiritual development and advancement. A
 number of Pure Lands became quite 
important in the development of Mahayana
 texts. Pursuit of rebirth in Amitabha's
 Pure Land developed into a formal 
Buddhist school which gained (the widest
) following in East Asian Buddhism." 

"The 'pure land' reflects a concept 
associated with the Mahayana Bodhisattva
 practice of 'purifying the Buddhaland.'
 'Purification' in this context refers 
to the spiritual process of leading all 
beings dwelling within the Bodhisattva's
 realm to enlightenment. This idea finds
 clear expression in such early Mahayana
 sutras as the Prajnaparamita, Lotus, 
Dasabhumika (Ten Stages) and Vimalakirti
." 

"There are two kinds of Pure Lands (of 
Phenomena): (1) those of the heavenly 
beings (deva), and (2) places such as 
that of Amitabha's Sukhavati. The 
difference between the two lies in the 
nature of the practitioner's intention 
and the quality of
religious practice involved in attaining
 rebirth. With regard to the former, the
 (adepts), who are reborn there, 
<pb n="345"/>
practice pure actions with the intent to
 attain some form of existence. They are
 still attached to the idea of rebirth 
in some higher level of existence. 
Consequently, they gain rebirth in one 
of the heavens of the Realm of Desire (
kama-dhatu) or Realm of Form (rupa-dhatu
). The second subgroup of Pure Lands 
differs from the first in that its 
aspirants seek to transcend the Three 
Realms. Hence, the Pure Lands that they 
attain, such as Amitabha's Sukhavati and
 the Realm of Fragrances (Vimalakirti 
Sutra) are not located within the Triple
 Realm. Beings in those Pure Lands have 
transcended Birth and Death." 



<xa>PURE</xa>
<_-xa>Pai-chang</_-xa>

"A written work containing the rules for
 life in a Zen monastery established by 
the Chinese Ch'an (Zen) master Pai-chang
 Huai-hai. The regulations recorded in 
this work are considered authoritative 
to the present day." 
"Pai-chang Huai-hai stressed monastic 
discipline and is credited with the 
<pb n="346"/>
writing of the first monastic code for 
Ch'an monks, the Pure Rules of Pai-chang
. The Pure Rules stipulate that the 
ritual performed during a monk's 
cremation ceremony must include the 
recitation of Amitabha's name." 

Excerpts from "Pure Land Buddhism: 
Dialogs with Ancient 
"Elder Zen Master Pai Chang of Huai Hai 
(one of the most famous Zen Masters of 
all time) was the direct successor to 
the great Zen Master Ma Tsu of Chiang 
Hsi. Zen communities throughout the 
world are established on his model and 
have adopted his Pwe Rules. Since 
ancient times, no one has dared to 
criticize or violate this set of rules. 
According to these Rules, prayers for 
the benefit of seriously ill monks and 
nuns include the following passage: 'The
 fourfold assembly should gather 
together, and all should recite verses 
of praise to Amitabha Buddha and chant 
his name from one hundred to one 
thousand times. At the end, the 
following words of transference should 
be read: If conditions have not yet come
 to an end, let him quickly recover. If 
the time of death has arrived, we pray 
<pb n="347"/>
that he will be reborn in the Pure Land.
' Is this not pointing the way back to 
the Pure Land? 
Moreover, the liturgy for sending off 
deceased monks includes this passage: "
the great assembly should all recite the
 name of Amitabha Buddha in unison, 
transferring the merits and making the 
following vow: Let his soul be reborn in
 the Pure Land, his karma in the world 
of dust severed; let him be 
reborn in the upper lotus grade, with a 
golden body. May he also receive a 
prediction of Buddhahood in one lifetime
." Is this not pointing the way back to 
the Pure Land? 
Furthermore, at the time of burial or 
cremation, the Pure Rules stipulate: '"
The monk in charge of the service should
 lead the way, striking the small bell, 
and recite the name of Amitabha Buddha 
ten times, with the great assembly 
following in unison. After recitation, 
the following words of transference 
should be read: We have just intoned the
 Buddha's name ten times to assist in 
rebirth ..." Is this not pointing the 
way back to the Pure Land? It is for

and being reborn in the Land of Bliss.

Amitabha, rebirth is completely 
miraculous." 

(I) Ways to attain rebirth
Mahayana sutras teach many ways to 
attain salvation and rebirth in the Pure
 Land, i.e., through the power of vows, 
the power of mantras, the accumulation 
of good deeds, the recitation of 
Amitabha's name until one-pointedness of
 mind is achieved. However, the main 
practice for achieving rebirth in the 
Pure land is Buddha Recitation -- the 
singleminded recitation of Amitabha 
Buddha's name either during one's 
lifetime or at the time of death. 

(II)How to Ensure Rebirth 
<pb n="358"/>
A. Normal circumstances: perseverance ＆ 
singlemindedness.
"A laywoman once approached a well-known
 Elder Master and asked: 'I have recited
 the Buddha's name for some time now, 
but have not seen any sign of progress. 
Can you explain to me why this is so?' 
The abbot said, 'Reciting the Buddha's 
name is not difficult; the difficulty 
lies in perseverance. Perhaps you have 
not recited regularly and in a 
persevering manner.' The laywoman 
replied, 'You are entirely right. I am 
usually interrupted in my recitation and
 have not been persevering, because of 
family obligations. From now on, I will 
put aside all distractions and vow to 
keep reciting exactly as taught.' Some 
time later, she returned and asked, '
Since receiving your instructions last 
time, I have put aside all external 
distractions and recited the Buddha's 
name regularly, every day. Why is it 
that I still do not see any results?' 
The abbot replied, 'Reciting the Buddha'
s name is not difficult; the difficulty 
lies in perseverance. Persevering is not
 difficult; the difficulty lies in being
 singleminded. Although, on the surface,
 you may have put all distractions aside
<pb n="359"/>
, in your mind you still worry about 
possessions and property and are still 
attached to children and family. You 
have neither discarded worry nor 
eliminated the root of love-attachment. 
How can you achieve one-pointedness of 
mind and see Amitabha Buddha?' Hearing 
this, the woman sighed aloud 'That is so
 true, Master! Although I have seemingly
 abandoned all distractions, my mind is 
still preoccupied with them. From now on
, I vow to disregard everything and 
recite the Buddha's name singlemindedly.
' Thereupon she went home and, from that
 time on, each time her children or 
anyone else sought her advice or 
confided in her, she would invariably 
reply, 'I want peace of mind, and do not
 wish to be bothered by anything.' For 
this reason, everyone referred to her as
 'the woman who is above all worry and 
care.' A few years later, she went to 
bow to the abbot at his temple, saying, 
'Thanks to your advice and teaching, I 
have now achieved one-pointedness of 
mind and seen Amitabha Buddha. I have 
come to pay my respects and take leave 
of you, Abbot, because I will soon be 
reborn in the Pure Land.' The laywoman 
in our story achieved liberation because
<pb n="360"/>
 she was enlightened to two principles: 
perseverance and singlemindedness. Thus,
 to be successful, the Pure Land 
practitioner should consider everything,
 from personal possessions and property 
to family and friends, to be illusory 
and phantom-like, coming together 
temporarily and then disintegrating. If 
we care about family and friends, we 
should ensure our own rebirth and 
liberation and then rescue them. This is
 true affection! Therefore, to recite 
the Buddha's name effectively, we should
 not only ignore one hundred 
distractions, we should discard all 
distractions, be they one thousand or 
tens of thousands!" 

B. Time of death: singlemindedness alone
.
"According to the Meditation Sutra, even
 the most evil person may be reborn in 
the Pure Land, if at the time of death 
he or she is able to embrace the Pure 
Land faith and maintain single-minded 
and undisturbed recollection of the 
Buddha Amitabha for 'ten successive 
moments.' Hence, although Pure Land 
Buddhism ordinarily encourages that one 
turn to Amitabha sooner rather than 
<pb n="361"/>
later in life, the ten moments of 
mindfulness nonetheless provide a last-
minute means of assuring one's salvation
." 

In the Meditation Sutra (q.v.), 
Sixteenth Meditation, two key phrases 
are "on the verge of death" and "utmost 
sincerity and devotion." When a wicked 
person, on his deathbed, senses evil 
omens arising from his subconscious and 
he sees no possible alternative, a mind 
of utter sincerity and devotion is 
sometimes possible. Such a frame of mind
 is extremely difficult to develop in 
the course of everyday life. 

Illustrative story
There was once a Zen monk meditating on 
a deserted mountain far away from all 
human habitation. Because of the rigors 
of the climate and the isolation of the 
place, he found it difficult to 
concentrate. His mind constantly 
wandered toward life in the village down
 below. One evening, as he was seated 
lost in errant thought, he had the 
sensation that he was being watched. He 
slowly turned his head, and lo and 
behold, there was a tiger crouched in 
<pb n="362"/>
the bushes behind him! One false move 
and the tiger would pounce on him. He 
had no choice but to remain ramrod 
straight, in singleminded concentration.
 When dawn broke, the tiger, fearful of 
the light of day, gave up this cat-and-
mouse game and disappeared The next two 
evenings, the monk, faithful to his vow,
 resumed his meditation at the appointed
 time and place. The tiger returned and 
the scene repeated itself each evening. 
When daylight came on the third day, the
 monk, after three nights of 
singleminded concentration, experienced 
a Great Awakening, collapsed and died. 
At his funeral, a tiger was seen 
watching and wailing in the 

C. Sudden death. "What happens in the 
case of a Buddhist who dies suddenly 
without having time to invoke the Buddha
's name. Would he achieve rebirth in the
 Pure Land?"
Answer: "As the Buddha told king 
Bimbisara, when a man accumulates good 
acts, at his death he will have no 
disturbing thoughts. This is like a tree
 which leans to the west and will 
necessarily fall in that direction in 
which it has been bent ..." 
<pb n="363"/>

(III) Seeking an auspicious response
"Pure Land followers should strive 
earnestly for a response. The lives of 
sentient beings are ephemeral and easily
 cut short; the ghost of impermanence 
waits for no one. Your hair is already 
streaked with white, your face has grown
 wrinkled. The marks of decay and old 
age are very clear, and death is but a 
short time away. Therefore, you should 
strive to cultivate in earnest, to 
ensure that some auspicious and reliable
 signs of rebirth appear. 
Thus, in ancient China, Elder Master Hui
 Yuan of Lu Shan saw the Buddha rub his 
crown three times. Another Elder Master 
earnestly recited the Buddha's name and 
immediately saw Amitabha Buddha emit 
rays of light and display auspicious 
marks. In the case of still another 
Elder Master, each time he uttered the 
Buddha's name, the Great Assembly would 
see a Buddha flying out of his mouth. 
This was true for hundreds of thousands 
of his utterances; hundreds of thousands
 of Buddhas escaped from his mouth, like
 so many rosary beads, one after another
. Such responses are countless. If you 
recite Amitabha Buddha's name in earnest
<pb n="364"/>
, without interruption, it is very easy 
to see Him. Otherwise, it is very 
difficult. If you do not see the Buddha,
 you do not have affinities with Him. 
Without affinities, it is certainly 
difficult to achieve rebirth. If you are
 not reborn in the Pure Land, sooner or 
later you will descend into the evil 
realms. Thus, a single thought of 
interrupting recitation is precisely the
 karma of rebirth on the Three Evil 
Paths. You should bear this in mind and 
ponder it carefully!" (Master T'ien Ju, 
l4th c.) 

(IV)Questions and Answers
A. "Question: What is the meaning of the
 statement: 'birth (in the Pure Land) is
 certainly birth, but returning (to the 
Pure Land) is, in fact, not returning?' 
Answer: 'Birth is certainly birth' is 
from the viewpoint of phenomena; '
Returning is, in fact, not returning' is
 from the viewpoint of principle or 
noumenon. However, those who have not 
yet penetrated the subtle differences 
between noumenon and phenomena should 
just follow phenomena and marks, and 
recite the Buddha's name in an 
accomplished manner. In this way, they 
<pb n="365"/>
will achieve results. Otherwise, they 
will make the mistake, common to 
externalists and demons, of grasping at 
noumenon and abandoning phenomena." 

B. Question: "When practicing Pure Land,
 we need to attain the Buddha Recitation
 Samadhi, or at least reach the stage of
 onepointedness of mind, in order to 
achieve rebirth in the Western Land. 
Those of limited capacities are not 
necessarily able to practice. at such a 
level. Therefore, how can these sentient
 beings be reborn in the Land of 
Ultimate Bliss? And, if such persons 
cannot achieve rebirth there, how can 
Buddha Recitation be said to 'gather in'
 all types of people? 
Answer: In truth, the capacities of 
people being what they are these days, 
even one-pointedness of mind is 
extremely difficult to achieve, not to 
mention the state of Buddha Recitation 
Samadhi! However, according to the 
Meditation Sutra, if anyone who has 
committed the 'Five Grave Offenses' or '
Ten Evil Deeds' sees evil omens appear 
as he is on the verge of death, he need 
only recite the Buddha's name ten times 
with utter faith and sincerity and 
<pb n="366"/>
Buddha Amitabha will descend to welcome 
him and guide him back to the Pure Land.
 Thus, one-pointedness of mind resulting
 in rebirth in the Pure Land refers to 
the time of death, not the present time.
 However, in order to achieve such a 
state of mind at the time of death, the 
cultivator should practice Buddha 
Recitation in daily life to the point 
where it becomes second nature. As he 
constantly recites the Buddha's name in 
daily life, even though one-pointedness 
of mind is not yet achieved, the seeds 
of Buddha Recitation are accumulated and
 stored away in great quantities. On his
 deathbed, the practitioner who begins 
to recite 'activates' those seeds 
immediately and with great force, 
resulting in onepointedness of mind. 
Those of limited capacities who achieve 
rebirth in the Pure Land through Buddha 
Recitation usually fall into this 
category." 

(V) Supportive recitation 
Strongly recommended in Pure Land 
teaching for all practitioners.

<xa>RETROGRESSION</xa>
<_-xa>Non-Retrogression</_-xa>

Retrogression from the Way is the 
greatest setback for the cultivator. The
 core rationale for seeking rebirth in 
the Pure Land (rather than remaining on 
earth to pursue cultivation) is that 
within the Saha World, retrogression is 
a certainty for all but the most 
resolute practitioners. Sutras and 
commentaries abound with tales of 
retrogression by even the most advanced 
disciples. (See, for example, the story 
<pb n="373"/>
of Sariputra, a leading Arhat disciple 
of the Buddha, donating both of his eyes
 to save a Brahmin's mother as part of 
his practice of the paramita of charity,
 but then abandoning that paramita when 
one the eyes was crushed and spat upon.)

Illustrative story
"In T'ang Dynasty China, in a temple 
called Fragrant Mountain in the district
 of Loyang, there was a Buddhist monk 
named Mirror of Emptiness. He came from 
a destitute family, and, though diligent
 in his studies, was a mediocre student 
in his youth. As an adult, he used to 
compose poems, few of which are quoted 
or remembered. He would travel 
throughout central China seeking support
 from local leaders, without much result
. As soon as he would accumulate some 
savings he would fall ill, exhausting 
all his funds by the time he recovered. 
Once, he traveled to a neighboring 
district, which at that time was struck 
by famine. He was thinking of reaching 
the Temple of the Western Land, and to 
eat and regain strength, but on the way,
 felt too hungry to go further. He 
decided to rest by a snow-covered spring
, reciting verses of self-pit and 
<pb n="374"/>
despondency. Suddenly, an Indian monk 
appeared and sat down beside him. 
Smiling, he asked, 'Elder Master, have 
you already exhausted the sweet dew of 
distant travel?' He answered 'I have 
indeed exhausted the nectar of travel; 
however, my name is ... and I have never
 been a high-ranking Buddhist master.' 
The Indian monk replied, 'Have you 
forgotten the time you were preaching 
the Lotus Sutra at the Temple of ... ?' 
-- Answer: 'For the last forty-five 
years, since I was born, I have always 
been in this vicinity. I have never set 
foot in the capital and therefore cannot
 have preached at the temple you 
mentioned.' The Indian monk answered, '
Perhaps you are starving and have 
forgotten all about the past.' Thereupon
, he took an apple as big as a fist from
 his bag and gave it to the famished 
poet, saying, 'This apple comes from my 
country. Those of high Capacities who 
eat it can see the past and future 
clearly. Those of limited capacities can
 also remember events of their past life
 times.' The poet gratefully accepted 
the apple, ate it, and proceeded to 
drink the spring water. Feeling suddenly
 drowsy, he rested his head on the rocks
<pb n="375"/>
 and began to doze off. In an instant, 
he awakened and remembered his past life
 as a high-ranking Buddhist monk, 
preaching the Dharma along with fellow 
monks, as clearly as though everything 
had happened the previous day. He wept 
and asked, 'Where is the Great Abbot 
Chan these days?' The Indian monk 
replied, 'He did not cultivate deeply 
enough. He has been reborn a monk in 
Western Szechuan.' The starving poet 
asked further, 'What has become of the 
great masters Shen and Wu?' 'Master Shen
 is still alive. Master Wu once joked in
 front of the rock monument at the 
Fragrant Mountain Temple, "If I cannot 
attain Enlightenment in this life, may I
 be reborn as a high-ranking official in
 the next one." As a result, he has now 
become a top general. Of the five monks 
who were close in the past, only I have 
managed to escape Birth and Death. The 
three others are as described ... and 
you, the fourth and last one, are still 
plagued by hunger in his place.' The 
starving poet shed a tear of self-pity 
and said: 'In my previous life, for 
forty long years I took only one meal a 
day and wore only one robe, determined 
to rid myself of all mundane 
<pb n="376"/>
preoccupations. Why is it that I have 
fallen so low as to go hungry today?' 
7he Indian monk replied: 'In the past, 
when you occupied the Dharma seat, you 
used to preach many superstitions, 
causing the audience to doubt the Dharma
. In addition, you were not entirely 
faultless in keeping the precepts, 
resulting in today's retribution.' 
Having finished, the Indian monk took a 
mirror from his bowl, with flawless 
reflection on both sides, and said 'I 
cannot undo what happened in the past. 
However, If you want to know your future
 destiny, whether you will be rich or 
poor, have a long or short life, even 
the future ups and downs of the Dharma, 
just have a look in the mirror and all 
will be clear.' The poet took the mirror
 and gazed into it for a long time. 
Returning it, he said, 'Thanks to your 
compassionate help, I now know causes 
and retribution, honor and disgrace.' 
The Indian monk put the mirror back in 
his bowl, took the poet by the hand, and
 started to walk away. After about ten 
steps, he disappeared. That same night, 
the poet entered the Order at the Temple
 of the Divine Seal, and was given the 
Dharma name Mirror of Emptiness. After 
<pb n="377"/>
receiving the complete precepts of a 
Bhikshu, he traveled throughout the 
country practicing the Way, his high 
conduct and ascetic practices being 
praised by all. Later on, Zen Master 
Mirror of Emptiness once met with a 
certain layman from the Temple of the 
Western Land. Telling the latter about 
his past, he said: 'I am now 77 years 
old, my Dharma age is 32. I have only 
nine more years to live. After my death,
 who knows if the Dharma will still 
exist as it is now?' The layman, puzzled
, tried to inquire further. The Master 
did not reply. He just requested a pen 
and began scribbling some lines on the 
north wall of the tower which housed the
 Tripitaka (Buddhist canon)...The words 
represented the prophecy of Zen Master 
Mirror of Emptiness, the gist of which 
is as follows: 'The Dharma will 
experience a decline. There will be 
ruthless persecution of Buddhism, the 
period of persecution beginning in the 
840's. However, the Dharma will survive;
 the light of the Dharma will not be 
extinguished.' This prophecy is 
consonant with the destruction of 
Buddhism under the Chinese Emperor T'ang
 Wu Tsung, who ordered the razing of 
<pb n="378"/>
some 47,000 temples and forcibly 
returned hundreds of thousands of monks 
and nuns to the laity." 



<xa>REVELATIONS</xa>
"In Shanghai recently there were many 
gatherings where revelations and 
prophecies were proclaimed. Their 
messages about abandoning evil ways and 
practicing wholesome deeds, as well as 
their pronouncements on Birth and Death,
 Cause and Effect, while superficial and
 limited, are very useful for everyday 
morality and the minds of ordinary 
persons. However the points they made 
concerning the future and the Buddha 
Dharma are somewhat vague and not free 
of error. As disciples of the Buddhas, 
we should not oppose or reject those 
pronouncements, because doing so may 
hinder the good actions of others. At 
the same time, however, we should not 
repeat or extol them, lest we be guilty 
of chimerical statements and conjectures
 that bring harm and disorder to the 
Dharma and engender doubts among the 
people."

<xa>RIGHT</xa>
<_-xa>Death</_-xa>; <_-xa>Rebirth in the 
Pure Land</_-xa>

In Buddhism, right thoughts are crucial 
at the time of death as they play a 
major role in our rebirth. Those who 
have cultivated throughout life 
naturally develop right thoughts at the 
time of death. 

There are cases where virtuous people 
develop wrong thoughts at the time of 
death. This can be due to a number of 
causes, such as their children fighting 
over inheritances or too much 
displacement of the body causing pain 
and anger to the dying person. These 
lapses, however, should not be of too 
much concern to a virtuous person, as he
 is like a tree which customarily leans 
to the right. When a storm comes, the 
tree will naturally fall to the right. 
Supportive Buddha Recitation at the time

 of death is recommended as help of last

<xa>SAGES</xa>

<_-xa>Three Pure Land Sages</_-xa>

Four Levels Of Sagehood:

 Buddhas. (The word 'Sage' usually 
refers to Arhats and Buddhas only). Note
 the expression 'entering into the flow 
or the "stream (fellowship) of the sages
.'" 

Although anyone with a body undergoes 
physical suffering (even Buddha 
Sakyamuni took ill and died), the 
difference between sages and ordinary 
beings is that sages always keep the 
mind unmoved -- empty and still.
"(In the Vimalakirti Sutra,) the sage 
Vimalakirti discussed the experience of 
illness at great length ... With many 
visitors assembled to inquire after his 
health, the infirm sage took the 
opportunity to speak out against the 
human body and its limitations. 'O, 
virtuous ones, the wise do not rely upon
 the body. It is like a mass of froth 
which cannot be grasped, like a bubble 
which bursts in an instant. The body is 
like a flame arising from the thirst of 
love ... like a shadow, appearing as a 
result of karma. It is like an echo, 
<pb n="388"/>
responding to causes and conditions ... 
The body does not act of itself but is 
spun around by the force of the winds of
 passion."' (Raoul Birnbaum, The Healing
 Buddha, p.13.) It should be clear that 
although the Buddhas taught that the 
human body is a skin-bag filled with 
excrements, theirs is not a pessimistic 
view of life, but a realistic one. They 
recognized the need to use the body as a
 means to Enlightenment. Thus, one 
important injunction to monks and laymen
 is never to entertain the thought of 
suicide.

wife and child in search of the meaning 
of existence. One morning at the age of 
thirty-five, he realized enlightenment 
while practicing meditation seated 
beneath the Bodhi tree. Thereafter, He 
spent the next forty-five years, until 
his death at the age of eighty, 
expounding his teachings ... in order 
that all sentient beings might realize 
the same enlightenment that he had. 
Nowadays, the term 'a Buddha' denotes 
anyone who has realized enlightenment, 
while 'the Buddha' refers to the 
historical Buddha, Sakyamuni. 'Buddhas,'
 naturally refers to all enlightened 
beings." 

"The Buddha's active preaching career 
lasted forty-five years... Recognizing 
at last that his death was close at hand
, he asked that his bed be placed in a 
clearing in the Sala Grove outside of 
Kusunagara (Kusinagar). He realized that
 Nirvana was coming near, and he 
preached his last sermon, the Great 
Nirvana Sutra. Then, with his head 
pointing north, his face looking west, 
lying on his right side, he died. He was
 eighty years old. After his death, the 
Malla Tribe, in whose territory he was, 
<pb n="392"/>
moved his body to a temple inside 
Kusinagar, and held a service for seven 
days. According to the law of the Wheel-
turning King, they cremated his body. 
Ambassadors from eight great countries 
of the time arrived to claim his relics.
 Their conflicting claims were settled 
by Drona-brahmana, who divided the 
relics into eight parts. Drona-brahmana 
obtained for himself the jar in which 
the relics were put, and gave the ashes 
to the representative of the Maurya 
Tribe, who arrived late. Thus there were
 eight portions in all, and these were 
placed by the respective owners in eight
 stupas erected on ground sacred to the 
Buddha in various areas of India. Four 
months after the Buddha's death, the 
First Buddhist Council, chaired by the 
senior monk, Maha-kasyapa, was held near
 Rajagrha, the capital of Magadha. This 
marked the commencement of the effort to
 institutionalize the sangha and codify 
the scripture, which has continued to 
this day." 

In the Theravada tradition, the Birth, 
Death and Enlightenment of the Buddha 
are celebrated on the Full Moon of the 
month of Vesak (April-May).

<xa>SALVATION</xa>
<_-xa>Pure Land School</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Horizontal Escape</_-xa>

"Buddhism in East Asia offers a 
<pb n="394"/>
satisfactory cosmological explanation of
 the universe, with an ethical 
interpretation of the world, thus 
providing a total solution for human 
frailties and social ills. It is 
designed to transform suffering humanity
 into perfect beings in a Western 
Paradise (Pure Land of Amitabha Buddha).
 Its doctrine of universal salvation is 
readily accepted by East Asians, 
particularly the Chinese. The history of
 religions in China reveals that popular
 imagination was, throughout the 
centuries, profoundly stirred by the 
mythological constructions of Buddhism 
and Taoism in respect to the after-life,
 in which the consequences of human 
frailty and sin are mitigated by the 
compassionate intervention of gods, 
Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. 

Question/Answer:
"When practicing Pure Land, we need to 
attain the Buddha Recitation Samadhi, or
 at least reach the stage of one-
pointedness of mind, in order to achieve
 rebirth in the Western Land. Those of 
limited capacities are not necessarily 
able to practice at such a level. How 
can these sentient beings be reborn in 
<pb n="395"/>
the Land of Ultimate Bliss? And, if such
 persons cannot achieve rebirth there, 
how can Buddha Recitation be said to '
gather in' all types of people? 
Answer: In truth, the capacities of 
people being what they are nowadays, 
even one-pointedness of mind is 
extremely difficult to achieve, not to 
mention the state of Buddha Recitation 
Samadhi! However, according to the 
Meditation Sutra, if anyone who 
committed the 'Five Grave Offenses' or '
Ten Evil Deeds' sees evil omens appear 
as he is on the verge of death, he need 
only recite the Buddha's name one to ten
 times with all his heart (i.e, 
singlemindedly) and Buddha Amitabha will
 descend to welcome him and guide him 
back to the Pure Land. Thus, one 
pointedness of mind resulting in rebirth
 in the Pure land refers to the time of 
death, not the present time. However, in
 order to achieve such a state of mind 
at the time of death, the cultivator 
should practice Buddha Recitation in 
daily life to the point where it becomes
 second nature. As he constantly recites
 the Buddha's name in daily life, even 
though one-pointedness of mind is not 
yet achieved, the seeds of Buddha 
<pb n="396"/>
Recitation are accumulated and stored 
away in great quantities. On his 
deathbed, the practitioner who begins to
 recite 'activates' those seeds 
immediately and with great force, 
resulting in one pointedness of mind. 
Those of limited capacities who achieve 
rebirth in the Pure Land through Buddha 
Recitation usually fall into this 
category."

"Frequently translated as 'concentration
,' this word denotes a state in which 
the mind, free from distraction, is 
absorbed in intense, 'purposeless' 
concentration, thereby entering a state 
of inner serenity. With the mind thus 
completely absorbed in itself, the 
essential nature of the Self can be 
experienced directly." 

"Meditative absorption. 'Usually denotes
<pb n="397"/>
 the particular final stage of pure 
concentration.' There are many levels 
and types of samadhi (Buddha Recitation,
 Ocean Seal, Pratyutpanna ...)" 

Buddha Recitation Samadhi:
"To achieve an uninterrupted state of 
samadhi is not something a person 
leading a secular life can accomplish. 
Since it is difficult to achieve samadhi
 this way, it is best that you hold fast
 to the name of the Buddha. Whenever you
 have the time, after studying and 
managing household affairs, you ought to
 recite the Buddha name silently. In 
doing so, you should be careful to 
articulate each word clearly and to 
dwell on each utterance with all your 
heart. If you can continue doing this 
for a long time without relapsing, your 
mind will naturally be tamed, and this 
state is none other than samadhi." (
Elder Master Chu-Hung) 



<xa>SAMANTABHADRA</xa>
<_-xa>Ten Great Vows</_-xa>

Jpn/Fugen; Vn/Pho-Hien. Also called 
<pb n="398"/>
Universal Worthy. A major Bodhisattva, 
who personifies the transcendental 
practices and vows of the Buddhas (as 
compared to the Bodhisattva Manjusri, 
who represents transcendental wisdom). 
Usually depicted seated on an elephant 
with six tusks (six paramitas). Best 
known for his Ten Great Vows (q.v.). 

Each of the Ten Vows of the Bodhisattva 
Samantabhadra should be put into 
practice without interruption, in 
thought after thought, with body, speech
 and mind. Thus, the three karmas of 
body, speech and mind of the 
practitioner are pure, empty and still. 
In his lifetime, he has sown the seeds 
of rebirth in a pure realm. At the time 
of death, he will naturally be reborn in
 such a realm, of which the most 
representative is the Pure Land of 
Amitabha Buddha. This is a good 
illustration of the Pure Land/Zen 
teaching, "if the mind is pure, the land
 is pure."

"In the Avatamsaka Sutra, Samantabhadra 
makes Ten Great Vows concerning his 
Buddhist practice. In the twenty-eighth 
chapter of the Lotus Sutra, he vows to 
<pb n="399"/>
protect the Lotus Sutra, and its 
devotees. (Samantabhadra is believed to 
have the power of prolonging life, and 
esoteric rituals for this purpose are 
directed toward him.) Worship of 
Samantabhadra has been popular from 
ancient times; a number of murals in 
Central Asia and images in China and 
Japan remain in existence." 

NOTE: 
The Bodhisattva Samantabhadra is 
considered the transcendental Pure Land 
Patriarch (Master Hui Yuan was the 
temporal founder of the school in East 
Asia).



<xa>SAMATHA-VIPASYANA</xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Concentration and Insight</_-xa>
<_-xa>Meditation</_-xa>

Samatha:
"A meditational technique to calm the 
mind to a state of tranquility and 
concentration. It is practically the 
equivalent of dhyana." 

Vipasyana: "Insight, clear seeing; 
<pb n="400"/>
intuitive cognition of the three marks 
of existence, namely, the impermanence, 
suffering, and egolessness of all 
physical and mental phenomena. In 
Mahayana Buddhism, Vipasyana is seen as 
an analytical examination of the nature 
of things that leads to insight into the
 true nature of the world -- emptiness. 
Such insight prevents the arising of new
 passions. Vipasyana is one of the two 
factors essential for the attainment of 
enlightenment (bodhi). The other is 
samatha (calming the mind)." 

The name given to the entire system of 
meditation set forth by the T'ien-t'ai 
school (q.v.) whose ultimate goal is to 
perceive 'the region of the unfathomable
,' that is, the unification of the Three
 Truths (q.v.) within one's mind. '
Concentration' (Samatha) means focusing 
one's mind on one place without any 
distractions, and 'insight' (Vipasyana) 
means seeing all things as they are, 
penetrating to the ultimate reality of 
all phenomena." 

NOTE: 
The relationship between samadhi and 
wisdom (or between samatha and vipasyana
<pb n="401"/>
) is a crucial point in Buddhism. In the
 Theravada tradition, the differences 
between them are emphasized; samadhi and
 wisdom are considered separate facets 
of cultivation, to be achieved one after
 another. In the Mahayana tradition (Zen
, Avatamsaka, T'ien-t'ai, Pure Land), 
however, samadhi and wisdom are 
indivisible - true samadhi necessarily 
includes wisdom and true wisdom is 
inseparable from samadhi. Moreover, 
wisdom is not something external to be "
obtained" through practice; it is 
inherent in all sentient beings. It is 
as though we have lost a pearl at the 
bottom of a lake. When there is no wind 
and the water is calm, the pearl 
naturally becomes visible. To recover 
the wisdom-pearl, the practitioner need 
only calm the turbid waters of his mind.
 Thus, in Mahayana teaching, to 
cultivate samadhi is to attain wisdom or
 Enlightenment. This relationship is 
clearly seen in the expression "three 
non-outflow (unconditioned) studies," 
linking precepts, samadhi and wisdom.

"The third of the Three Jewels of 
Buddhism (the Buddha, the Teaching, and 
the Community). Sometimes narrowly 
defined as the community of mendicants."
 

"The monastic order founded by the 
Buddha, the members of which are called 
Bhikkhus (males) or Bhikkhunis (females)
. It is the oldest monastic order in the
 world. The act of admission to the 
order is called renouncing the world. 
The hair of the head and beard is shaved
, the yellow robe (consisting of the 
three garments) is donned, and the 
Tisarana is recited. The candidate is 
then a novice. The ordination ceremony 
takes place before a chapter of senior 
Bhikkhus and Theras. No oaths are taken,
 and the Bhikkhu is free to leave the 
Order at any time if he desires to do so
. The Bhikkhu possesses only his robes, 
alms-bowl, razor, needle and water-
strainer." 

"In ancient India the most distinctive 
<pb n="405"/>
feature of the Buddhist Sangha was 
probably its adoption of a compromise 
between the settled life-style of many 
orthodox Brahmans and the wandering 
characteristic of other traditions. By 
establishing fixed residences for three 
months in the rainy season, the Buddha 
ensured that the life of the bhikkhu 
would provide both for the establishing 
of local centres of operation and for 
the retention of at least something of 
the simplicity necessitated by the life 
of the wandering religious mendicant (
beggar). Larger settled institutions 
tended to develop later, but great 
individual mobility usually remains 
possible. This kind of inherent 
compromise is natural to the Buddhist '
middle way' and quite characteristic of 
the training rules of the Pratimoksa. A 
similar balance is clearly expected 
between the demands of discipline and a 
relaxed approach, as well as between 
respect for seniority and individual 
autonomy. Authority is collective rather
 than hierarchical, but a certain 
minimum observation is enforced. Only a 
breach of any one of four rules leads to
 expulsion (parajika, i.e. 'defeat'): 
sexual intercourse; taking human life; 
<pb n="406"/>
theft; or a dishonest claim to some 
spiritual attainment. The majority of 
the lesser rules are concerned either 
with ensuring simplicity of life-style 
or with maintaining a disciplined 
deportment. The Pratimoksa can be 
approached fairly laxly and each bhikkhu
 is in principle free to leave the 
Sangha if he wishes. Yet taken with a 
full commitment, it represents a most 
demanding training, requiring great 
attention and awareness in every action 
-- especially for the inexperienced. 
Such of course is its purpose. It is 
part of the spiritual training directed 
towards the Buddhist goal." 

"The great contribution which the 
Buddhist Order makes to the life of (
East Asians) consists in keeping before 
the minds and imaginations of the people
 the fact of religion, the reality of 
the spiritual life. Doubtless this great
 function of keeping the lamp of 
religion alight is (sometimes not well) 
performed by the Buddhist clergy. But as
 things actually are in (East Asia) 
today, and have been for many a century,
 the clergy, are the torch-bearers of 
religion, and if they should drop their 
<pb n="407"/>
light, it might well be extinguished in 
the darkness of worldly, unspiritual 
preoccupation. It is not without value 
in the life of (East Asians) that they 
should be constantly reminded of the 
fact of Buddhism, reminded of it as at 
least an unfailing potentiality. It is 
not without value that an Order of men 
and women should be consecrated to the 
lifelong study and service of religion, 
that buildings of ancient beauty should 
be devoted to the praises of the highest
 ideal that (East Asia) knows, that 
quiet cloisters should be set aside for 
meditation of holy men and of all who 
wish to meditate. It is not without 
value that the poorest beggar, the 
busiest politician, the saddest woman, 
the most guilty sinner should carry ever
 in the subconscious regions of their 
minds the thought that, if they will, 
they may go any morning or any night to 
a nearby temple, hear the solemn music 
of gong and drum and the chanting of 
monks, watch the smoke of incense ascend
 before the image of the Blessed One, 
and catch some intimation of a higher 
life, a loftier world, a deeper peace 
than they had known before." (J.B. Pratt
, The Pilgrimage of Buddhism:1928)
<pb n="408"/>

"A monk's real life is the life of the 
mind. However vividly one describes and 
illustrates the monastic setting -- the 
architecture, the ceremonial, the 
externals of preaching and meditation, 
the daily sights and sounds of the 
Sangha -- one is still leaving out the 
most vital ingredient: thought. Perhaps 
as close as we can come to the essence 
of Buddhism in a visual image is the 
face of a monk in meditation (or 
recitation) ..." 




<xa>SANGHA</xa>
<_-xa>Sangha</_-xa>

"When the Buddha was in the world, 
everyone who had left home life was 
required to recite the following verse: 
'watch over the mouth, hold the mind, 
with the body do no wrong;/Do not, in 
any way, annoy a single living being;/
Keep far away from nonbeneficial ascetic
 practices;/Cultivation such as this can
 surely save the world.'" 

<pb n="409"/>
From Zen Master T'ien Ju, ca. l4th 
century Chuna:
"Furthermore, worldly careers and 
undertakings are like a dream, an 
illusion, a bubble, an echo, existing 
for but a moment before returning to the
 void -they offer no real benefit to the
 cultivator on the path of liberation. 
Even if you have built huge, stately 
temples and monasteries, achieved great 
influence and high position, established
 friendships with numerous important 
persons of status and wealth, feeling 
deep pride 'inside,' thinking that you 
have succeeded on your path of 
cultivation, little do you realize that 
you have violated the very admonition of
 the ancient sages! This is because they
 have specifically warned: 'Those who 
have entered the Order should set their 
Minds and focus on achieving liberation 
and not be unduly preoccupied with 
mundane endeavors, as these entail 
numerous errors. Not only will they fail
 to see the heavens, the karma of hell 
has already been created! If the issue 
of Birth and Death is not resolved, all 
mundane activities are but the causes of
 suffering. One day, once their eyes are
 closed, they will revolve in Samsara 
<pb n="410"/>
according to their karma. At that time, 
they will discover that their past 
actions have only added chains to their 
yoke and firewood and charcoal under the
 "boiling cauldrons," the Dharma robe no
 longer covers their bodies, while the 
paths of various realms keep changing ad
 infinitum throughout the eons!' ... 

Repaying one's obligations: 
Cultivators have a number of important 
obligations. Let us put aside 
temporarily the debts to the Buddhas and
 our teachers. In your case, as a monk, 
do you not think that you owe a profound
 and heavy debt to your parents for 
giving you life and raising you? Having 
"left home" and all mundane activities, 
studying the Dharma far from your birth-
place for so many years, you were not 
aware of the hardships and sufferings of
 your parents. You did not know of their
 old age and illness, and so did not 
take proper care of them. When they died
, you either had no knowledge, or, if 
you were aware of it, you probably 
returned home too late. When you were 
young, in order to provide for you and 
out of concern for your welfare, your 
parents, at times, committed numerous 
<pb n="411"/>
transgressions. After death, as they 
descended upon the path of suffering, 
they hoped that you would come to their 
rescue, just as a person might wait for 
a glass of water to assuage his thirst, 
or for the pouring of rain to cease. If 
your cultivation is haphazard, your Pure
 Land karma will not bring results. Thus
, you cannot even save yourself, let 
alone your parents! In such 
circumstances, you have not only missed 
the opportunity to take care of their 
temporal needs, you are now remiss in 
your obligations to their souls. You are
 a most unfilial son indeed! The sutras 
say: "To be unfilial is to sink into 
hell." Thus, the Mind of interruption, 
of failure to cultivate assiduously, is 
indeed the karma of hell. Moreover, you 
do not weave, yet you wear clothing; you
 do not plough, yet you eat your fill. 
Living quarters, bedding, food, clothing
, medicine, etc. are all provided by 
Buddhist followers. The ancient masters 
have often admonished: "Buddhist 
followers, out of respect and veneration
 for the Triple Jewel, parcel out part 
of their meager family food budget as a 
donation to monks and nuns. If the 
latter are not blameless in their 
<pb n="412"/>
cultivation, even an inch of cloth or a 
grain of rice will have to be paid back 
in future lifetimes. To repay the favor 
of your disciples, you should follow the
 Pure Land path assiduously, to rescue 
yourself and others. If you let even a 
single intrusive thought arise and fail 
to persevere, you have become enmeshed 
in Samsara -- endlessly 'borrowing' and 
'repaying.' That very intrusive thought 
is vile karma or the karma of animality.

Buddhist sastras are commentaries and

patriarchs. 

<pb n="417"/>
Background
"Commentarial literature in Buddhism is 
that which augments, explains, and 
expands upon primary texts. In each 
Buddhist tradition, the primary 
literature, agreed to be the teaching (
or 'speaking') of Buddha, was fixed and 
closed at a relatively early date in the
 history of each tradition. Precisely 
because the canon was fixed and closed, 
new ways had to be developed to cope 
with infusing new meanings and 
interpretations into Buddha's sermons 
and disciplinary discourses if Buddhism 
hoped to remain a vital, meaningful 
religious tradition.

The vehicle that emerged to meet that 
need was the creation of an extensive 
commentarial tradition. By writing new 
commentaries on old texts, the tradition
 was able to revitalize itself, to 
remain current, and to address needs 
that have become transcultural and 
transtemporal. In the course of Buddhist
 history, additional texts appeared in 
virtually every Buddhist culture and 
tradition that were clearly not 'the 
word of Buddha,' identified with 
individual authors, but nevertheless of 
<pb n="418"/>
critical importance for the 
understanding and practice of Buddhism. 
Many of these texts have also generated 
commentaries, some of them even auto-
commentaries, and in the process, kept 
Buddhism fresh, creative, and facing an 
increasingly changing definition of 
modernity."

"A traditional practice of single-minded
 recitation of scriptures...used to 
effect escalation of consciousness and 
enhancement of mental powers.

"In the practice of scriptural recital, 
the focus of concentration works to halt
 the wandering mind and take attention 
off habitual trains of thought, while 
the structure and imagery of the 
scripture that then flow into the mind, 
bypassing the conditioned intellect, are
 able to set up new patterns of 
perception..."

Background
(Patriarch Yin-Kuang in 'Pure Land Zen, 
Zen Pure Land'):
<pb n="420"/>
"If you wish to be a Dharma master, 
lecturing on the sutras in public, you 
should first read the original texts, 
then study the commentaries and 
subcommentraries. However, should you 
discover that your intellect is average 
and your understanding not necessarily 
above others, you should concentrate on 
Buddha Recitation rather than wasting 
time and energy pursuing these non-
essential endeavors. If, on the other 
hand, you would like to engage in 
Scriptural Recital in accordance with 
your limited capacities for the benefits
 it confers, you should keep the three 
karmas of body, speech and mind utterly 
pure, earnest and sincere, bow to the 
Buddhas and sit erect, concentrating 
your mind for a moment or two, before 
opening the sutra to read aloud or 
silently. At that time, you should sit 
up straight as though you were facing 
the Buddhas, listening to their perfect 
voices, without a single lazy, 
discriminating thought. Then, without 
trying to find the meaning of the sutra,
 just recite it in one stretch from 
beginning to end. By reciting the sutras
 in such a manner, if you are of 
superior capacity, you can awaken to the
<pb n="421"/>
 Non-Dual Truth and reach the Dharma of 
True Mark. Even if you are dull and of 
low capacity, you will gain increased 
merit and wisdom, eradicating karmic 
obstructions in the process. The Sixth 
Patriarch once said: 'we can awaken our 
Mind and see our True Nature just by 
reciting the Diamond Sutra.' This quote 
refers to the practice of Scriptural 
Recital as explained above. It is 
therefore called 'samatha' (stopping or 
arresting mental processes). If you 
follow these steps, reciting any 
Mahayana sutra can lead to the opening 
of the Mind, the seeing of your True 
Nature. This does not apply to the 
Diamond Sutra alone."

Name of a light emitted by the Buddha 
while in a state of samadhi (
concentration). It is the source of an 
ancient practice in northern India (and 
later China and Japan) to exhort a dying
 person to face west, holding onto a 
<pb n="423"/>
thread attached to the finger of an 
Amitabha Buddha statue (also facing west
). The practice is designed to remind 
dying Buddhists of their vow to be 
reborn in the Pure Land.
Avatamsaka Sutra:
"It also emits a light called 'seeing 
Buddha':/ This light can awaken those 
about to die,/ Causing them to see any 
Buddha they think of,/ So when their 
life ends they can be born in that 
Buddha's pure land./
"To exhort the dying to remembrance of 
Buddha (Buddha Recitation),/ And show 
them icons for them to behold,/ Causing 
them to take refuge in the Buddha,/ Is 
how this light can be made." (T. Cleary,

"'The main problem that besets the 
modern newcomer (to Buddhism), therefore
, is not difficulty in obtaining 
teachings but the embarrassment of too 
<pb n="424"/>
much choice. At which counters of the 
spiritual supermarket to shop? Which of 
the tempting brands to choose? Really, 
though, we are in a very fortunate 
position. Because most of the major 
Buddhist schools and traditions have now
 been transmitted to the West, we have a
 clearer view of what is on offer than 
our former Asian co-religionists. We can
 therefore allow ourselves a period of 
shopping around, experimenting with this
 and that in order to find out what 
suits us best. Of course, there are some
 people who just go on shopping around 
for ever, leaving a particular counter 
whenever difficulties arise and never 
really confronting themselves or the 
demands of Buddhism. So at some point 
one usually has to make a commitment to 
a particular course of study and 
practice, but it is best not to hurry 
the process. Commitment will generally 
arise quite naturally of its own accord 
when a situation feels right, whereas 
forcing the issue can lead to trouble. 
Many teachers and groups are moreover 
eager to recruit and will sometimes 
subtly (and sometimes not so subtly!) 
pressure a newcomer to join their party.
 On the other hand, many newcomers 
<pb n="425"/>
eagerly desire the consolations of 
belonging and so often make their 
choices for the wrong reasons. Once 
committed, guard against running away. 
When Buddhism really begins to 'work', 
things often get difficult -- sometimes 
very difficult. One may, for instance, 
have to face things in oneself that he 
has been dodging for years. The ego does
 not open itself to new growth without a
 struggle either -- and sometimes an 
intense one, for every advance demands a
 kind of death to one's old self. And 
there are phases when things seem to go 
dead, like walking through endless, 
monotonous mud and sleet; or when 
agonizing doubts or fears arise. 
Remember the night that the Buddha spent
 beneath the Bodhi Tree before his 
Enlightenment. Mara has his ways of 
trying to deflect us. Try therefore to 
follow the Buddha's example and not be 
deterred. On the other hand, do not feel
 afraid to leave a group or teacher when
 it is clear that they have ceased to 
work for you. Again there can be gross 
or subtle pressure against going: it may
 be stigmatized as defection, disloyalty
 or failure. But remember, Shakyamuni 
Buddha himself was not afraid to leave 
<pb n="426"/>
his teachers when he had absorbed all 
they had to teach him. Nor was he 
deterred from discarding practices he 
had decided were not useful from fear 
that fellow practitioners would spurn or
 deride him. Always however, be watchful
; delve into your own motivations, check
 your responses and feelings, and keep a
 clear eye on what is happening around 
you, avoiding the extremes of being a 
destructive critic or a stray-eyed naif.
 The Buddhist Way is the middle way -- 
and is all about learning (and practice)
. If you do decide to leave a group or 
teacher, do so if possible in the proper
 way, with appropriate gratitude. Always
 be realistic and do not fall prey to 
illusions, especially collective ones. 
One illusion that besets many newcomers 
is that religion is good per se, so they
 expect all the people and institutions 
they encounter to be thoroughly benign. 
In fact, with rare exceptions, religious
 people and institutions are much like 
worldly ones. They have their dark as 
well as their light sides. So be 
watchful on this account, and then 
perhaps you will not be too 
disillusioned if, for instance, your 
teacher, though possessing undeniable 
<pb n="427"/>
virtues and talents, also turns out to 
have feet of clay. Also do not be 
bedazzled by charismatic teachers, or 
ones with mass followings, or great fame
, power or worldly wealth. True teachers
 have perennially kept a low profile, 
living in seclusion, not seeking crowds 
or worldly success. What they taught was
 difficult, for the few rather than for 
the many. Those who successfully 
massmarket spiritual teachings often do 
so by watering them down and adding 
seductive sweeteners. Be careful too of 
teachers and groups that pressure you 
for money or services. The Dharma is 
said to be beyond price, something that 
should be freely given. A monk does not 
ask for dana (q.v.); he waits for it 
silently. It should be left up to you to
 contribute as and when and to what 
extent you feel fit. Try for your part 
to be generous, however, not least 
because generosity fosters spiritual 
growth."

said in them of the sole right motive 
for mind-development, the enlightenment 
of the meditator for the benefit of all 
mankind, and the reader was led to 
believe that it was quite legitimate to 
study and practice mindfulness and the 
higher stages which ensue for the 
benefit of business efficiency and the 
advancement of personal prestige. In 
these circumstances, Concentration and 
Meditation ... was compiled and 
published by the (British) Buddhist 
Society, with constant stress on the 
importance of right motive, and ample 
warning of the dangers, from a headache

<xa>SELF-NATURE</xa>
<_-xa>Buddha Nature</_-xa>

"Things in the phenomenal world are 
transient, momentary, and without 
duration; hence they have no self-nature
 (self-entity)
or individual substantiality. In some 
contexts, 'self-nature' is used in an 
approbatory sense to denote the Buddha-
nature within one's mind. This usage is 
particularly common in Zen literature." 



<xa>SELF-NATURE</xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Mind-Only Pure Land</_-xa>
<_-xa>Pure Land Buddhism (summary)</_-xa>;
 <_-xa>Pure Land School</_-xa>

The expression "Self Nature Amitabha, 
Mind-Only Pure Land" represents the 
quintessence of Pure Land Buddha 
<pb n="431"/>
Recitation Practice. At the noumenon 
level (i.e., at the level of principle),
 Amitabha, the Buddha of Infinite Light 
and Infinite Life, is our Self-Nature, 
always bright and everlasting. To recite
 the Buddha's name is to return to our 
Self-Nature -- our Buddha nature... 
Hence, the expression "Self-Nature 
Amitabha Buddha, Mind-Only Pure Land" 
represents the teaching that, if the 
Mind is pure, the land, the environment 
is pure as well. This expression is 
popular in Zen. 
Buddhism of Wisdom ＆ Faith/ excerpts:
"Many who like to voice lofty principles
 frequently reject the Pure Land method 
in these terms: 'To recite the Buddha's 
name seeking rebirth in the Pure Land is
 to grasp at marks, seeking the Dharma 
outside the Mind, failing to understand 
that all dharmas are Mind-Only.' These 
individuals, seeking the subtle and the 
lofty, are in reality shallow and 
superficial! This is because they do not
 understand that if the Saha World is 
Mind-Only, then the Western Pure Land is
 also Mind-Only, and nothing can be 
found outside the True Mind. Thus, to 
recite Amitabha Buddha's name is to 
recite the Buddha of our own Nature and 
<pb n="432"/>
Mind; to be reborn in the Pure Land is 
to return to the realm of our own Mind -
- not to an outside realm! Since neither
 the Saha World nor the Pure Land is 
outside the Mind, how can remaining in 
the Saha World, enduring Samsara, 
scorched and burned by the fire of the 
Five Turbidities, be compared with 
returning to the tranquil and blissful 
Pure Land -the pure and cool realm of 
freedom? We should realize that the ones
 truly in a position to honor the Mind-
Only Pure Land are those who have 
attained the Dharma-Nature Body (i.e., 
the Buddhas), and are always free and at
 ease in all circumstances. At that time
, whether in the Saha World or in the 
Land of Ultimate Bliss, they are in a '
pure land,' in the state of Mind-Only --
 in the state of liberation. Otherwise, 
though they may discourse endlessly on 
the mystery and loftiness of the Pure 
Land, they cannot escape bewilderment 
and delusion in the 'bardo stage,' and, 
following their karma, revolving in the 
cycle of Birth and Death!" (Thich Thien 
Tam, Buddhism of Wisdom and Faith, sec. 
27)
"As we recite 'Namo Amitabha Buddha,' we
 each create and adorn our own Land of 
<pb n="433"/>
Ultimate Bliss. We each accomplish our 
own Land of Ultimate Bliss which is 
certainly not hundreds of thousands of 
millions of Buddhalands from here. 
Although it is far away, it doesn't go 
beyond one thought. It's not hundreds of
 thousands of millions of Buddhalands 
from here; it's right in our hearts. The
 Land of Ultimate Bliss is the original 
true heart, the true mind, of every one 
of us. If you obtain this heart, you 
will be born in the Land of Ultimate 
Bliss. If you don't understand your own 
original true heart, you
will not. The Land of Ultimate Bliss is 
within our hearts, not outside ... 
Amitabha Buddha and living beings do not
 discriminate between this and that, for
 the Land of Ultimate Bliss is not so 
far away. In one thought, turn the light
 within. Know that you are the Buddha, 
and your original Buddhahood is just the
 Land of Ultimate Bliss. (Hsuan Hua, 
General Explanation of the Buddha Speaks
 of Amitabha Sutra, p.110.)"
QUESTIONS/ANSWERS'
"Question I: 'Are the Mind-Only Pure 
Land and the Self-Nature Amitabha the 
same as or different from the Western 
Pure Land and Amitabha in the Pure Land?
<pb n="434"/>
' Answer: 'It is because the Mind-Only 
Pure Land exists that we are reborn in 
the Pure Land of the West. If the mind 
is not pure, it is impossible to achieve
 rebirth in the Pure Land. Even when 
those who have committed cardinal 
transgressions achieve rebirth through 
ten recitations, such rebirth is due to 
their reciting the Buddha's name with a 
pure mind, thus eliciting a response 
from Amitabha Buddha. Ordinary people 
generally think that if the Pure Land is
 Mind-Only, then it does not exist.
This is the understanding of demons and 
externalists. Such a deluded view, which
 appears correct but is in reality wrong
, affects more than half of all people 
and causes practitioners to forfeit true
 benefits. It is precisely because of 
the Self-Nature Amitabha that the 
practitioner must recite the name of 
Buddha Amitabha of the West seeking 
rebirth in the Pure Land -- so as to 
achieve the Self-Nature Amitabha through
 gradual cultivation. If he merely 
grasps at the Self Nature Amitabha but 
does not recite the name of Buddha 
Amitabha of the West, he cannot achieve 
immediate escape from Birth and Death --
 not even if he is truly awakened, much 
<pb n="435"/>
less if (like most people who ask this 
question) he is pretentious and just 
indulges in empty talk without engaging 
in- practice. Thus, the answer to your 
question (are the Mind-Only Pure Land 
and the Self-Nature Amitabha the same as
, or different from the Western Pure 
Land and Amitabha in the Pure Land?) is 
that they are one yet two before 
Buddhahood is attained, two yet one 
after Buddhahood is attained.'"

"I. One s own power, merit, intelligence

II. The term is generally used to 
indicate the attempt to attain 
enlightenment through one's own efforts 
rather than by relying upon the 
<pb n="436"/>
compassion of the Buddhas and 
Bodhisattvas (in addition to one's own 
efforts)." 
"'One's own power'; an expression 
referring to the endeavor to attain 
enlightenment through one's own efforts 
(for example, sitting in meditation). 
Jiriki (Self-Power) is generally used in
 contradistinction to tariki (Other-
Power), which roughly means 'the power 
of the other.' This refers to the fact 
that the adherents of some Buddhist 
schools (Pure Land for example) place 
their trust in the notion that belief in
 Buddha (generally, his manifestation as
 Amitabha) and calling upon his name 
will bring about rebirth in a Buddha 
paradise (Pure Land) and thus the 
liberation of the believer.
This is an approach that places the 
power of the Buddha principle to 
liberate human beings in the foreground.
 In contrast, other schools of Buddhism,
 such as Zen, place the emphasis on the 
ability to actualize enlightenment and 
achieve liberation through one's own 
efforts, i.e., through meditative 
training. This is characterized as 
jiriki. On a deeper level, as is 
stressed in Mahayana Buddhism, every 
<pb n="437"/>
sentient being and thing from the very 
beginning is endowed with the Buddha-
Nature. From this point of view, the 
opposition of jiriki and tariki must be 
regarded as an artificial one (which 
simply indicates a different emphasis in
 religious practice)."

the 'self-spoken division' of the 
Tripitaka (Buddhist canon):
'Because its principles were too

 one requested the Pure Land Dharma-door

 so the Buddha spontaneously spoke this

traditionally been defined as 'sentient'
 life and beings with minds as 'sentient

possibility for all beings with minds, 
sentient life is regarded as precious. 
Sentient beings include hell beings, 
heavenly beings, ghosts, animals, and 
humans, but not rocks and plants. Since 
deities and spirits may live in 
association with plants, plants may

<xa>SEVEN</xa>
In Buddhism and some other religions, 
the number seven has a mystical 
significance. Thus, the traditional 
<pb n="440"/>
mourning period is forty-nine (seven 
times seven) days. 
"According to the Esoteric School, the 
number seven is the ultimate number in 
the cycle of Birth and Death. Therefore,
 in the bardo stage, the 'soul' must 
undergo changes every seven days, and to
 be efficacious, mantras should be 
recited at least seven times. Buddhist 
texts note this with the words 'the 
Dharma is thus,' i.e., according to the 
law of nature it has to be that way and 
cannot be explained, just as it is 
difficult to explain why fire is hot and
 ice is cold. Starting with the number 
seven and multiplying it by three or 
seven, we have twenty-one or forty-nine.
 Therefore, the Esoteric School teaches 
that mantras should be recited (at least
) seven times to be effective, twenty-
one or forty-nine times if the mind is 
weak and agitated. Thus, basing 
themselves on this teaching, 
practitioners arrange retreat periods of
 seven, twenty-one or forty-nine days."

<xa>SEVEN-DAY</xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Retreat</_-xa>
<_-xa>Chu-Hung</_-xa>; <_-xa>Practice</_-xa>
"Around the beginning of the Sung 
dynasty (10th c. China), three hundred 
years after patriarch Shan Tao (
considered to be an incarnation of 
Amitabha Buddha and whose writings are 
accepted as scripture in Japan), 
southeast China witnessed a great 
resurgence of interest in Pure Land 
spirituality, especially among T'ien T'
ai and Chan masters of the region. Once 
again, a seven-day ritual retreat for 
Buddha-mindfulness (Buddha Recitation), 
known as the 'Amitabha Repentance' or '
Pure Land Repentance,' proved to be an 
especially popular form of Pure Land 
practice. Various incarnations of this 
same basic institution can be traced, 
intermittently, down through the Ming 
and Qing periods to the 'Seven Days of 
Buddha-Recitation' that is widespread 
among the clergy and laity of Taiwan, 
Hong Kong, and Vietnam, etc. today. It 
<pb n="443"/>
is difficult to say whether Shan Tao's 
seven-day rite of Buddhamindfulness 
played a direct role in the shaping of 
Pure Land programs of later periods. 
Nonetheless, it does describe an 
institutional and ritual paradigm that 
has seen repeated incarnations in Pure 
Land communities over the centuries. As 
a rule, the laity have been given free 
access to the seven-day retreats for 
Buddha-recitation. Nonetheless, such 
retreats are nearly always held at 
Buddhist monasteries and are led by the 
Buddhist clergy. Moreover, their strict 
codes of ritual and moral purity, as 
well as their intensive regimen of 
practice, are more characteristic of 
monastic life than they are of lay life.
 In this respect, the seven-day retreat 
represents a unique and idealized 
occasion for the Pure Land lay Buddhist 
-- one in which the ordinary householder
 is allowed access to an intense world 
of religious restraint and devotion that
 is otherwise the domain of the Buddhist
 professional. Within the world of the 
monastery itself, the intense devotion 
characteristic of the seven-day retreat 
becomes the norm rather than the 
exception." 
<pb n="444"/>
"From as early as the Tang period we 
hear of the existence of 'Pure Land 
Cloisters' within larger monastic 
complexes, where a congregation of self-
professed Pure Land mendicants could 
pursue a collective regimen of Pure Land
 practice and study. Over the centuries 
that followed, influential Pure Land 
masters have periodically sought to 
organize individual monasteries along 
Pure Land lines ... The Ming dynasty 
master Chu Hung (15 ZS-1615) and 
Republican period master Yin Kuang (1861
-1940) represent two such figures who 
have had a profound impact on the 
monastic form of Pure Land Buddhism in 
modern times. Both instituted 
comprehensive plans for adapting 
traditional monastic structures and 
routines to the specific purposes of 
Pure Land devotion, including the 
creation of halls for the concentrated 
recitation of the Buddha's name that 
were modeled on the traditional Chan 
meditation hall. At the same time, monks
 and nuns of the Pure Land school have 
developed a number of distinctive forms 
of retreat that are organized along the 
lines of the seven-day rite of Buddha-
mindfulness but apply its program to a 
<pb n="445"/>
more intensive monastic setting." 
(II) Conducting a Retreat
"If we have not attained Enlightenment, 
we should recite the Buddha's name 
seeking rebirth in the Pure Land. To 
ensure that this occurs, we should 
recite to the level of onepointedness of
 mind. And, in order to practice to that
 level, we should conduct periodic 
retreats. To be 'in retreat' is to 
retire to a small house, meditation h at
 or small room, cut off all outside 
activities and conditions and 
concentrate on reciting the Buddha's 
name for a period of seven days. Why 
seven days and not six or eight? The 
Amitabha Sutra states: 'Sariputra: if a 
good man or a good woman hears Amida 
Buddha preach and firmly holds the Name 
wholeheartedly and singlemindedly, be it
 for one day, two days, three days, four
 days, five days, six days, or seven 
days, Amida Buddha, together with all 
the holy multitudes, will appear before 
that person as the end of life draws 
near. When death arrives, that person, 
with mind undisturbed, at once gains 
rebirth in Amida Buddha's Land of Utmost
 Happiness.' (Hozen Seki, Buddha Tells 
of the Infinite: the 'Amida Kyo,' p. 53.
<pb n="446"/>
) Since the Sutra does not refer to six 
days only, nor does it speak of eight 
days, Pure Land practitioners, basing 
themselves on the words of Buddha 
Sakyamuni, have traditionally taken the 
period of retreat as seven days. 
According to the Esoteric School, the 
number seven is the ultimate number in 
the cycle of Birth and Death. Therefore,
 in the bardo stage, the 'soul' must 
undergo changes every seven days, and to
 be efficacious, mantras should be 
recited at least seven times. Buddhist 
texts note this with the words 'The 
Dharma is thus,' i.e., according to the 
law of nature it has to be that way and 
cannot be explained, just as it is 
difficult to explain why fire is hot and
 ice is cold. Starting with the number 
seven and multiplying it by three or 
seven, we have twenty-one or forty-nine.
 Therefore, the Esoteric School teaches 
that mantras should be recited (at least
) seven times to be effective, twenty-
one or forty-nine times if the mind is 
weak and agitated. Thus, basing 
themselves on this teaching, 
practitioners arrange retreat periods of
 seven, twenty-one or forty-nine days. 
In conducting a seven-day retreat, one 
<pb n="447"/>
can either practice alone, to attain 
purity more easily, or with many other 
cultivators. In either case, three types
 of good spiritual advisors are required
. 1. Teaching Spiritual Advisor. This is
 someone conversant with the Dharma and 
experienced in cultivation. The retreat 
members can have him follow their 
progress, guiding them throughout the 
retreat, or they can simply seek his 
guidance before and after the retreat. 
When several persons hold a retreat 
together, they should ask a spiritual 
advisor to lead the retreat and give a 
daily fifteen-to-thirty-minute 
inspirational talk. 2. Caretaking 
Spiritual Advisors. This refers to one 
or several persons assisting with 
outside daily chores such as preparing 
meals or cleaning up, so that those on 
retreat can cultivate peacefully without
 distraction. Such persons are called '
retreat assistants.' 3. Common Practice 
Spiritual Advisors. These are persons 
who practice the same method as the 
individual(s) on retreat. They keep an 
eye on one another, encouraging and 
urging each other on. These cultivators 
can either be participants in the same 
retreat or cultivators living nearby. In
<pb n="448"/>
 addition to keeping an eye out and 
urging the practitioners on, they can 
exchange ideas or experiences for the 
common good. An Elder Master of great 
virtue in the Zen tradition once taught:
 The practitioner should take the Ten 
Directions as his perfect Enlightenment 
seat, and not set a limit to the length 
of retreats. If one year is not 
sufficient to become enlightened, he 
should meditate for ten years. If ten 
years are not enough, then he should 
meditate for twenty or thirty years, or 
up to his whole lifetime, always 
unwavering in his determination. Pure 
Land followers should do likewise. 
Attending a seven-day retreat is the 
best expedient to reach onepointedness 
of mind. If one retreat is not 
sufficient, then he should cultivate 
during many retreats, never wavering in 
his determination."

"There is an anecdote concerning a monk

the king of the country, hearing about 
the accomplishments of the monk, sent 
his messengers to invite him to the 
palace as an honored guest. The monk 
flew to the palace as the king wished 
and in fact, did it several times. On 
one of these occasions, the king asked 
the queen to pay homage to the monk. In 
doing so, the queen knelt before him and
 put her hands upon his bare feet to 
show her highest respect. The queen's 
hands were very delicate and soft and 
the practitioner, never having had that 
kind of experience before, suddenly felt
 excited and all at once lost all 
samadhi power. He felt faint and his 
body became very weak. He had to be

China. He renounced the world at the age
 of ten and studied the Lotus, 
Vimalakirti and other sutras. Later he 
studied the Meditation Sutra and 
embraced Pure Land teaching. In 641, at 
the age of twenty-nine, he visited Tao-
ch'o at Hsuan-chung-ssu temple and heard
 him lecture on the Meditation Sutra, 
which greatly deepened his faith. 
Thereafter he went to Ch'ang-an where he
 disseminated the practice of calling 
upon the name of Amitabha Buddha." 
"The third patriarch of the Pure Land 
tradition in China whom Honen considered
 to be an incarnation of Amitabha and 
whose writings were accepted as

"He is said to have copied the Amitabha 
Sutra more than 100,000 times and made 
more than 300 paintings of the Pure Land
. He wrote five works in nine fascicles,
 including commentaries on different 
sections of the Meditation Sutra." 
NOTE:
"The importance of the Shan-tao '
Commentary on the Meditation Sutra' to 
the Japanese Pure Land Buddhists can be 
traced to Honen's personal salvation, 
which he credits to his reading of a 
passage from this text. Shinran included

The two schools of Zen, the Gradual and 
the Sudden, represent different facets 
of the same teaching adapted to 
different types of people in different 
locations. To praise one school while 
disparaging the other is therefore a 
form of attachment, a dualistic view of

"A shout without a single meaning, which
 is used by Zen masters much in the way 
a stick is used. It also serves in 
encounters between masters as a means of
 expression-transcending words and 
concepts -- just like a blow of a stick 
at the right moment can help the Zen 
student achieve a breakthrough to 
enlightened vision. According to 
tradition, such a cry was first used by 
the great Chinese master Ma-tsu Tao-i, 
who was known for his thunderous voice. 
Also famous for his skillful use of the 
'stick and shout' was Lin-chi (Jpn./ 
Rinzai)." 
"It can also be pointed out that by no 
means did all Ch'an masters of that 
period display a penchant for 
unconventional behavior. As Venerable 
Yin-shun has perceptively noted, the 
display of such methods as shouts and 
blows by individual masters is connected
 to the area of China they come from. It
 seems that (within the Sudden Zen 
School of the Sixth Patriarch Hui-Neng),
 masters from the north (e.g. Lin-chi) 
<pb n="458"/>
tend to be more inclined towards 'crude'
 behavior in comparison with masters 
from the south (e.g. Kuei-shan). ... 
This seems to imply that the

<xa>SILENCE</xa>
<_-xa>World-origin</_-xa>

"Monastic life is usually either silent 
or what is called 'noble silence,' 
speaking only when necessary." 
"The truth of non-duality was expressed 
by means of silence by Vimalakirti in a 
discussion held at Vaisali, according to
 the Vimanalakirti Nirdesa Sutra. At the
 end of the discussion, Manjusri is said
 to have praised Vimalakirti's silence 
as the true representation of non-
duality. This silence of Vimalakirti is 
called a silence like thunder."

"The historical Buddha Shakyamuni 
refrained from giving a definitive 
answer to many metaphysical questions of
 his time. This is often referred to as 
the silence of the Buddha. Again and 
again his students asked him if a self 
exists or not (anatman); if an 
<pb n="461"/>
enlightened one in any way continues to 
exist after death; if the world is 
eternal and unending or not. The Buddha 
explained that he was silent on these 
questions because answers to them would 
in no way further progress on the path -
they would not contribute to the 
overcoming of the passions nor to the 
attainment of wisdom. He was concerned 
that preoccupation with these questions 
would divert people from the path that 
leads to liberation from suffering."

NOTE:
"Something which a lot of people notice 
on meditation retreats during which 
there are extended periods of silence is
 that they experience an excess of 
energy. They feel more alive. This is 
partly because talking in itself takes 
effort but perhaps mainly because what 
we say is often an expression of 
negative emotions which waste and drain 
away energy. For this reason silence is 
an extremely important spiritual 
discipline, whether in Buddhism, 
Hinduism, or Christianity. In all these 
great spiritual traditions, silence is 
considered important, if not imperative,
 for the person who seeks to lead a 
<pb n="462"/>
spiritual life. . So the silent person 
is very often the wise person, not least
 because he or she avoids wasting energy
 on negative verbiage."

</_-xa>

"Buddhism brought to the Chinese a vivid
 concept of an after-life, and a 
doctrine of future punishment for sins 
committed in this life, an idea that 
present sufferings are the result of 
past sin. It taught that future 
retribution for sin could be avoided by 
accumulation of merit by such means as 
chanting liturgies, repentance, 
meritorious actions, asceticism and the 
like. It introduced a soteriology by its
 doctrine of (dedication of merit, q.v.)
. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have 
accumulated infinite stores of merit; by
 appealing to them in penitence and 
faith, the consequences of sin can be 
wiped out and a blissful future life 
guaranteed. These Buddhist ideas 
exercised a profound influence on 
<pb n="465"/>
Confucians and Taoists alike, and on 
popular beliefs." 
"It is important to grasp that the idea 
of an eternal damnation as a punishment 
for sin is foreign to Buddhist 
understanding. Suffering is a 
consequence of one's own action, not a 
retribution inflicted by an external 
power. Infernal torments, moreover, 
though they may last for aeons, belong 
to Samsara and are therefore not exempt 
from the law of impermanence. And even 
if the notion of a divine vengeance is 
regarded as an approximation, in 
mythological terms, to the concept of 
karmic consequences, it is perhaps worth
 suggesting that the impersonal view 
proposed by Buddhism should have the 
advantage of exorcising the paralyzing 
sense of guilt, or revolt, that can so 
often be the outcome of a too 
anthropomorphic theism. The doctrine of 
karma has only one message: the 
experience of states of being follows 
upon the perpetration of acts. We are 
the authors of our own destiny; and 
being the authors, we are ultimately, 
perhaps frighteningly, free."

<xa>SINCERITY</xa>
<_-xa>Practice (Buddhist)</_-xa>

Advice from Patriarch Yin Kuang
"Ultimately, when the practitioner 
recites to the point of pure, unmixed 
power, the totality of Mind is Buddha, 
the totality of Buddha is Mind, Mind and
 Buddha are as one. I am afraid that 
this principle and practice are not 
understood by everyone. It has always 
been my desire to proclaim them and to 
disseminate the Original Vows of 
Amitabha Buddha to rescue all sentient 
beings. How would I dare conceal this 
truth, transmitting it privately to you 
alone? If there is any secret knowledge 
to be transmitted privately in a hidden 
place, it is an externalist teaching, 
not a Buddhist teaching. Having said so,
 however, this old monk, in truth, does 
have a wonderful secret teaching, which 
only he possesses. Since you have 
requested it today, I have no qualms 
about revealing it to all Buddhist 
followers. What is this wonderful 
teaching? It is utter sincerity and 
profound respect. This secret is known 
to everyone, yet obscure to all! Wishing
<pb n="467"/>
 to eradicate deep-seated karma and 
repay the kindness of the Buddhas, I 
have endeavored, day in and day out, to 
probe the shining cultivation of the 
ancients. I have thus discovered that 
utter sincerity and profound respect 
constitute a wonderful 'secret' method 
that lifts human beings to the realms of
 the saints, enabling them to escape 
Birth and Death. Time and again I have 
brought these points to the attention of
 those who have the right conditions. 
You should know that sincerity and 
respect are not reserved exclusively to 
students of the Dharma, but form the 
basis of all activities that you want to
 complete to perfection." 
Sincerity and respect are important in 
all Buddhist practice but they are 
crucial in Pure Land. Otherwise, the 
practitioner cannot be in unison with 
Amitabha Buddha and loses the benefit of
 the Buddha's Vows.

 inherent in all things. They are: 1) 
universality -- a whole, which is 
composed of parts; 2) particularity -- 
the separate parts which constitute the 
whole; 3) similarity -- the separate 
parts are all related to the whole; 4) 
diversity -- though similar in that they
 all help constitute the whole, each 
part's relationship to the whole is

harmonization of the unique parts, the

aggregates." They represent body and 
<pb n="477"/>
mind. The five skandas are form, feeling
, conception, impulse and consciousness.
 For example, form is the physical body,
 consciousness is the faculty of 
awareness. The best known reference to 
the five skandas is found in the Heart 
Sutra. By realizing that the skandhas 
are intrinsically empty, the Bodhisattva
 Avalokitesvara has escaped all 
suffering. Note the difference between 
intellectual understanding of this 
principle and truly internalizing it (a 
good driver slams on the brakes when 
another car cuts in front of him, 
without stopping to think about it). 
Only by internalizing the Truth of 
Emptiness, through assiduous cultivation
, can suffering be transcended. 

Background
"All conditioned phenomena are made of 
aggregates. There are five aggregates, 
the first being material and 
representing the substance which 
constitutes all matter, the remaining 
four being mental and, therefore, 
restricted to functions of the mind." 

"In Buddhist philosophy, all physical, 
mental, and other elements in this 
<pb n="478"/>
phenomenal world are classified into 
five kinds of aggregates (Skt./ skandhas
): (1) rupa-skandha, a generic term for 
all forms of matter; (2) vedana-skandha,
 perception; (3) samjna-skandha, mental 
conceptions and ideas; (4) samskara-
skandha, volition; and (5) vijnana-
skandha, consciousness or mind. In the 
case of man, the rupa-skandha is the 
body, the vijnana-skandha is the. 
totality of the mind, and the other 
three skandhas are mental functions. 
Thus the five skandhas comprise the body
 and mind of all sentient beings in the 
World of Desire and the World of Form, 
but those sentient beings in the 
Formless World of pure spirit have no 
material element."

transmitted: with a flower, with a rock

<_-xa>Nichiren Shoshu</_-xa>

"Lit: Value Creation Society. The Soka 
Gakkai began in Japan in the 1930s as a 
lay organization devoted to the support 
and furtherance of the teachings of the 
Nichiren Shoshu school. During the 
postwar period, however, in the volatile
 atmosphere created by the freedom-of-
religion policies imposed by the Allied 
Occupation, the lay organization 
experienced tremendous growth. Soon the 
vast majority of Nichiren Shoshu members
 were those who had been converted by 
lay members of the Soka Gakkai, leading 
to a situation in which the tail (the 
Soka Gakkai) threatened to wag the dog (
the priestly establishment). The Soka 
Gakkai maintained an alternately 
supportive and antagonistic relationship
 with the Nichiren Shoshu priesthood 
<pb n="481"/>
until 1991, when the Soka Gakkai was 
officially excommunicated from the 
school. Long before this traumatic event
 took place, however, the Soka Gakkai 
had amassed a substantial membership in 
the United States, and this membership 
was dramatically different from that 
drawn by the Elite Buddhist groups (see 
North America (Buddhism in)). 
Advertising higher income, better health
, and improved relationships as among 
the results of Buddhist practice, the 
Soka Gakkai (first known here as 
Nichiren Shoshu of America) attracted a 
highly diverse following. In contrast to
 Elite Buddhism, whose members are 
largely of middle-class background or 
above ('We call it the Upper-Middle Way,
' one western Theravada monk told me 
with a smile), the Soka Gakkai drew its 
initial membership from a broad social 
spectrum. Though it does have a small 
percentage of highly educated members, 
only about half attended college, and 
barely a quarter hold bachelor's degrees
. Statistics provided by the 
organization show a wide range of 
educational levels and occupations; my 
own observations suggest a center of 
gravity in the lower-middle class. But 
<pb n="482"/>
it is not only in its class composition 
that the Soka Gakkai is unusual, for it 
has a substantial percentage of African-
American, Latino, and Asian-American 
members, in addition to those of 
European-American ancestry. According to
 a 1983 survey, fully 55 percent of its 
members came from non-European ethnic 
backgrounds. In sum, in both class and 
ethnicity, its clientele stands in stark
 contrast to that of Elite Buddhist 
groups. A further contrast can be seen 
in the types of demands made on the 
practitioner, for membership in the Soka
 Gakkai involves no long retreats or 
training periods. The primary practice -
- chanting the mantra 'namu myoho renge 
kyo'-- can be done in one's own home 
rather than at a central meeting place 
and requires only a small commitment of 
time each day. On the other hand, an 
integral part of Soka Gakkai practice is
 spreading the teachings to others, 
which is seen as a way to change society
 for the better as well as to improve 
one's own karmic 'fortune.' Both of 
these practices can (and indeed should) 
be performed in the midst of society and
 not in retreat from it. As a result, 
working-class and middle-class Buddhists
<pb n="483"/>
 can carry out their religious duties 
without interrupting the pursuit of 
conventional occupations. Since these 
Buddhists view material conditions as 
the direct manifestation of one's 
spiritual state, and therefore as 
amenable to immediate change by the 
force of religious practice, it is 
hardly surprising that the Soka Gakkai 
has a strong appeal to those with 
significant material needs, including 
recent immigrants and African-Americans.
.. Small wonder, too, that Buddhists in 
this category commonly experience upward
 economic mobility. For Soka Gakkai 
members, in other words, there is no 
sharp break between the material and the
 spiritual."

<_-xa>Horizontal Escape</_-xa>; <_-xa>Pure 
Land School</_-xa>; <_-xa>Universal Method
</_-xa>; <_-xa>Sudden Teaching </_-xa>

See the following passage concerning the
 illustrious Ming dynasty Zen Master Han
-shan (1566-1623): "Han-shan did not 
write any commentary on the (two 
Amitabha Sutras), and it is not clear 
how he places (them) in the Hua-Yen (
Avatamsaka) classification scheme. On 
the one hand, he regards the Western 
Paradise as the most expedient land of 
the innumerable Hua-yen Pure Lands. On 
the other hand, he seems to have 
considered the Pure Land teaching as a 
<pb n="488"/>
special teaching that lies outside the 
usual scheme of classification." (Sung-
peng Hsu, A Buddhist Leader in Ming 
China, p.149.)

The special teaching of Pure Land is 
expressed by the metaphor of "horizontal
" vs. "vertical" escape. "Vertically" 
and "horizontally" are figures of speech
, which can readily be understood 
through the following example. Suppose 
we have a worm, born inside a stalk of 
bamboo. To escape, it can take the "hard
 way" and crawl all the way to the top 
of the stalk. Alternatively, it can look
 for or poke a hole near its current 
location and escape "horizontally" into 
the big, wide world. The horizontal 
escape, for sentient beings, is to seek 
rebirth in the Pure Land. Pure Land is 
considered a special method because its 
immediate goal is not Enlightenment but 
rebirth in the Land of Ultimate Bliss. 
The Pure Land is an ideal environment 
and training ground for the ultimate 
achievement of Buddhahood. 

Pure Land Buddhism: Perfect,
"Reciting the Buddha's name seeking 
rebirth in the Pure Land is a 'perfect 
<pb n="489"/>
sudden' method in the Mahayana tradition
, because .the cultivator takes 
Enlightenment in the 'effect stage' as 
his point of departure for awakening the
 mind in the 'causal stage.' If it were 
not taught by Buddha Sakyamuni Himself, 
who would believe that a common mortal 
of the 'Four Ways of Birth and Six Paths
' could reach the stage of non-
retrogression, equal to the higher level
 Bodhisattvas, thanks to Amitabha Buddha
's power of 'welcoming and escorting'? 
After all, cultivators following other 
methods would have to spend eons in 
diligent, continuous cultivation to 
obtain such results. With the Pure Land 
method, since the cultivator has put his
 faith in 'other-power' in addition to 
using all his 'self-power,' every single
 cultivator will be reborn in the Land 
of Ultimate Bliss, escape the cycle of 
Birth and Death and achieve non-
retrogression. If we were to use Buddha 
Recitation to discover the Mind-Ground 
and awaken to our Original Nature, the 
Pure Land method would be no different 
from other methods. However, when we 
rely on Buddha Recitation to seek 
rebirth in the Pure Land, this method 
has unique characteristics. Ancient 
<pb n="490"/>
masters have said: 
1. Birth (in the Pure Land) is 
definitely birth; however, return (to 
the Pure Land) is, in truth, no return. 
This is True Realization of realms, not 
of beings. 
2. Return is definitely return; however,
 birth is, in truth, No-Birth. This is 
True Realization of beings, not of 
realms. 
3. Return is, in reality, no return; 
birth is also, in truth, no birth. This 
is True Realization of both realms and 
beings. 
4. Return is definitely return; birth is
 definitely birth. This is not True 
Realization of realms and beings. 
These four statements explain the Four 
True Realizations of Pure Land teachings
. True Realization means thorough 
comprehension of essence, or noumenon. 
Since the whole Dharma Realm (cosmos) is
 only Mind, sentient beings and realms 
are illusory. If we conceive that there 
are sentient beings achieving rebirth in
 the Pure Land and that there are realms
 to go back to, we are still attached to
 beings and dharmas and are still making
 a distinction between here and there. 
This is not True Realization, i.e., not 
<pb n="491"/>
a complete understanding of essence and 
noumenon. The reverse is called True 
Realization. The ancients have 
summarized the idea in the following 
stanza: Recitation is equal to non-
recitation, No-Birth is Birth,/ (Having 
reached that stage) do not bother to 
move even half a step,/You have arrived 
at the Enlightened capital city. 
True Realization of beings and realms (
No. 3) is the ultimate goal of Pure Land
 practitioners. Nevertheless, the 
doctrine taught in the Three Pure Land 
Sutras and the Commentary on Rebirth is 
No. 4 ('not True Realization of realms 
and beings'), which is consonant with 
seeking rebirth in the Pure Land. This 
is because Buddha Sakyamuni knew that 
common mortals in this world of the Five
 Turbidities, especially in this Dharma-
Ending Age, would have heavy and deep 
karmic obstructions; establishing a 
realm of marks (the Pure Land), enabling
 them to anchor their minds and 
cultivate, would be difficult enough -- 
not to mention abandoning all marks! If 
common human beings of this Dharma-
Ending Age cultivate while grasping at 
marks (i.e., the Pure Land), their 
Practice and Vows will be more earnest 
<pb n="492"/>
and the final result of rebirth in the 
Pure land easier to achieve. Once reborn
 in the Pure Land, why worry about not 
attaining the state of No-Birth and No-
Mark?"

"Buddhism has had little difficulty in 
accommodating a large number of local 
beliefs concerning various gods, spirits
 and the like. Naturally the powers of 
such entities are circumscribed by the 
law of kamma (karma) and other laws. The
 Buddhist perceives the universe as vast
 enough to encompass many such entities.
 Numerous cults coexist with Buddhism --
 some barely tolerated, some irrelevant 
and ignored, some incorporated to a 
greater or lesser degree into the larger
 scene. Such cultic activities may play 
a considerable part in the life of the 
villager. There has been much discussion
 among scholars as to the precise 
<pb n="493"/>
relationship between Buddhism and such 
cults. Some see a supernatural hierarchy
 with the Buddha at the summit. Others 
contrast the 'great tradition' with the 
'little tradition.' The profane or 
secular level of spirit cults can be set
 against the superior sacred level of 
the Buddhist teaching. Many early 
European observers, followed by some 
Buddhist modernists, saw the existence 
of such cults as due to a corruption of 
the original 'pure' Buddhism. In actual 
fact Buddhism is not concerned with such
 matters. They are not rejected They are
 simply a different sphere of human 
activity. Provided there is no direct 
opposition to Buddhist teaching they can
 be left to regulate themselves. There 
is no inconsistency between believing in
 the law of kamma and at the same time 
making offerings to a deity to obtain 
some desired result. This is no 
different from asking aid of a king or 
doctor. Such aid is itself part of a 
complex set of relations and subject to 
various causes and conditions. The help 
given by a deity is a matter of fact or 
falsehood. So the striking contrast 
between the role of spirit cults in 
Buddhist villages and the tendency of 
<pb n="494"/>
Buddhist modernists to minimize or deny 
such elements is only superficially a 
problem. Contact with Western science 
often leads to the supposition that such
 spirits or deities do not exist. In 
that case, they are not a fact and can 
be discarded. Buddhism is committed to 
the notion that various entities and 
levels of being exist, but not to most 
particular names. In practice Buddhist 
traditionalists tend to be committed to 
at least a part of the local spirit cult
." 

"Buddhism does not deny the existence of
 good and evil spirits. There are 
visible and invisible beings or spirits 
in the same way as there are visible and
 invisible lights. We need special 
instruments to see the invisible light 
and we need a special sense to see the 
invisible beings. One cannot deny the 
existence of such spirits just because 
one is unable to see them with the naked
 eye. These spirits are also subject to 
birth and death. They are not going to 
stay permanently in the spirit form. 
They too exist in the same world where 
we live. A genuine Buddhist is one who 
molds his life according to moral 
<pb n="495"/>
causation discovered by the Buddha. He 
should not be concerned with the 
worshipping of these gods and spirits. 
However, this kind of worshipping is of 
some interest and fascination to the 
multitude and has naturally brought some
 Buddhists into contact with these 
activities. Regarding protection from 
evil spirits, goodness is a shield 
against evil. Goodness is a wall through
 which evil cannot penetrate unless the 
good person opens the door to an evil 
influence. Even though a person leads a 
truly virtuous and holy life and has a 
good shield of moral and noble living, 
that person can still lower his shield 
of protection by believing in the power 
of evil that would do him harm. The 
Buddha has never advised His followers 
to worship such spirits or to be 
frightened of them. The Buddhist 
attitude towards them is to transfer 
merits and to radiate loving-kindness (
and compassion) to them. Buddhists do 
not harm them. On the other hand, if a 
man is religious, virtuous and pure in 
mind, and if he is also intelligent and 
possesses strong will-power and 
understanding capacity, then such a 
person could be deemed to be much 
<pb n="496"/>
stronger than spirits. The evil spirits 
would keep away from him, while the good
 spirits would protect him."

Also called miraculous power. Includes,

clairvoyance, (2) clairaudience, (3) 
mental telepathy, (4) psychic travel, (5
) knowledge of past and future, (6) 
ending contamination." 
<pb n="497"/>

"Reciting mantras and sutras for the 
purpose of sowing merits and wisdom and 
eliminating evil karma and 
transgressions is all to the good. 
However, to be deluded and seek 
spiritual powers is to abandon the roots
 for the branches -- an error in 
judgement. If, furthermore, your mind is
 grasping, your understanding of the 
Dharma nebulous, your precept-keeping 
lax, your Bodhi Mind undeveloped and 
your discriminatory, win-lose mind 
raging unchecked, you will be exposed 
one day to demons that may drive you 
insane! If you want to obtain spiritual 
powers, you should first attain 
Enlightenment and Buddhahood. Once 
Buddhahood is attained, you will 
naturally have full spiritual powers. If
 you do not strive for the Way but 
merely seek spiritual powers, let us not
 even speak about whether anything can 
be gained. If you should attain anything
, it would become an impediment to the 
Way. For this reason, the Buddhas and 
Patriarchs have strictly prohibited this
 erroneous form of cultivation." 

NOTE:
<pb n="498"/>
"The reason why supernormal powers are 
not held in high esteem is that 
deliberate efforts to cultivate them 
would distract devotees from the 
infinitely more rewarding quest for 
Liberation. Furthermore, once such 
powers are acquired, they can be turned 
to profit and people wielding this means
 of gaining wealth and fame might be 
deflected from the quest altogether." 
During His lifetime, Buddha Sakyamuni 
discouraged the display of spiritual 
powers. Once, the story goes, He was 
waiting at the river's edge for a boat 
to take him across. An ascetic, passing 
by, showed off his spiritual powers, 
crossing the river back and forth by 
treading over the water. The Buddha then
 asked him, "How long did it take you to
 acquire such powers?" "Thirty years," 
was the reply. The Buddha then said, "
Thirty years of effort? Well, I can 
cross the river for a five-cent fare." 
It may be added that for a person still 
subject to excessive greed, anger, and 
delusion to have access to unusual 
powers could be harmful to himself and 
dangerous to society at large. (Note: 
there are several versions of this story
).

John Snelling, The Elements of Buddhism,

expedient to help his chosen disciple 
achieve a Great Awakening. He decided to
 drive the younger monk out of his 
complacency through an elaborate plan to
 "frame" him as a thief in disguise. The
 disciple was then denounced to one and

monk, once the teacher of a huge 
congregation, now completely debased and
 with nowhere to turn, his ego totally 
shattered, mulled over this flagrant

injustice and at times even contemplated
 suicide. After several weeks of utter 
desperation, he suddenly experienced a 
Great Awakening: life is a dream, an 
illusion, a bubble, a shadow. This is

impart to the novices for so many years!
 He then rushed to the Master, who upon

<_-xa>Cause and Effect</_-xa>

This is a reference to a well-known 
story about Buddha Sakyamuni's disciple 
Visakha, who once said: "When a certain 
Bhikkhu was standing at the door for 
alms, my father-in-law was eating sweet 
milk rice-porridge, ignoring him. 
Thinking to myself that my father-in-law
, without performing any good deed in 
this life, is only consuming the merits 
of past deeds, I told the Bhikkhu: 'Pass
 on Venerable Sir, my father-in-law is 
eating stale fare." (Narada, The Buddha 
and His Teachings, p.101.) 

Most people go through life consuming "
stale fare," as they enjoy the results 
of their past merits without thought of 
creating new ones. For example, a 
wealthy person (i.e., one who practiced 
charity in past lives) spending time and
 money on himself alone, without 
thoughts of charity, is eating stale 
fare. This concept is also related to 
the idea that merits accrued in the 
first lifetime are potential enemies of 
the third lifetime. In the first 
lifetime, the practitioner engages in 
<pb n="507"/>
wholesome actions which bring blessings 
(wealth, power, authority, etc.) in the 
second lifetime. Since wealth and power 
tend to corrupt, he is likely to create 
evil karma, resulting in retribution in 
the third lifetime. Thus the Buddha's 
injunction against seeking rebirth 
within Samsara.

 or progression through various stages

NOTE:
"In his commentary on the Pure Land

Pure Land as an sudden (abrupt) teaching
 that also shares some aspects of the '
final' teaching of the Lotus Sutra and 
the perfect (round) doctrine of the 
Avatamsaka Sutra. It belongs to the 
sudden doctrine, he says, because the 
<pb n="513"/>
Pure Land devotee 'attains rebirth in 
the Western Paradise as soon as he 
relies on the Buddha's name.' Chu-hung 
explains that the mind of the devotee of
 Buddha-recitation, when this is 
properly done, is a mind without any 
disturbance and is equivalent to the 
mind of no-thought spoken of in the Zen 
school. Like Han-shan, Chu-hung 
interprets Pure Land teaching in the Zen
 spirit, but at the same time advocates 
the more traditional and devotional 
aspects of the Pure Land faith. For both
 men, the other-power religion that 
teaches salvation by faith and Amitabha'
s grace is wedded to the self-power 
religion that teaches salvation by self-
realization."

<xa>SUDHODANA</xa>
<_-xa>Sakyamuni Buddha</_-xa>

"Father of Gotama (Buddha Sakyamuni). 
Suddhodana was a chieftain of the Indian
 Sakya tribe. His wife was Maya, who 
died 7 days after giving birth to Gotama
. It was predicted of the child Gotama 
by soothsayers that he would become 
either a universal monarch or a Buddha. 
Suddhodana, therefore, sought to protect
 the boy from any experience of 
unpleasant aspects of life, such as 
illness, old age and death, and to 
surround him with pleasures. In spite of
 this protection, Gotama is said to have
 seen in one day a disease-ridden man, 
an old man, and a corpse, and thus to 
have been brought to reflection upon the
<pb n="515"/>
 meaning of phenomenal human existence. 
When news of Gotama's having attained 
enlightenment reached Suddhodana, he 
sent messengers inviting the Buddha to 
come to Kapilavastu. The messengers, 
however, hearing Buddha preach, were 
converted and entered the Sangha without
 delivering their message. This happened
 repeatedly until the tenth time, when 
the message reached Buddha. On his 
visiting Kapilavastu and conversing with
 Suddhodana, the latter became a 
soptapanna (a sage). Some years later, 
when Suddhodana was dying, the Buddha 
visited him. After hearing the Buddha's 
discourse, Suddhodana became a lay Arhat
, and died soon after."

<xa>SUFISM</xa>
<_-xa>Pure Land Buddhism (summary)</_-xa>

"An Islamic mystical movement which 
<pb n="516"/>
represents a move away from the 
legalistic approach in Islam to a more 
personal relationship with God. The word
 comes from suf ('wool'), because the 
early story-tellers from whom Sufism 
evolved wore woollen garments. Sufis aim
 to lose themselves in the ultimate 
reality of the Divinity by constant 
repetition of the dhikr or 'repetition 
of the name of God or of a sacred 
formula'... Although their main purpose 
is to increase mystical awareness of God
, they also performed an important 
missionary function, especially on the 
fringes of the Muslim world in places 
such as Central Asia, India, the Sudan 
and West Africa." 

The Sufis are a mystic Islamic sub-
school that seems to resemble Buddhism 
in several respects. However the basic 
belief systems are entirely different, 
Islam being based on an all-powerful God
 while Buddhism revolves around the Law 
of Cause and Effect. In the case of Pure
 Land Buddhism, Amitabha Buddha 
ultimately is our Self-Nature. To return
 to the Pure Land is to return to our 
own Pure Mind (Self-Nature Amitabha, 
Mind-Only Pure Land).

<xa>SUICIDE</xa>
<_-xa>Immolation</_-xa>; <_-xa>Killing殺生</_-xa>

"According to Buddhist doctrine a man 
cannot avoid suffering by taking his 
life, nor does he escape from the 'Wheel
 of Life' by so doing. The destruction 
of the physical body merely transfers 
the entity to other spheres of existence
, and rebirth into the physical follows.
 Physical life is considered of great 
importance, as it is only here that the 
Way of Liberation can be followed, and 
Enlightenment attained. Taking one's 
life is therefore, a waste of 
opportunity. Voluntary sacrifice of one'
s life for the welfare of others is 
considered meritorious, the motive being
 altruistic." 

<pb n="518"/>
According to Buddhist teachings, all 
suffering derives from past evil karma. 
To attempt to escape suffering through 
suicide is no different from a dog 
trying to free itself by gnawing its 
leash. Its master will immediately 
punish the dog and replace the leash 
with a stronger one. Likewise, the 
person who commits suicide cannot escape
 suffering (because he has not altered 
its cause -- his mind). In fact, he will
 surely be reborn under worse conditions
, as a result of the extreme anger and 
frustration that led him to suicide in 
the first place.

Bliss</_-xa>

 <_-xa>Pure Lands (as Realms);Three Pure 
Land Sutras</_-xa>

"Skt., lit 'the Blissful'; the so-called
 Western Paradise, the Pure Land of the 
West, one of the most important of the 
<pb n="519"/>
Buddha-fields to appear in the Mahayana.
 It is reigned over by Buddha Amitabha, 
who created it by his karmic merit. 
Through faithful devotion to Amitabha 
and through recitation of his name, one 
can be reborn there and cultivate until 
entering final Nirvana. Sukhavati is 
described in detail in the sutras 
devoted to Amitabha. Sukhavati is set in
 the west. It is flooded by radiance (
light/ q.v.) that emanates from Amitabha
 ... In this buddha-field all beings 
cleave to the truth of the teaching 
until their final entry into Nirvana. 
Their supreme happiness is hearing the 
teaching proclaimed by Amitabha, who 
lives in the center of the land and is 
accompanied by Avalokitesvara and 
Mahasthamaprapta." 

"Sukhavati means 'endowed with happiness
'; Amitabha's land is so called because 
those living there are free of 
afflictions and enjoy the supreme bliss 
of Nirvana. His land, usually called '
the Pure Land,' is the reward for the 
long course of practice which he 
performed when he was a Bodhisattva 
called 'Dharmakara' (Dharma-store). 
Although its glorious splendour is 
<pb n="520"/>
described in physical terms in the 
sutras, this land is above all forms and
 concepts. It is the sphere of pure 
spiritual activity; those born there are
 awakened to the ultimate reality, and 
compassion spontaneously arises in them.
 In other words, having become 
Bodhisattvas, they participate in 
Amitabha's endless work of delivering 
beings from delusions and sufferings." 

"According to the Pure Land sutras ... 
Sukhavati lies billions of Buddha lands 
away from our Saha World-realm. The 
Buddha Amitabha is the transcendent 
Buddha who presides over the Sukhavati 
world-realm... According to the Larger 
Sukhavativyuha (Longer Amitabha Sutra), 
Amitabha established Sukhavati through 
his compassionate vows in order to lead 
sentient beings to Buddhahood. He made 
the vows as a Bodhisattva, named 
Dharmakara, and after five Kalpas (eons)
 of contemplation his vows were 
consummated. For the past ten Kalpas, 
Buddha Amitabha has dwelled in Sukhavati
 and has continuously preached the 
Dharma..." (Kenneth K. Tanaka, The Dawn 
of Chinese Pure Land Buddhism Doctrine.)

<pb n="521"/>
"Question/ Answer
The Western Pure Land is ten billion 
Buddha-lands away from here. Common, 
ordinary people are weak and frail. How 
can they reach it? ... Answer: The 
Western Pure Land is described as being 
ten billion Buddha-lands away from here 
only with respect to the limited 
concepts of ordinary people with eyes of
 flesh and blood, mired in Birth and 
Death. For those who have attained the 
pure karma of rebirth in the Pure Land, 
the Mind in samadhi at the time of death
 is precisely the Mind reborn in the 
Pure Land. As soon as the thought (of 
rebirth) arises, rebirth is achieved. 
Thus, the Meditation Sutra states that '
the Land of Amitabha Buddha is not far 
from here!' Moreover, the power of karma
 is inconceivable. In the space of one 
thought, rebirth in the Pure Land is 
achieved. There is no need to worry 
about distance. This is analogous to a 
person asleep and dreaming. Although his
 body is on the bed, his Mind is 
travelling all over, to all worlds, as 
though he were awake. Rebirth in the 
Pure Land is, generally speaking, 
similar to this example." (Tien T'ai

Mount Sumeru</_-xa>; <_-xa>Meru</_-xa>

"The mythical 'world mountain' that 
rises through the center of a Buddhist 
universe." 

"A mountain thought to stand at the 
center of the world, according to 
ancient Indian tradition. It is said to 
measure 84,000 yojana above the surface 
of the sea and 84,000 yojana below, and 
to be composed of gold, silver, emerald 
and crystal, with four sides facing 
north, south, east and west respectively
. The god Indra resides on the summit, 
while the Four Heavenly Kings live 
halfway down the four sides. Mt. Sumeru 
is surrounded by seven concentric 
mountain ranges made of gold, between 
which are seven perfumed seas. The 
seventh gold mountain range is 
surrounded by a salt ocean, in which are
<pb n="523"/>
 the four continents of Purvavideha, 
Aparagodaniya, Uttarakura and Jambudvipa
, lying respectively to the east, west, 
north and south. The salt ocean is in 
turn bounded by a circular range of iron
 mountains which stands at the rim of 
the world. A sun and a moon move around 
Mt. Sumeru." 

In Buddhist cosmology, the universe is 
composed of worlds upon worlds, ad 
infinitum. (Our earth is only an 
infinitesimal part of one of these 
countless worlds). The Polar Mountain is
 the central mountain of each world.

<xa>SUPPORTIVE</xa>
<_-xa>Death</_-xa>; <_-xa>Buddha Recitation
</_-xa>; <_-xa>Pure Land School</_-xa>

<pb n="527"/>
Vn/ Ho-Niem. Supportive Recitation is 
recitation performed by one or more Pure
 Land practitioners alongside a dying 
person, to assist him in achieving 
rebirth in the Pure Land. This is 
important for Pure Land practitioners as
 at the time of death, one is like a 
turtle being skinned alive. Filled with 
pain and fear, without the support of 
like-minded practitioners, one is likely
 to forget about Buddha Recitation and 
Pure Land rebirth.

(I) GENERAL Guidelines
"In general, the spiritual advisor, 
should follow the guidelines set out 
below.

l. Remind the patient of the sufferings 
of the Saha World and the joys of the 
Pure Land, so that he may develop a mind
 of devotion and attraction to the Pure 
Land. The good advisor should also 
enumerate and praise the patient's good 
deeds, merits and virtues in cultivation
. This will make him happy and free of 
doubts, certain that when the time comes
 to die, he will, thanks to his good 
deeds, be reborn in the Pure Land. 
2. If the patient has any doubts, the 
<pb n="528"/>
advisor should, depending on the 
circumstances, explain the Three Points 
of Doubts and the Four Narrow Passes. A 
critical detail to bear in mind here: 
the dying person should be reminded to 
eliminate all regret over wealth and 
property, as well as attachment to close
 family and relatives. 
3. If the patient has a will, so much 
the better, but if not, the advisor 
should counsel against all inquiries in 
this regard. He should also advise 
everyone to refrain from useless chit-
chat that could rekindle the patient's 
love-attachment to the world, which is 
detrimental to rebirth in the Pure Land.
 
4. When relatives and friends come to 
visit, they should be discouraged from 
standing before the patient inquiring 
about his health in a sad, piteous way. 
If they come out of true concern, they 
should merely stand on the side, 
reciting the Buddha's name aloud for a 
moment. If, lacking understanding of the
 Dharma, the visitors act conventionally
 (crying, etc.), they are in effect 
pushing the dying person into the ocean 
of suffering -- a most regrettable 
occurrence indeed! 
<pb n="529"/>
5. The patient should be counselled to 
practice charity and give away his 
personal effects to the needy. Or, 
better still, in accordance with the 
Ksitigarbha (Earth Store Bodhisattva) 
Sutra, he should use the proceeds from 
the sale of his personal possessions to 
purchase Buddhist images or sutras for 
free distribution. All this helps the 
patient increase his stock of merits and
 eliminate bad karma, thus facilitating 
rebirth in the Pure Land. The good 
advisor should keep these general 
guidelines in mind, but be ready to 
improvise according to the situation. 

(II) Conducting 'Supportive Recitation':
 
Family members and relatives of a dying 
patient should remain calm, without 
weeping or lamenting, from the time he 
becomes gravely ill until his last 
moments. Some people, while not crying, 
still show sorrow and emotion on their 
faces. This, too, should be avoided, 
because, at this juncture, the dying 
person has reached the crossroads which 
separate the living from the dead, and 
the mundane from the transcendental. The
 critical importance and danger of this 
<pb n="530"/>
moment can be compared to standing under
 a sword -- his fate is determined by a 
hair's breadth! At this time, the most 
important thing is to practice 
supportive recitation. Even though a 
person may have set his mind on rebirth 
in the Pure Land, if family members weep
 and lament, thus arousing deep-seated 
feelings of love-attachment, he will 
certainly sink into the cycle of Birth 
and Death, wasting all his efforts in 
cultivation! When a patient on the verge
 of death wishes to bathe, dress in 
different garments, or change his 
position or sleeping quarters, we may 
comply, while exercising caution and 
acting in a gentle, careful manner at 
all times. If the patient refuses, or 
cannot give his consent because he has 
become mute, we certainly should not go 
against his wishes. This is because the 
patient on the verge of death is 
generally in great physical pain. If he 
is forced to move, bathe or change 
clothing, he may experience even greater
 pain. There are numerous cases of 
cultivators who had sought rebirth in 
the Pure Land but failed to achieve this
 goal because their relatives moved them
 around, disturbing them and destroying 
<pb n="531"/>
their right thought. This unfortunate 
development occurs very often ... At the
 time of death, the cultivator himself 
should either lie down or sit up, 
according to what comes naturally, 
without forcing himself. If he feels 
weak and can only lie down, forcing 
himself to sit up, for appearances' sake
, is dangerous and should be discouraged
. Likewise, even though, according to 
Pure Land tradition, he should lie on 
his right side facing west, if, because 
of pain, he can only lie on his back or 
on his left side facing east, he should 
act naturally and not force himself. The
 patient and his family should 
understand all this and act accordingly.
 Supportive recitation by family members
 or Dharma friends is most necessary 
when a patient is on the verge of death.
 This is because, at that time, he is 
weak in body and mind and no longer 
master of himself. In such trying 
circumstances, not only is it difficult 
for those who have not cultivated in 
daily life to focus on Amitabha Buddha, 
even individuals who have regularly 
recited the Buddha's name may find it 
difficult to do so in all earnestness --
 unless there is supportive recitation. 
<pb n="532"/>
Such recitation should closely follow 
the guidelines set out below: 
1. Respectfully place a standing 
Amitabha Buddha statue in front of the 
patient, so that he can see it clearly. 
Place some fresh flowers in a vase and 
burn light incense with a soft fragrance
. This will help the patient develop 
right thought. A reminder: the incense 
should not be overpowering, to avoid 
choking the patient and everyone around.
 
2. Those who come to practice supportive
 recitation should take turns ... It 
should be remembered that the patient, 
in his weakened state, requires a lot of
 fresh air to breathe. If too many 
people come and go or participate in the
 recitation session, the patient may 
have difficulty breathing and become 
agitated, resulting in more harm than 
benefit. Therefore, participants should 
consult their watches and silently take 
turns reciting, so that recitation can 
continue uninterrupted. They should not 
call to one another aloud. Each session 
should last about an hour. 
3. According to Elder Master Yin Kuang, 
the short recitation form (Amitabha 
Buddha) should be used, so that the 
<pb n="533"/>
patient can easily register the name in 
his Alaya consciousness, at a time when 
both his mind and body are very weak. 
However, according to another Elder 
Master, we should ask the patient and 
use the form he prefers (short or long),
 to conform to his everyday practice. In
 this way, the patient can silently 
recite along with the supportive 
recitation party. To go counter to his 
likes and habits may destroy his right 
thought and create an offense on our 
part. Furthermore, we should not 
practice supportive recitation in too 
loud a voice, as we will expend too much
 energy and be unable to keep on for 
very long. On the other hand, neither 
should we recite in too low a voice, 
lest the patient, in his weakened state,
 be unable to register the words. 
Generally speaking, recitation should 
not be too loud or too low, too slow or 
too fast. Each utterance should be clear
 and distinct so that it can pass 
through the ear and penetrate deep into 
the patient's Alaya consciousness. One 
caveat: if the patient is too weak (or 
is in a coma), he will not be able to 
hear "external" recitation. In such a 
case, we should recite into the patient'
<pb n="534"/>
s ear. This helps the patient keep his 
mind clear and steady. 
4. With regard to percussion instruments
, it is generally better to use the 
small hand bell, instead of the wooden 
fish gong with its bass tone. The hand 
bell, with its clear, limpid sound, can 
help the patient develop a pure and calm
 mind. However, this may not apply in 
all cases. For instance, an Elder Master
 once taught, "It is best to recite the 
Buddha's name by itself without musical 
accompaniment, but since each person's 
preferences are different, it is better 
to ask the patient in advance. If some 
details do not suit him, we should adapt
 to the circumstances and not be 
inflexible. The above are some pointers 
to keep in mind with regard to 
supportive recitation." 

NOTE: 
To be truly effective in dedicating 
merit to others, the practitioner must 
be utterly sincere and singleminded in 
his recitation. Even if he is, the 
Ksitigarbha Sutra teaches that the 
deceased can only receive a small part 
of this merit. Furthermore, since the 
auricle conditions of sincerity and 
<pb n="535"/>
singlemindedness are seldom achieved in 
full, most intercessions are, at best, 
partially effective and can seldom erase
 a lifetime of bad karma. Thus, it is 
imperative for the practitioner himself 
to cultivate during his lifetime and not
 rely on family members, monks or nuns 
at the time of death.

<xa>SURANGAMA</xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Heroic Gate Sutra</_-xa>
<_-xa>Mahasthamaprapta</_-xa>

Chin/ Leng-Yen Ching; Vn/ Thu-Lang-
Nghiem Kinh Also called the Sutra of the
 Heroic One; exercised a great influence
 on the development of Mahayana Buddhism
 in China (and neighboring countries). "
It emphasized the power of samadhi, 
through which enlightenment can be 
attained, and explains the various 
methods of emptiness meditation through 
the practice of which everyone can 
realize enlightenment." (Shambhala 
Dictionary of Buddhism and Zen.)

"This sutra was brought to China by the 
great Indian monk Paramartha about 717, 
and translated by him into Chinese with 
the aid of Wang Yung, formerly a 
Minister of State. This work took about 
two years. It angered the Emperor that 
this had been done without first 
securing the permission of the 
Government, so Wang Yung was punished 
and Paramartha was forced to return with
 his manuscript to India. No one knows 
<pb n="537"/>
how the Chinese translation of the Sutra
 was preserved. In the course of time,
however, it came to be tremendously 
valued by Chinese Buddhists and Taoists 
as in it Buddha describes the steps to 
be taken and the meditation to be 
undertaken to reach the great 
Enlightenment -- describing the 
tranquilizing of the mind by exclusion 
of concepts arising directly and 
indirectly from sensory experiences, the
 nature of the Truth realized in the 
samadhi or deepest contemplation, and 
the transcendental virtues and powers 
resulting. Finally, it treats of the 
highest perfect wisdom, Anuttara-Samyak-
Sambodhi." 

(I) Zen Buddhism
"The Method of Hearing (expounded by the
 Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara in the 
Surangama Sutra) is in keeping with the 
fundamental principle that if one sense-
organ is intensely concentrated, all the
 other five sense-organs would be also 
held still automatically. This is the 
most fundamental tenet of the reciting 
method, as said in the Surangama Sutra: 
"when the six sense-organs (five senses 
plus mind) are simultaneously held in 
<pb n="538"/>
concentration, there will be every pure 
thought in succession." (Hsu Heng Chi, 
What's Buddhism: 56.)

(II)Pure Land Buddhism
"The Surangama Sutra (in the section 
describing the method of cultivation of 
Mahastamaprapta Bodhisattva) states: "
Moreover whoever recites the name of the
 Amitabha Buddha, whether in the present
 time, or in future time, will surely
<_-xa>the Buddha Amitabha and never 
become separated from him. By reason of 
that association, just as one 
associating with the maker of perfumes 
becomes permeated with the same perfumes
, so he will become perfumed by Amitabha
's compassion, and will become 
enlightened without any other expedient 
means." (A Buddhist Bible) Goddard: 245 
The Surangama Sutra is a key text for Ch
'an/Zen practitioners, while the section
 referring to the Pure Land practices of
 the Bodhisattva Mahasthamaprapta is 
sometimes classified as the fifth Pure 
Land text. </_-xa>



<xa>SUTRA</xa>
<pb n="539"/>
<_-xa>Scriptural Recital</_-xa>

"Lit. a thread on which jewels are 
strung. Applied to that part of the 
Canon containing the dialogues or 
discourses of the Buddha." 

"A preaching of the Buddha as recorded 
in documents. In the early stages of 
Buddhist history, sutras were memorized,
 and only in later times were they 
written down." 

"The sutras have been preserved in Pali 
and Sanskrit, as well as in Chinese and 
Tibetan translations. According to 
tradition they derive directly from the 
Buddha.

The sutras are prose texts, each 
introduced by the words 'Thus have I 
heard.' These words are ascribed to 
Ananda, a disciple of the Buddha. He is 
supposed to have retained the discourses
 of the Buddha in memory and to have 
recited them at the first Buddhist 
council, immediately after the death of 
the Buddha. After these introductory 
words, the circumstances that occasioned
 the Buddha to give the discourse are 
<pb n="540"/>
described, as well as the place, the 
time of year, etc. Then the actual 
instruction follows, sometimes in the 
form of a dialogue. 
The style of the sutras is simple, 
popular, and didactically oriented. They
 are rich in parables and allegories. In
 many sutras, songs (gatha) are 
interpolated. Each sutra constitutes a 
self-sufficient unit. As for content, 
two currents of tradition can be 
recognized in Mahayana sutras: 
l. Sutras based on faith, which treat 
buddhology and Bodhisattva teaching and 
stress devotion. In these sutras, no 
bounds are set to the imagination, 
buddhas and Bodhisattvas performing 
countless miracles in limitless space 
and endless time. They are elevated to 
the level of divine beings, a tendency 
in the Mahayana that arises from its 
nature with its doctrines of non-
substantiality and emptiness (shunyata),
 which come to expression in a view that
 sees the world as illusory (maya). In 
such a view, all miracles, like the 
world of appearance itself, are no more 
than a product of illusion. 
2. Philosophically-oriented sutras that 
have as their theme emptiness, the 
<pb n="541"/>
central notion of the Mahayana. They 
have been differently interpreted by 
Mahayana thinkers and this has provided 
the impetus for the formation of various
 schools. The most important independent
 sutras are Lankavatara sutra, Sukhavati
-Vyuha Sutra (Amitabha sutra), 
Dashabhumika, Brahma Net Sutra, 
Amitayurdhyana sutra (Meditation Sutra),
 Vimalakirti sutra, Surangama Sutra." 
NOTES:
Although most sutras are preached by the
 Buddhas, there are instances where the 
words of Bodhisattvas are recorded as 
sutras. A case in point is the 
Avatamsaka Sutra, chapter 40, where the 
Buddha merely signifies His approval at 
the end with the words "Sadhu, sadhu" ("
Good indeed, good indeed"). 

"In some sutras, although the Buddha is 
present, he stays in the background and 
one of his disciples speaks, in which 
case the text ends with the Buddha 
giving the approval to what the disciple
 has said, thus making the discourse his
 own, as it were. Sometimes, especially 
in Mahayana sutras, it is not even a 
question of the Buddha giving his 
approval. A disciple may be doing the 
<pb n="542"/>
actual speaking, but he speaks under the
 direct inspiration of the Buddha, so 
that in truth the Buddha is speaking 
through him. But however it is spoken, 
it is important to understand that 
whatever is said in the body of a sutra 
is not just issuing from the ordinary 
level of consciousness. It isn't 
something that has been worked out 
intellectually. It isn't a proof or an 
explanation of something in the mundane 
sense. It is truth, a message, even a 
revelation, issuing from the depths of 
the Enlightened consciousness, the 
depths of the Buddha nature. This is the
 essential content of any Buddhist 
scripture, and this is its purpose: to 
communicate the nature of Enlightenment 
and show the way leading to its 
realization." 



<xa>SUTRA</xa>
"The first sutra to be translated into 
Chinese. The Ssu-Shih-Erh-Chang Ching (
Vn/Tu Thap Nhi Chuong) is said to have 
been brought to the court by emissaries 
of Emperor Ming-ti who were searching 
for Buddhist scriptures in ... Central 
<pb n="543"/>
Asia, and to have been translated in the
 year 67 A.D. by the Indian monks 
Matanga and Chu-fa-lan.

In this sutra, which was also the first 
Buddhist written work in the Chinese 
language, the essential teachings of the
 Lesser Vehicle, such as impermanence 
and desire or craving, are explained. 
Many versions of this sutra are extant;
they differ considerably in places."

devotional form of worship. Dr. D.T. 
Sukzuki strongly believed that the

"Famous modern Chinese Buddhist monk. 
Organized revival of Buddhism in China 
between the World Wars. Founded Chinese 
Buddhist Association and the journal Hai
 Cha'o Yin (the Voice of the Tide). 
Travelled in Europe 1928-9 where he 
founded Les Amis du Bouddhisme in Paris.
<pb n="548"/>
 Worked hard to improve relations 
between Buddhists of the East and West. 
Sole work in English translation, 
Lectures in Buddhism, a booklet 
published in Paris,1928." 

"His main doctrinal theme focused on 
promoting a synthesis of various Chinese
 Buddhist schools in a harmonious 
fashion. The reform movement that 
flourished as a result of the work of T'
ai Hsu (and others) was cut short by the
 take-over of the mainland by the 
Chinese Communists in 1949." 

"In the summer of 1922, disciples of the
 famous Chinese monk T'ai Hsu journeyed 
from Shanghai to Chengtu in Szechuan 
Province to bring the modernized message
 of Buddhism as taught by their master. 
Their coming was the occasion of great 
rejoicing, and a real revival of 
Buddhism was the result. They had been 
heralded for more than a year and their 
way prepared by a wide circulation of T'
ai Hsu's popular magazine Hai Ch'ao Yin 
--'The Voice of the Sea,' or 'The Sound 
of the Tide.' Very carefully edited 
articles had prepared the people for the
 visit of the missionaries, and the new 
<pb n="549"/>
message found a ready response even 
before their arrival. It brought a 
message of peace for the troubled days, 
and the magazine clearly stated that the
 new message was destined to lift the 
sublime teachings of the Mahayana 
Doctrine for the help of the people 
tossed about in a sea of modern doubt. 
The message was essentially spiritual 
and taught, or stood for, three 
propositions, (1) a real desire to 
reform monasticism, (2) a plan to 
reconstruct Buddhist theology along 
lines of modern philosophy, and (3) to 
use the teachings of Buddha to elevate 
the people and improve social conditions
. The missionaries were officially 
welcomed by the Governor of the Province
. Sixteen daily papers all joined in and
 gave columns to the new teaching, thus 
supplying a liberal supply of 
advertising. The opening meetings were 
attended by large crowds who listened 
attentively to the new program, and 
large numbers enrolled for the daily 
course to be given. In fact, a real 
program was gotten out, much like a 
university course, or a summer school 
curriculum, and fees charged for the 
course. Then daily the large hall in the
<pb n="550"/>
 Public Garden of the Manchu City was 
thronged with auditors to hear the 
public addresses, and the classrooms 
were filled with eager students. A 
course in the history of Buddhism was 
given, what it had done for the world, 
and how it had become encrusted with 
many superstitions. Now all was changed.
 The old simple story of the Enlightened
 One and how he found the way of 
salvation was declared. Idolatry was 
opposed -in bygone days it was only 
tolerated as an accommodation to the 
weakness of ignorant people. Now 
education was to be stressed. A Buddhist
 university was to be established. The 
monks were to be encouraged to be busy 
as learners and servants of the people. 
The mercy of Buddha was taught and 
enjoined so that the wicked might be led
 to kindness, the selfish to 
righteousness, and the hungry to find 
satisfaction in the doctrine. Most 
emphasized were the daily hours for 
fasting and meditation. A real revival 
was effected along the lines, and many 
of the foremost business and 
professional men took the vows and 
followed the course of meditation 
regularly. Many men who had not been 
<pb n="551"/>
interested in religion came under the 
sway of the new-found faith, and 
personally told me of the value of the 
hours of meditation and how their faith 
had been strengthened. The course on 
reading was followed widely. The 
students burnt incense daily as they 
read and meditated. At the meetings 
singing was indulged in, and often tunes
 quite similar to Christian tunes were 
used, and one song used with the refrain
, 'Take the name of Buddha with you.' 
They even organized a Young Men's 
Buddhist Association which is going 
strong. (A.J. Brace, YMCA secretary in 
Cheng-Tu, China)."

<xa>TANG</xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Tang Dynasty</_-xa>

"Also spelled 'Tang'. After the Han, 
generally regarded the most glorious of 
Chinese dynasties." 
<pb n="552"/>

"Period of Chinese history from 618-906,
 during which time Buddhism in China 
reached its peak of importance. By the 
time of the T'ang Dynasty, nearly all of
 the Buddhist schools were represented 
on Chinese soil: San-lun, Fa-hsiang, T'
ien-t'ai, Hua-yen, Ch'an, and Ching-t'u 
(Pure Land). During the T'ang Dynasty 
they took on a fully Chinese character. 
Buddhism was aggressively supported by a
 number of T'ang rulers, resulting in 
the development of monasteries, cave 
temple projects, and the like. 
Unfortunately, in about 845, Buddhism 
was severely persecuted by the Emperor T
'ang Wu-tsung. Despite the emperor's 
death the following year, an enormous 
number of monks and nuns were laicized, 
monastic property was seized, images 
were melted down, and the economic base 
of the Chinese Buddhist sangha was 
throughly disrupted. Those Buddhist 
schools that were either textual, 
intellectual, or totally monastery-based
 essentially perished from the landscape
, while the traditions that were based 
on personal, individual practice, 
especially including the Ch'an and the 
Pure Land traditions, survived (and 
<pb n="553"/>
thrived to this day)." 
"The Dharma was the pride of T'ang 
Buddhism. From the founding of the 
dynasty (618) to the An Lu-shun revolt (
755), a succession of great minds and 
the schools they championed laid a 
philosophical foundation for the future 
of Mahayana Buddhism. These schools--T'
ien-t'ai, Hua> yen, Pure Land, and Ch an
--can also be seen as bringing to 
maturity different forms of piety, 
stretching back to Indian origins. It is
 hard enough to see any unity to 
Mahayana in India, much less to discern 
a teleological structure in Sinitic 
Mahayana. Yet the emergence of these 
four schools was not a fortuitous event,
 but accorded with the four optimal 
poles in Mahayana Buddhology. Buddhas 
could be either laukika or lokottara (
mundane or transmundane), oriented to 
either prajna or karuna (wisdom or 
compassion)... Early Buddhism knew only 
the "historic didactic" Sakyamuni Buddha
. The idealization of the Buddha began 
within the Mahasamghika school, which 
marked the shift from the historical to 
the transhistorical. It was with 
Mahayana that (transcendental, salvific 
Buddhas such as Amitabha) emerged; 
<pb n="554"/>
compassion was given equal status with 
wisdom in a host of new salvific Buddhas
 and Bodhisattvas. A total 
rehumanization of the Buddha was 
accomplished in East Asia."

who was a fanatical follower of Taoism. 
At the urging of his Taoist advisors, he
 promulgated a series of anti-Buddhist 
decrees. This persecution of Buddhism 
reached its peak in 845: 260,000 
Buddhist monks and nuns were forced to 
return to worldly life. The art 
treasures of 4,600 monasteries were 
confiscated, and even Buddhist families 
had to surrender their ritual articles 
to imperial functionaries. This was the 
most effective persecution of Buddhism (

 to encounter the same treatment."

"A major school of Buddhism founded by 
the Great Teacher Chih I in China during
 the Sui dynasty (589-618). The school 
adopted a system of comparative 
classification which organized all the 
Buddhist sutras into Five Periods and 
Eight Teachings (q.v.) to clarify their 
relative position, and concludes that 
the true teaching of Buddhism is the 
<pb n="556"/>
unification of the three truths 
indicated in the Lotus Sutra. 
Enlightenment, the school maintains, is 
achieved by meditation to 'observe one's
 mind' or perceive the truth within one'
s own life." 

"The school teaches that a phenomenon 
can be viewed in three different ways 
within the same instant. First, because 
a phenomenon is produced by various 
causes, its essence is devoid of any 
permanent existence, that is, it is '
empty'. Second, nevertheless it does 
have a real, if only temporary, 
immediate existence ('false'). Third, 
since a phenomenon is thus a blending of
 both ultimate emptiness and temporary 
existence, it should be seen as 
occupying a position midway between the 
two poles ('Middle Way')." 

NOTES: A major school that takes the 
Lotus Sutra as its principal text. 
Historically, it has had a close 
relationship with Pure Land. Indeed, 
according to the famous master T'ai-Hsu 
(q.v.), the Longer Amitabha Sutra is a 
shorter form of the Lotus Sutra.

"A Picture of the Pure Land of Amitabha 
preserved in Taima-dera in Nara 
prefecture (Japan). The writing on this 
picture says that it is made of lotus 
threads." 

The Taima mandala, the most complex of 
the three Pure Land mandalas, derives in
<pb n="558"/>
 part from various illustrations based 
on two sutras, the Longer Amitabha Sutra
 and the Amitabha Sutra. Added to these 
influences, however, is the overwhelming
 impact of concepts such as the Sixteen 
Contemplations, taught in the Meditation
 Sutra. For this reason, the Taima 
mandala ought properly to be called a 
Meditation Sutra. It is popularly called
 the Taima mandala after the temple, the
 Taima-dera, where the original mandala,
 a tapestry of silk thread, is found.
The legend concerning the origin of the 
original Taima mandala is well known. It
 is found in various records as well as 
in the textual portions of the famous 
thirteenth-century narrative scroll 
painting the Legends of the Taima 
Mandala, in Komyo-ji in Kanagawa 
Prefecture (Japan). Although the 
personages involved and certain details 
of the legend vary slightly, the story 
can be summarized as follows. 
During the reign of Emperor Junnin (758-
64), the daughter of a nobleman named 
Yokohagi no Otodo lost interest in the 
mundane world and began to yearn for the
 Western Paradise of Amida. On the 
fifteenth day of the sixth month of 763,
 she cut off her hair to become a nun 
<pb n="559"/>
and for seven days prayed earnestly that
 she might see a living vision of Amida 
while in this life. On the twentieth of 
the same month a nun appeared and 
ordered the former princess to gather a 
hundred horseloads of lotus stems. 
Thanks to an imperial edict, the lotus 
stems were gathered and sent from Omi 
Province, and the nun who had appeared 
spun them into thread. She then 
miraculously dug a well in which she 
dyed the thread into five different hues
. On the evening of the twenty-third 
another nun appeared; by the early hours
 of the following morning, she had 
finished weaving a beautiful mandala 
about 4.5 meters square that depicted 
aspects of the Meditation Sutra. 
The weaver then disappeared. When asked 
who the second nun was, the first nun 
revealed that the weaver was none other 
than the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara in 
human form and that she herself was a 
human incarnation of Amida. After 
explaining the significance of the newly
 woven mandala, the nun departed to the 
West in the midst of clouds. The former 
princess spent the next few years as a 
nun, ceaselessly yearning for the 
Western Paradise, and at the time of her
<pb n="560"/>
 death on the fourth day of the fourth 
month, 775, so tradition holds, Amida 
and his heavenly attendants descended to
 escort her to the Pure Land..."

Sutra. The vertical outer court on the

Ajatasatru as it is related in the

"T'an-luan was not only a believer of 
the Pure Land path but also the first 
major Pure Land writer with several 
works to his credit. His major work, the
 T'an-luan Commentary, is a commentary 
on the Rebirth Treatise. His search for 
immortality with a Taoist master, his 
subsequent conversion to Pure Land, and 
his successes as a healer greatly

the Indian Buddhist teacher Bodhiruci: T
'an Lun opened the conversation by 
saying 'Is there anything in the 
Teaching of the Buddha which is superior
 to the methods for obtaining 
immortality found in this country's 
scriptures on the immortals?' 
Bodhiruci spat on the ground and said, '
What are you saying? There is no 
comparison! Where on this earth can you 
find a method for immortality? Suppose 
that you can obtain youth in your old 
age, and never die: Even having done 
that, you would still be rolling around 
in the Triple World!' So he gave him the
 Meditation Sutra and said, 'these are 
the recipes of Amitabha Buddha: if you 
rely on his practices, you will be 
liberated from Samsara.'" (Raoul

The opposite of Patriarchal Zen. 
Tathagata Zen follows the meditation 
methods and the six Paramitas taught in 
Mahayana sutras, whereas Patriarchal Zen
 emphasizes the direct teaching of the 
patriarchs. 

The two schools of Zen, the Gradual and 
the Sudden, represent different facets 
of the same teaching adapted to 
different types of people in different 
locations. To praise one school while 
disparaging the other is therefore a 
form of attachment, a dualistic view of 
Buddhism not consonant with the Truth. 
NOTE:

Patriarchal Zen or Pure Land or Tantrism

NOTE: 
Apparently, the synthesis of various

The expression "Ten Directions" and "Six

<_-xa>Samantabhadra</_-xa>; <_-xa>Vows/ 
Rebirth In Pure Land</_-xa>; <_-xa>Four 
Great Vows</_-xa>

The famous vows of the Bodhisattva 
Samantabhadra in the Avatamsaka Sutra. 
These vows represent the quintessence of
 this sutra and are the basis of all 
Mahayana practice. Studying the vows and
 putting them into practice is 
tantamount to practicing the teachings 
of the Avatamsaka Sutra. 
In the Avatamsaka Sutra, the Bodhisattva
 Samantabhadra urges the youth Sudhana (
"Good Wealth") and the Ocean-Wide Great 
Assembly to seek rebirth through the Ten
 Great Vows.
These Ten Great Vows are:
"First, worship and respect all Buddhas.
/ Second, praise the Thus Come Ones./ 
Third, make abundant offerings./ Fourth,
 repent misdeeds and hindrances./ Fifth,
 rejoice at others' merits and virtues./
 Sixth, request the Buddha to turn the 
Dharma wheel./ Seventh, request the 
Buddha to remain in the world./ Eighth, 
follow the teachings of the Buddha at 
all times./ Ninth, accommodate and 
benefit all sentient beings./ Tenth, 
<pb n="575"/>
transfer merits and virtues universally.
" Each Vow contains the clause: 
"When the realm of empty space is 
exhausted, my (Vows) will be exhausted. 
But because the realm of empty space is 
inexhaustible, my (Vows) will never end.
 In the same way, when the realms of 
living beings, the karma of living 
beings, and the afflictions of living 
beings are exhausted, my (Vows) will be 
exhausted. But the realms of living 
beings, the karma of living beings, and 
the afflictions of living beings are 
inexhaustible. Therefore, my (Vows) are 
inexhaustible. They continue in thought 
after thought without cease. My body, 
mouth and mind never tire of doing these
 deeds." (Master Hsuan Hua, tr., Flower 
Adornment Sutra, Ch. 40, p. 48. )

The practitioner should cultivate these 
Ten Great Vows with body, mouth and Mind
, and without interruption or lethargy. 
At the time of death, when all family 
and possessions are left behind and all 
faculties disintegrate, only these Great
 Vows will follow close behind, and in 
an instant, the practitioner will be 
reborn in the Pure Land.

<pb n="576"/>
Each of the ten Vows of the Bodhisattva 
Samantabhadra should be put into 
practice without interruption, in 
thought after thought, with body, speech
 and mind. Thus, the three karmas of 
body, speech and mind of the 
practitioner are pure, empty and still. 
In his lifetime, he has sown the seeds 
of rebirth in a pure realm. At the time 
of death, he will naturally be reborn in
 such a realm, of which the most 
representative is the Pure Land of 
Amitabha Buddha. This is a good 
illustration of the Pure Land/Zen 
teaching, "if the mind is pure, the land
 is pure". To have faith in the Vows of 
Samantabhadra is to sow the seeds of 
Enlightenment. These unconditioned (
transcendental) merits and virtues lead 
to Buddhahood. They are therefore 
superior to mundane offerings (even gold
 and jewels), as such offerings can 
bring only conditioned (temporal) merits
 and virtues, leading to a favorable 
rebirth in the human or celestial realms
 -- not Buddhahood. Anyone who reads, 
recites, accepts and explains 
Samantabhadra's vows sows the seeds of 
Buddhahood and ultimately becomes a 
Buddha. His rewards are therefore of an 
<pb n="577"/>
unconditioned nature (without outflows) 
and beyond the Triple Realm -- beyond 
the knowledge and vision of all, except 
for the Buddhas.

represent the 4 compass points and the 4
 intermediate directions. Then, in the 
midst of the mirrors, he placed a Buddha
 image with a lamp before it. At once, 
the spectators saw the Buddha multiplied
 to infinity in every direction."

"Ten aspects of the interrelationship of
 all phenomena, as seen from the 
enlightened point of view. To explain 
such relationship and harmony, the (
Avatamsaka) school advances the Ten 
Profound Propositions (Ten Mysterious 
Gates): 1) All things are co-existent, 
corresponding to one another. 2) The 
intension and extension of one thing 
involve those of others without any 
obstacle. 3) The One and the Many are 
mutually inclusive. 4) All things are 
identical with one another. 5) The 
hidden and the manifested mutually 
perfect each other. 6) All minute and 
abstruse things mutually penetrate one 
another. 7) All things reflect one 
another. 8) Truth is manifested in facts
<pb n="579"/>
 and facts are the source of 
Enlightenment. 9) The past, present and

things are manifestations and

<xa>TEN</xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Non-Seeking Practices</_-xa>
<_-xa>Obstacles to Cultivation</_-xa>

How to Ensure Non-Retrogression of the 
Mind:
"A Pure Land treatise on the Buddha 
Recitation Samadhi has explained the '
ten practices of non-seeking' to 
eliminate the ten major obstacles 
encountered by practitioners on the path
 to Enlightenment. These ten major 
obstacles encompass all obstructions and
 impediments. Therefore if we follow the
 ten non-seeking practices, all 
obstacles will disappear. These ten 
practices are:
1. We should not wish that our bodies be
 always free of diseases and ailments, 
because a disease-free body is prone to 
desire and lust. This leads to precept-
<pb n="580"/>
breaking and retrogression.
2. We should not wish that our lives be 
free of all misfortune and adversity, 
lest we be prone to pride and arrogance.
 This leads us to be disdainful and 
overbearing towards everyone else.
3. We should not wish that our mind 
cultivation be free of all obstacles 
because, in such a case, our knowledge 
would be exceptional. This leads to the 
transgression of thinking that we have 
awakened, when in fact we have not.
4. We should not wish that our 
cultivation be free of demonic obstacles
, because our vows would not then be 
firm and enduring. This leads to the 
transgression of thinking that we have 
attained Enlightenment, when in fact we 
have not.
5. We should not wish that our plans and
 activities meet with easy success, for 
we will then be inclined to thoughts of 
contempt and disrespect. This leads to 
the transgression of pride and conceit, 
thinking ourselves to be filled with 
virtues and talent. 
6. We should not wish for gain in our 
social relations. This leads us to 
violate moral principles and see only 
the mistakes of others. 
<pb n="581"/>
7. We should not wish that everyone, at 
all times, be on good terms and in 
harmony with us. This leads to pride and
 conceit and seeing only our own side of
 every issue. 
8. We should not wish to be repaid for 
our good deeds, lest we develop a 
calculating mind. This leads to greed 
for fame and fortune. 
9. We should not wish to share in 
opportunities for profit, lest the mind 
of delusion arise. This leads us to lose
 our good name and reputation for the 
sake of unwholesome gain. 
10. When subject to injustice and wrong,
 we should not necessarily seek the 
ability to refute and rebut, as doing so
 indicates that the mind of self-and-
others has not been severed. This will 
certainly lead to more resentment and 
hatred ... 
Thus, in merit there is misfortune, in 
misfortune there is merit, in freedom 
there are obstructions, in obstructions 
there is freedom. Realizing this, 
cultivators in the past have used '
obstacles as conditions for progress.' 
They have said, 'If others do not bother
 and disturb us, success in the Way is 
difficult to achieve.' This is because 
<pb n="582"/>
contempt, slander, calamity, injustice 
and all other obstacles are the '
yardsticks to measure the practitioner's
 level of attainment.' Remaining patient
 and calm in the face of such 
impediments, the cultivator demonstrates
 that he has reached a high level of 
practice. If it were not for these 
obstacles, how could his level of 
attainment be measured? In truth, it is 
not that the practitioner seeks 
obstacles and impediments, but that he 
must be ever-vigilant, for the Way is 
full of dangerous and unforeseen events.
 He should prepare himself for all 
eventualities so that when faced with 
actual obstacles, he can remain calm and
 unruffled. An Elder Master once said: '
Only those with wisdom and strong 
determination can apply these ten 
practices. As long as they meditate, are
 enlightened and hold steadfastly to 
these ten practices, even if they enter 
the realms of the demons, the demons 
cannot make them retrogress. Even though
 they may be in the realms of form, 
sound, fame, fortune, love, hate, right,
 wrong, prosperity, decline, success, 
failure ... they will still be calm and 
at peace.' Thus, if we are deluded, all 
<pb n="583"/>
good and favorable circumstances can 
become conditions obstructing the Way. 
If we truly understand that all diseases
, suffering and demonic obstacles are 
inherently empty and false, lacking true
 substance, they cannot harm us in any 
way."

Universal Method</_-xa>; <_-xa>Pure Land

Meditation Sutra</_-xa>

"According to the Meditation Sutra, even
 the most evil person may be reborn in 
the Pure Land, if at the time of death 
he or she is able to embrace the Pure 
Land faith and maintain single-minded 
and undisturbed recollection of the 
<pb n="588"/>
Buddha Amitabha for 'ten successive 
moments.' Hence although Pure Land 
Buddhism ordinarily encourages that one 
turn to Amitabha sooner rather than 
later in life, the ten moments of 
mindfulness nonetheless provide a last-
minute means of assuring one's salvation
. The Ten Recitation practice is offered
 as both a daily meditation and a 
rehearsal for that fateful moment to 
come." 

"'Ten recitations' refers to the T en 
Recitations method taught by a well-
known Master, which is based on the 
lowest grade of rebirth described in the
 Meditation Sutra. It is reserved 
specifically for those who are busy with
 mundane activities, so that they, too, 
can practice Buddha Recitation and 
achieve rebirth in the Pure Land. The 
method consists of uttering Amitabha 
Buddha's name approximately ten times 
each time one inhales and exhales. The 
real intent behind this practice is to 
use the breath to concentrate the mind. 
Depending on the cultivator's breath 
span, he may recite more than ten 
utterances or fewer. After ten 
inhalations/exhalations (or some fifty 
<pb n="589"/>
to one hundred utterances in total) the 
cultivator may proceed to recite the 
Transference of Merit stanza: 'I vow to 
be reborn in the Western Pure Land,/ The
 nine lotus grades are my parents./ As 
the lotus flowers bloom, I will see 
Buddha Amitabha and reach No-Birth,/ 
Liberating all sentient beings'... After
 reciting the stanza, the practitioner 
bows to the Buddhas three times before 
retiring. This practice has its roots in
 the boundless compassion of Buddha 
Sakyamuni and the Patriarchs. However 
busy a practitioner is, he can engage in
 this method and step into the path of 
liberation. There is one caveat about 
the Ten Recitations method. While 
inhaling and exhaling, the practitioner 
should recite the number of utterances 
with which he feels most comfortable, 
without trying to lengthen or shorten 
his normal breath span. Otherwise he 
might develop a respiratory ailment." 

NOTE: 
The Ten Recitations method is a 
universal method (q.v.), truly in the 
spirit of Mahayana Buddhism because it 
can be of benefit to persons of the 
lowest spirituality as well as to those 
<pb n="590"/>
of the highest. To those at a low level,
 it brings moral comfort, rebirth in the
 Pure Land while to the highly 
metaphysically inclined, it is a means 
to concentrate the Mind, achieve samadhi
 and ultimately Buddhahood.

<_-xa>Fifty-two Levels of Bodhisattva 
Practice</_-xa>; <_-xa>Dasabumika Sutra</_-xa>

"Ten Stages (or Ten Bhumi) through which
 the practitioner advances in Buddhist 
practice. In the system of the fifty-two
 (or
fifty-three) levels of Bodhisattva 
practice, they are viewed as the forty-
<pb n="591"/>
first through fiftieth levels. There are
 several 'ten stages' of varying content
 listed in different scriptures. The 
Avatamsaka Sutra divides Buddhist 
practice into ten Stages, as follows: (1
) the stage of joy (Skt./ Paramudita), 
in which one rejoices at realizing a 
partial aspect of the truth; (2) the 
stage of purity (vimala), in which one 
is free from all defilement; (3) the 
stage of the emission of light (
prabhakari), in which one radiates the 
light of wisdom; (4) the stage of 
glowing (archishmati), in which the 
flame of wisdom burns away earthly 
desires; (5) the stage of overcoming 
final illusions (sudurjaya), in which 
one surmounts the illusions of darkness,
 or ignorance as the Middle Way; (6) the
 stage of the sign of supreme wisdom (
abhimukhi), in which supreme wisdom 
begins to appear; (7) the stage of 
progression (duramgama), in which one 
rises above the states of the Two 
Vehicles; (8) the stage of immobility (
achala), in which one dwells firmly in 
the truth of the Middle Way and cannot 
be perturbed by anything; (9) the stage 
of the all-penetrating wisdom (sadhumati
), in which one preaches the Law freely 
<pb n="592"/>
and without restriction; and (10) the 
stage of the (Cloud of Teaching) (
dharmamegha), in which one benefits all 
sentient beings with the Law (Dharma), 
just as a cloud sends down rain 
impartially on all things."

In other words, "the ten Stages of 
developing Bodhi-wisdom are (1) joy at 
benefiting oneself and others, (2) 
freedom from all possible defilement, (3
) the emission of the light of Wisdom, (
4) glowing Wisdom, (5) overcoming the 
utmost difficulties, (6) the realization
 of Wisdom, (7) proceeding far, (8) the 
attainment of immobility, (9) the 
attainment of expedient Wisdom, and (10)
 the ability to spread the teachings 
over the Dharmadhatu (the whole universe
) as clouds overspread the sky." 

Avatamsaka Sutra
Of the Ten Stages of Bodhisattvahood the
 first stage is the Stage of Extreme Joy
, which is described as follows in the 
Avatamsaka Sutra:
"Here, standing on the stage of extreme 
joy of Bodhisattvas, one is filled with 
extreme joy, filled with calm, filled 
with happiness, filled with ebullience .
<pb n="593"/>
.. One becomes extremely joyful, 
thinking of the Buddha (Buddha-
recitation), of the Buddha's teaching ..
. Thus thinking, the Bodhisattva gives 
rise to extreme joy. Why? Because that 
is what happens to all fears with the 
Bodhisattva's attainment of the stage of
 joy -fears such as fear of not 
surviving, fear of ill-repute, fear of 
death, fear of falling into the Evil 
Realms, fear of intimidation by groups .
.. thus all fears and terrors are 
removed." (T. Cleary, tr., The Flower 
Ornament Sutra.) Clear: II/15 NOTE: In 
current Buddhist usage, the word "stage"
 is sometimes used for any of the fifty-
two levels of Bodhisattva practice and 
not necessarily for one of the ten 
Bhumis (the 4lst through the 50th levels
). The reader should therefore keep the 
distinction in mind when studying 
Mahayana texts.

"Very few treatises on Pure Land have 
been found in India. In fact the only 
extant work devoted exclusively to 
Amitabha Pure Land Buddhism is the fifth
 century work attributed to Vasubandhu (
Vn/ The-Than) that survives only in its 
Chinese translation, the Rebirth 
Treatise. There are, however, a few 
older writings that comment on aspects 
of Pure Land doctrine. Among these, the 
earliest documents are attributed to 
Nagarjuna (hence, dated around 200), the
 Ta Chih Tu Lui (Great Perfection of 
Wisdom Treatise) and the Commentary on 
the Ten Stages Sutra. In the latter text
's chapter on 'Easy Practice,' the 
author discusses the attainment of the 
non-retrogressive state and then 
distinguishes two paths. The first 
follows the 'easy practice' (i-hsing) of
 devotion, which is likened to riding on
 a vessel over water. The 'difficult' (
nan) path resembles a person walking on 
land to his destination. Amitabha is one
<pb n="595"/>
 among numerous transcendent Buddhas to 
whom devotion of easy practice may be 
directed. In East Asia, the distinction 
between the difficult and the easy path 
served as one of the primary doctrinal 
bases for the establishment of Pure Land
 as an independent school."

"Sri Lankan Theravada was established as
 the predominant tradition in Thailand 
in the fourteenth century. Today Thai 
Buddhism is highly hierarchic and 
organized. It also comes under a degree 
of state supervision and the king is the
 Supreme Patriarch. Not surprisingly, 
therefore, the local 'church' has its 
radicals and reformers as well as its 
unbending conservatives. Much of its 
vitality, however, lies away from the 
towns and cities in rural forest areas 
where serious practitioners are ordained
<pb n="597"/>
 and get down to the real business of 
doing Buddhism. One well-known modern 
master of the forest tradition is Ajahn 
Chah, who has trained many Western monks
, notably Ajahn Sumedho, the American 
founder of four new Theravada 
monasteries in Britain and others 
elsewhere."

The themes of iconography are fixed by 
tradition and are based on three 
principles: expression, proportion, 
detail. Commissioning the painting of 
thangka and the painting itself are 
considered highly meritorious actions. 
The images are painted on linen with 
vegetable- and mineral-based pigments. 
In some cases they serve as visual 
reminders of general Buddhist teachings 
<pb n="598"/>
-- examples are the wheel of life and 
depictions of the previous existences of
 the Buddha. In other cases thangkas 
play an important ritual role -as, for 
example, detailed paintings of central 
personalities of a particular school 
being used in the Three Refuges Ceremony
. However, the most important role of 
the thangka is connected with the 
performance of sadhanas (meditations), 
where the picture functions as a support
 for memory in the process of 
visualization. Painted mandalas fulfill 
the same purpose."

<xa>THERAGATHA/</xa>

'The Theragatha consists of a collection
 of verses (gatha) attributed to some 
<pb n="599"/>
250 senior (thera) monks, of early 
Buddhism, renowned for their spiritual 
attainments and virtue. Similarly the 
Therigatha is a collection of verses 
attributed to 'senior' (thera) nuns of 
the same period. The two collections 
form part of the Khuddaka Nikaya, which 
is part of the Sutta-Pitaka of the 
Buddhist Pali canon." 

I. Theragatha:
"The eighth of fifteen collections of 
texts included in the Khuddaka Nikaya of
 the Pali Canon. The Theragatha or '
Verses of the Elder Monks,' contains a 
series of 264 poems attributed to 259 
male disciples of the Buddha. They are 
arranged in twenty-one fascicles, 
ranging from poems of one verse only up 
to a final poem of seventy-one verses. 
The text celebrates the fruits of 
attainment, including such benefits as 
freedom from mundane woes and the 
benefits of the meditative life." 

II.Therigatha: 
Collection of 73 gathas (verses) of 
elder nuns who became famous through 
their virtue during the time of 
Sakyamuni Buddha. 
<pb n="600"/>
The verses are held by modern scholars 
to contain authentic compositions of the
 earliest Buddhist period, although some
 parts appear to be the work of later 
redactors on the basis of fragments of 
reminiscence. The verses are attributed 
to particular monks or nuns by name. 
Although such ascriptions may not in 
every case be entirely correct, in many 
instances there is sound tradition 
behind the ascription. Like other early 
Buddhist literature, they are of value 
for reconstructing ancient Indian social
 history. The Theragatha has a total of 
1,279 verses; the Therigatha 522. These 
have been translated into English by C.A
.F. Rhys-Davids, the former as Psalms of
 the Bretlven (2nd edn. 1937, repr. 1964
); the latter as Psalms of the Sisters (
1909, repr. 1964). (A new translation of
 part of the Therigatha by Susan Murdock
 appeared recently as The First Buddhist
 Women)." 

A Therigatha story
"Kisagotami was married to a banker's 
son of considerable wealth. As a young 
wife, Kisagotami was mistreated by her 
in-laws ... When she gave birth to a son
, she finally received an honorable 
<pb n="601"/>
place among her husband's relatives. But
 her child died while still a toddler 
and Kisagotami, who had never seen death
 before, went mad. In her state of 
insanity, Kisagotami took up the dead 
child and carried him on her hip from 
house to house, begging for medicine. 
One kind old man directed her to Buddha 
Sakyamuni. The Buddha said, 'Go and 
bring a white mustard seed from a house 
where no one has died.' Hearing his 
words, she immediately rushed off in the
 innocent faith that if she brought a 
white mustard seed to this enlightened 
sage, it would be the medicine that 
could miraculously bring her child back 
to life. Kisagotami went from house to 
house, at each house asking, and at each
 house learning that there too, someone 
had died. The truth struck home. Her 
sanity returned. 'Little son,' she said.
 'I thought that death had happened to 
you alone; but it is not to you alone. 
It is common to all people.' ... She 
carried him gently to the forest and 
left him there. (Susan Murdock, The 
First Buddhist Women, p. 85.)

Buddhism</_-xa>; <_-xa>Doctrine of the 
Elders</_-xa>
<_-xa>Mahayana Buddhism</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Mahayana / Theravada</_-xa>

"One of the two major streams of 
Buddhism, the other being Mahayana." 

"Southern Buddhism. The general name for
 the early Buddhism propagated after 
Asoka in the south of India, Sri Lanka, 
Thailand, Burma, etc. The scriptures 
preserved in these countries are written
 in the Pali language and belong to 
Theravada teachings. Practitioners aim 
at attaining the state of Arhat." 

"Theravada teaching corresponds to the 
Agama sutras. These teachings generally 
hold that the self is without substance,
 the separate elements (dharmas) are 
real, and Nirvana is their total 
annihilation." 

"Southern Buddhism (The early Buddhism).
 A term coined by Mahayanists to 
distinguish this school of Buddhism (
<pb n="603"/>
whose modern descendent is Theravada), 
from Mahayana. It is distinguished from 
Mahayana in putting emphasis on one's 
own liberation, whereas the teaching of 
Mahayana stresses the attainment of 
Buddhahood for all sentient beings. 
Theravada is now prevalent in Southeast 
Asia, while Mahayana has spread over the
 northeast area (China, Vietnam, Korea, 
Japan ...) (G.C.C. Chang)." 

Background
"(Theravada means) the 'Doctrine of the 
Elders' who formed the lst Buddhist 
Council. The sole survivor of the 18 
sects into which by the third century B.
C. the original primitive School of 
Buddhism was divided. Until recently 
this school was known in the West by its
 generic name of Hinayana, which means 
smaller or lesser vehicle (of salvation)
, but this term of reproach, coined by 
the Mahayanists, has now been dropped in
 favour of the more accurate and less 
discourteous name of Theravada, the way 
of the Elders. As the Theravada school 
covers SriLanka, Burma, Thailand and 
Cambodia, it is sometimes called the 
Southern School, to distinguish it from 
the Northern or Mahayana School which 
<pb n="604"/>
covers Tibet, Mongolia, China, Korea, 
Japan and Vietnam, among other countries
."

"After Shakyamuni's death, the Buddhist 
Order experienced several schisms and 
eventually split into eighteen or twenty
 schools. The monks of these schools, in
 their concern to preserve the Buddha's 
teachings, tended more and more to 
seclude themselves in their monasteries,
 where they devoted themselves to 
upholding the monastic precepts and 
writing doctrinal exegeses. Around the 
end of the first century B.C. or the 
beginning of the first century A.D., a 
new group of Buddhists emerged who were 
dissatisfied with what they perceived as
 the sterile academicism of the earlier 
schools. They practiced among the lay 
people, calling themselves Bodhisattvas,
 and aimed at the salvation of all 
people. They called their teachings 
Mahayana (Great Vehicle), meaning the 
teaching which can carry many people to 
enlightenment, and referred to the 
traditional schools as the Lesser 
Vehicle."

The dilemma of "Ven. Ajahn Chah (a well 
<pb n="605"/>
know Thai master) reflected a conflict 
that had beset the Theravada tradition 
throughout its history in Sri Lanka and 
Thailand. State support meant that the 
Buddhist order was guaranteed the 
material and social security needed to 
ensure the preservation of the Dharma. 
But in return the monks were to serve 
the interests of the State by 
establishing a moral and spiritual 
framework whereby the people would live 
in harmony... This caused the order to 
fracture into two parts: 'forest monks,'
 who placed a premium on realizing 
Nirvana, and 'town monks,' who chose to 
serve as village priests, administrators
 in city temples, or scholars and 
teachers. Once a Shikoku's role as a 
cleric superseded his religious 
aspirations...the practice of meditation
 became a luxury for which there was (
often) little time and interest." 
NOTES:
Unlike Mahayana schools, the Theravada 
tradition makes no mention of Amitabha 
Buddha, the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, 
etc. or the Pure Land. Theravadins 
believe mainly in Sakyamuni Buddha and 
the Bodhisattva Maitreya, but not in the
 numerous transhistorical Buddhas and 
<pb n="606"/>
Bodhisattvas of the Mahayana tradition. 
This is because Theravada stresses the 
historical Buddha and His early 
teachings, applying the term Bodhisattva
 mainly to the previous incarnations of 
Buddha Sakyamuni. 

Please note that the difference between 
"meditative forest monks" and "town 
monks" has been deliberately emphasized 
to draw home a point. In practice they 
can be viewed as monks of different 
specialisation's, the first group 
stressing wisdom (the result of 
meditation) and the second compassion (
serving one's community). As such they 
are the two indispensable wings of the 
bird of enlightenment -- of Buddhahood.

<xa>THIRD</xa>
<_-xa>Karma</_-xa>; <_-xa>No Good Deed Goes
 Unpunished</_-xa>

A general Buddhist Teaching which can be
 summarized as follows: In the first 
lifetime, the practitioner engages in 
mundane good deeds which bring ephemeral
 worldly blessings (wealth, power, 
authority, etc.) in the second lifetime.
 Since power tends to corrupt, he is 
likely to create evil karma, resulting 
in retribution in the third lifetime. 
Thus good deeds in the first lifetime 
are potential 'enemies' of the third 
lifetime.

To ensure that mundane good deeds do not
 become 'enemies', the practitioner 
should dedicate all merits to a 
transcendental goal, i.e., to become 
Bodhisattvas or Buddhas or, in Pure Land
 teaching to achieve rebirth in the Pure
 Land -- a Buddha-land beyond Birth and 
<pb n="609"/>
Death. In the mundane context, these 
three lifetimes can be conceived of as 
three generations. Thus, the patriarch 
of a prominent family, through work and 
luck, amasses great power, fortune and 
influence (first lifetime). His children
 are then able to enjoy a leisurely, and
, too often, dissipated life (second 
lifetime). By the generation of the 
grandchildren, the family's fortune and 
good reputation have all but disappeared
 (third lifetime). 

A Case history
"When you look at the third generation 
of Kennedy men, much of what remains of 
a once powerful dynasty is good teeth, 
good hair and the best public relations 
a trust fund can buy. Some of the boys 
grew up being spoiled and bratty--
belittling the help, once chasing the 
cook up a tree at Hickory Hill--into 
full-blown debauchery, driving fast, 
drinking hard, club hopping like wild 
men. Most of this got spun up by family 
retainers into the playful high jinks of
 a raucous clan. But the escapades got 
seamier over time when Joe Kennedy II 
left a young woman paralyzed after an 
accident on Nantucket. Bobby Jr. was 
<pb n="610"/>
arrested for possession of heroin. David
 died in a Florida hotel of a cocaine, 
Demerol and Mellaril overdose..." Time: 
May 12 '97 
NOTE: 
The concept of the Third Lifetime is the
 basis of the Pure Land School emphasis 
on seeking rebirth in the Pure Land in 
this lifetime, rather than relying on 
gradual cultivation, lifetime after 
lifetime, as in Zen and other schools.

<pb n="612"/>

"These auspicious marks of great persons
 originated outside Buddhism and were

 use of Buddha images with these 
auspicious marks. These marks include a 
white hair between the eyebrows, light 
from between the eyebrows, Buddha's 
circle of light, a mound of flesh on the

Three groups of precepts which form the 
basis of all Bodhisattva practice: (1) 
Do not what is evil, (2) Do what is good
 and (3) Be of benefit to all sentient 
<pb n="613"/>
beings. All Bodhisattva precepts and 
vows, or for that matter, all precepts 
derive ultimately from the Three Bodies 
of Pure Precepts. These precepts may in 
principle be administered to Buddhists 
in lieu of the full set of Bodhisattva 
precepts described in the Brahma Net 
Sutra. 
Illustrative Story:
"The Maha-Maya Sutra (T l7.555b-586a) 
recounts the tale of Malika, the wife of
 King Prasenajit, who lies, seductively 
adorns her body, entertains, and serves 
wine to the king. These unlawful things 
she does in order to mollify the king's 
anger and keep him from taking the life 
of a cook who has angered him. Because 
her motives were wholesome and pure, the
 Buddha praises her actions. Chan-jan (T
 46.205a4-7) notes: 'This (story) tells 
of breaking the precepts to save beings 
because of the Bodhisattva's basic 
desire to benefit others. As such, it is
 known as 'good in the midst of evil.'. 
. . Anyone wishing to follow this 
example must assess his or her motives 
judiciously. If one is just indulging 
desire, it is not on the order of 
observance of the precepts.'" 

<pb n="614"/>


<xa>THREE</xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Trikaya</_-xa>
<_-xa>Dharma body</_-xa>; <_-xa>Nirmanakaya
</_-xa>

"Three kinds of body which a Buddha may 
possess. A concept adopted in Mahayana 
to organize different concepts of the 
Buddha appearing in the sutras." 
The three bodies are: 
l. Dharmakaya: the Dharma-body, or the "
body of reality", which is formless, 
unchanging, transcendental, and 
inconceivable. Synonymous with suchness,
 or emptiness. 
2. Sambhogakaya the "body of enjoyment,"
 the celestial body of the Buddha. 
Personification of eternal perfection in
 its ultimate sense. It "resides in the 
Pure Land and never manifests itself in 
the mundane world, but only in the 
celestial spheres, accompanied by 
enlightened Bodhisattvas." 
3. Nirmanakaya: the "incarnated body" of
 the Buddha. In order to benefit certain
 sentient beings, a Buddha incarnates 
himself into an appropriate visible body
, such as that of Sakyamuni Buddha. The 
<pb n="615"/>
incarnated body of the Buddha should not
 be confused with a magically produced 
Buddha. The former is a real, tangible 
human body which has a definite life 
span. The latter is an illusory Buddha-
form which is produced by miraculous 
powers and can be withdrawn by 
miraculous powers (G.C.C. Chang).

<xa>THREE</xa>
<_-xa>Rebirth in the Pure Land</_-xa>; <_-xa>Death</_-xa>; <_-xa>Love / Sex</_-xa>

"Elder Master Tzu Chao once said: The 
Pure Land practitioner on the verge of 
death usually faces Three Points of 
Doubt and Four Narrow Passes which 
obstruct his rebirth in the Pure Land. 
He should be prepared, reflecting on 
them in advance to eliminate them. 
'The Three Points of Doubt are: 1) 
Fearing that his past karma is heavy and
<pb n="617"/>
 his period of cultivation short, and 
that therefore, he may not achieve 
rebirth in the Pure Land; 2) Fearing 
that he has not yet fulfilled his vows 
and obligations or severed greed, anger 
and delusion, and that therefore, he may
 not achieve rebirth in the Pure Land. 3
) Fearing that even though he has 
recited the Buddha's name, Buddha 
Amitabha may not come, and that 
therefore, he may not achieve rebirth in
 the Pure Land. 
The main Narrow Passes are: 1 ) Because 
of suffering due to illness, he may come
 to malign the Buddhas as ineffective 
and unresponsive; 2) Because of love-
attachment, he may chain himself to his 
family, unable to let go. 
Once aware of the doctrine of the Three 
Doubts and the Four Narrow Paths, the 
wise can ponder and find a solution. The
 author shall merely summarize a few 
points below. Fellow cultivators can

backgrounds and understanding.

1. Previous heavy karma, present 
perfunctory practice. Amitabha Buddha is
 renowned for his Eighteenth Vow: not to
 attain Buddhahood unless sentient 
<pb n="618"/>
beings who sincerely desire to be reborn
 in the Pure Land, and who 
singlemindedly recite His name, are 
reborn there. The Buddhas do not engage 
in false speech, and therefore the 
practitioner should believe in them. Ten
 utterances or thoughts represent a very
 short cultivation period, yet the 
practitioner can still achieve rebirth 
in the Pure Land. We who have recited 
the Buddha's name many times over should
, therefore, eliminate all doubts. 
Moreover, no matter how heavy the karma 
of sentient beings is, if they sincerely
 repent and rely upon Amitabha Buddha, 
they will all be welcomed and guided 
back to the Pure Land. Do we not recall 
that the Meditation Sutra teaches: If 
anyone who has commited the Five Grave 
Offenses or Ten Evil Deeds sees an evil 
omen appear as he is on the verge of 
death, he need only recite the Buddha's 
name one to ten times, singlemindedly, 
and Buddha Amitabha will descend to 
welcome and escort him back to the Pure 
Land. In the commentary Accounts of 
Rebirth, there are cases of individuals 
who throughout their lives were breaking
 the precepts (particularly the precept 
against killing) and on their deathbeds,
<pb n="619"/>
 when the 'marks of hell' appeared and, 
desperate, they singlemindedly recited 
the Buddha's name, they immediately saw 
Amitabha Buddha arriving to welcome them
. Why should we, who are not that sinful
 or deluded, worry about not achieving 
rebirth in the Pure Land?
2. Unfulfilled vows; non-severance of 
greed, anger and delusion. Cultivators' 
vows can be divided into two categories:
 religious and mundane. Religious vows: 
Some practitioners have vowed to build a
 temple, practice charity or recite 
various sutras or mantras a certain 
number of times, etc. However, they have
 not completely fulfilled their vows 
when it is time for them to die. These 
cultivators should think: reciting the 
Buddha's name in all earnestness will 
earn them rebirth in the Pure Land, 
where they will have ample opportunity 
to achieve immeasurable merits and 
virtues. Their present vows to build 
temples and recite sutras are merely 
secondary matters. The fact that they 
may not have fulfilled them should be of
 no great concern. 
Mundane vows: These include family 
obligations such as caring for sick, 
aging parents or helpless wives and 
<pb n="620"/>
young children, as well as business 
debts to be paid or certain other 
commitments to be fulfilled. Faced with 
these worries, the practitioner should 
think: on our deathbed, there is nothing
 that can be done, whether we worry or 
not. It is better to concentrate on 
Buddha Recitation. Once we are reborn in
 the Pure Land and Buddhahood is 
achieved, all vows, wishes and debts can
 be taken care of, as we will be in a 
position to rescue everyone, family and 
foes alike. The Questions of King 
Milinda Sutra contains the following 
parable: A minute grain of sand, dropped
 on the surface of the water, will sink 
immediately. On the other hand, a block 
of stone, however large and heavy, can 
easily be moved from place to place by 
boat. The same is true of the Pure Land 
practitioner. However light his karma 
may be, if he is not rescued by Amitabha
 Buddha, he must revolve in the cycle of
 Birth and Death. With the help of 
Amitabha Buddha, his karma, however 
heavy, will not prevent his rebirth in 
the Pure Land. We can see from this 
passage that thanks to 'other-power,' 
the Pure Land method can benefit the 
practitioner, however heavy his karma 
<pb n="621"/>
may be. The huge block of stone 
represents the weight of heavy karma, 
the boat symbolizes the power of 
Amitabha Buddha's Vows. Therefore, the 
cultivator should not think that 
residual greed, anger and delusion will 
prevent him from achieving rebirth in 
the Pure Land. This example should also 
resolve doubts concerning past heavy 
karma, as in doubts number one above. 3.
 Despite recitation, Amitabha Buddha may
 not come, after all. At the time of 
death, the Pure Land practitioner will 
see, depending on his virtues, Amitabha 
Buddha, the Bodhisattvas or the Ocean-
Wide Assembly come to welcome him. 
Sometimes he may not see anything, but, 
thanks to the power of his vows and the 
'gathering in' power of Amitabha Buddha,
 he will be reborn in the Pure Land all 
the same. The difference lies in his 
level of cultivation, whether subtle or 
gross, transcendental or mundane. What 
is most important at the time of death 
is to recite the Buddha's name 
singlemindedly and in all earnestness 
and not worry about anything else. Any 
doubts at that time will give rise to 
obstructions and impediments. In summary
, at the time of death, the practitioner
<pb n="622"/>
 should not be concerned about whether 
or not he witnesses auspicious signs. He
 should just concentrate on reciting the
 Buddha's name in all earnestness until 
the very end.

(II) Overcoming the Narrow Passes These 
'passes' can be summarized as follows: 
(1) - Slandering the Buddhas because of 
suffering and disease and (2) - Binding 
and chaining oneself to family and 
friends through love-attachment. Sincere
 practitioners who meet accidents, 
disease and disaster should reflect that
 these are sometimes due to virtues 
accrued through cultivation. Either the 
heavy karma (which he should have 
endured) has been commuted to light 
karma (which he is now enduring), or 
else, future karma has been transformed 
into current karma, giving him the 
opportunity to repay karmic debts before
 achieving rebirth in the Pure Land. 
Should he doubt this and speak ill of 
the Dharma, he would lack faith and 
understanding, display ingratitude 
toward the Buddhas, and bring evil karma
 upon himself. Among the rebirth stories
, we find instances where this 'bunching
 and compressing of karma' has allowed 
<pb n="623"/>
cultivators to hasten their rebirth in 
the Pure Land. Therefore, when Pure Land
 cultivators encounter such instances, 
they should be aware and understand them
 thoroughly. Furthermore, this body is 
illusory and provisional. Depending on 
his merit or bad karma, the practitioner
's life will be long or short, happy or 
filled with hardship. He should 
systematically rely on the Buddhas and 
firmly believe in the law of cause and 
effect. When ill or in bad health, the 
practitioner should direct his thoughts 
toward Amitabha Buddha exclusively. He 
should not seek the help of externalist 
gurus, shamans or healers. Nor should he
 listen to those who do not yet 
understand the Dharma and revert to a 
non-vegetarian diet, drink alcoholic 
beverages, etc... His mind will then be 
calm and undisturbed at the time of 
death."

"The three lower states of Samsara: hell
-dweller, hungry ghost, and animal. To 
be born in a miserable state is the 
result of evil karma committed in a past
 life. When the retribution for that 
karma is completed, one will again be 
born in a higher state." 

The paths of hells, hungry ghosts, 
animality. These paths can be taken as 
states of mind; i.e., when someone has a
 vicious thought of maiming or killing 
another, he is effectively reborn, for 
that moment, in the hells.

"According to Buddhist teachings, karmic
 results follow ineluctably upon the 
perpetration of acts, irrespective of 
conscious attitude or moral conscience (
although the quality and force of the 
act may be significantly affected 
thereby). Thus beings in the lower 
states, animals for example, do indeed 
accumulate karma and must sooner or 
later experience the consequences of 
<pb n="625"/>
their actions, even though these may be 
performed under the irresistible 
influence of instinct. And the Karmic 
situation is compounded, rather than 
mitigated, by an unconsciousness of the 
Dharma. The strength of instinctual 
habit and the ignorance of what behavior
 is to be adopted and what behavior is 
to be abandoned constitutes one of the 
principal miseries of existence in 
states other than that of the precious 
human condition."

Syn: <_-xa>Three Secrets</_-xa>
<_-xa>Esoteric school</_-xa>

"In esoteric Buddhism this term refers 
to the body, speech, and mind of the 
Buddha, which are regarded as secret 
because they are not fully known to 
ordinary men. An enlightened man can 
realize the three secrets as a religious
 ritual by making a mudra with his hand,
 uttering a mantra, and contemplating an
 esoteric deity." 

"Also called the Three Secrets. 
According to the Shingon (q.v.) teaching
, since Maha-Vairocana (Dainichi) Buddha
 is held to be omnipresent, all beings 
are the mystic body of the Buddha, all 
<pb n="627"/>
sounds the mystic mouth (i.e., voice) of
 the Buddha, and all thoughts the mystic
 mind of the Buddha. 
However, the Buddha's body, mouth and 
mind are unimaginably profound and 
beyond the common mortal's understanding
. Therefore they are called 'mysteries.'
 Moreover, the body, mouth and mind of 
common mortals are not essentially 
different from those of the Buddha, 
although their Buddha nature is clouded 
by illusion. In this sense, the body, 
mouth and mind of the common mortal in 
their essential aspect are also called 
the three mysteries. In terms of 
practice, esoteric teaching defines the 
mystic body to be the making of mudras 
with the hands, the mystic mouth to be 
the uttering of mantras (mystic words), 
and the mystic mind to be meditation on 
an esoteric mandala or one of the 
figures appearing on it. Through the 
medium of these three practices, the 
body, mouth and mind of the common 
mortal are said to be united with those 
of Vairocana Buddha, enabling the 
sincere practitioner to attain 
Buddhahood in his present form." 

"The secret of body finds expression in 
<pb n="628"/>
various hand gestures (mudra), 
meditation postures, and the use of 
certain ritual implements, such as vajra
 or lotus, that are associated with one 
or another Buddha or Bodhisattva being 
invoked. The
secret of speech is related to the 
recitation of mantras and dharanis; the 
secret of mind, to the 'five wisdoms,' 
which make the comprehension of reality 
possible, and to samadhi. Through 
particular rituals, which are rooted in 
these three secrets, a connection 
between the practitioner and a 
particular Buddha is brought about, 
through which the state of 'Buddha in me
, me in Buddha' can be realized, i.e., 
Buddhahood (in principle) can be 
attained in this lifetime." 

"For Tantric Buddhists, the elimination 
of all duality -- the experience of 
fundamental unity in enlightenment -- is
 symbolized by the vajra."

Samadhi: training the mind, and (3) 
Wisdom: training in wisdom (prajna). 
These three areas of training
cover the entire Buddhist teaching." 

"In Buddhism, there is no cultivation 
without discipline, concentration and 
wisdom, and also there is no Dharma 
without discipline, concentration and 
wisdom." (Hsu Heng Chi, What's Buddhism?
, p.39.)
"If people want to get rid of anger or 
greed, they can't do it without wisdom. 
Greed, anger, and stupidity are called 
the 'Three Poisons' and are also called 
'thieving afflictions.' These thieving 
afflictions can be arrested through 
Precepts, Samadhi, and Wisdom. With 
precepts, you can capture the thief at 
the source. You will be able to 
recognize the source of the affliction. 
With samadhi, you can suppress the 
thieves. You will be able to keep them 
in one place so that they won't go wild.
<pb n="630"/>
 But at this point, although you have 
caught them and bound them, you haven't 
yet extinguished them. You've got to 
destroy these thieves so that they will 
never rise again. Only wisdom can 
terminate affections." Brahma Net/
Commentary:13
"We must also recognize that this 
discipline, concentration, and wisdom 
are equivalent to the Dharma gate of 
Buddha Recitation. How so? Discipline (
precept-keeping) means preventing 
wrongdoing. If you can wholeheartedly 
practice Buddha-remembrance, evil will 
not dare to enter: this is discipline. 
Concentration means eliminating the 
scattering characteristic of ordinary 
mind If you wholeheartedly practice 
Buddha-remembrance, mind does not have 
any other object: this is concentration.
 Wisdom means clear perception. If you 
contemplate the sound of the Buddha's 
name with each syllable distinct, and 
also contemplate that the one who is 
mindful and the object of this 
mindfulness are both unattainable, this 
is wisdom." (Master Zhuhong in Pure Land

Pure Land School</_-xa>

Pure Land Buddhism is based on three 
basic sutras: 
a) Amitabha Sutra (or Shorter Amitabha 
Sutra, or Smaller Sukhavati-Vyuha, or 
the Sutra of Amida); 
b) Longer Amitabha Sutra (or Longer 
Sukhavati-Vyuha, the Sutra of Infinite 
Life, Muryoju-kyo);
c) Meditation Sutra (or the Meditation 
on the Buddha of Infinite Life, the 
Amitayur Dhyana Sutra, Kammuryoju-kyo). 
The last chapter of the Avatamsaka Sutra
 ("The Practices and Vows of the 
Bodhisattva Samantabhadra") is sometimes
<pb n="634"/>
 considered the fourth basic sutra of 
the Pure Land tradition. (Note: Master T
'ai Hsu, the famous Chinese monk who 
organized the revival of Buddhism in 
China between the Wars, taught that the 
Longer Amitabha Sutra is a shorter form 
of the Lotus Sutra.) 

"Of the many Mahayana sutras that have 
at least some mention of the (or a) Pure
 Land, three are given special 
prominence in Pure Land Buddhism, as 
they are wholly concerned with Amitabha'
s Pure Land. Two sutras, which exist in 
Sanskrit and have the same title of 
Sukhavativyuha, are commonly referred to
 as 'larger' and 'smaller' because of 
their great difference in length. The 
third sutra exists only in Chinese, and 
is known by its short title of Kuan 
Ching (Meditation Sutra). It is also 
referred to by the reconstructed 
Sanskrit title Amitayur-Dhyana Sutra." 

Background
"Metaphoric interpretations of the Pure 
Land abound. To some believers, the Land
 of Bliss, the Pure Land, is an ideal 
state of being. Some regard Pure Land as
 the Pure Mind. I read the two Amitabha 
<pb n="635"/>
Sutras as stories told for many ends. 
They entertain and delight, they 
generate images of wonder and hope, they
 speak of worlds and ideals of the 
spirit. But they are also stories about 
a place, its origin, and its very 
concrete way of being. Hence, it is 
difficult, if not impossible, to read 
the two sutras without envisioning the 
place. One would like to draw -- in the 
imagination and on paper -- the layout 
of purified buddha-fields, trying to 
depict those features that make them 
unique, different from those world 
systems that are easily schematized. 
Pure Land believers have envisioned such
 worlds. (The Taima Mandala/ q.v.) is 
one example of the fruits of this 
exercise in imagination. It claims to 
represent the Pure Land of Amitabha as 
depicted in the Meditation Sutra.
Yet, in some ways the two Amitabha 
Sutras challenge the imagination by 
refusing to close this image of a place,
 a land, or a world. Unlike the 
scholastic cosmographies, the sutras do 
not give dimensions, nor do they give us
 all the details as to the location of 
each feature and event in the Land of 
Bliss. This is as it should be, because 
<pb n="636"/>
this land is a world of many wonders, 
occuring in different parts, at 
different times...and the Land is, like 
the sutras, an ever-changing panorama, a
 flowing array of marvels. 
The two Amitabha Sutras, in particular 
the Longer Sutra, present us with images
 of a buddha-field that coalesce in a 
single narrative and evoke concrete 
visions of a paradisiacal land, yet 
never quite give us a final or closed 
map of this land. Unlike traditional 
cosmographies, which seem to have 
required a closed world with definite 
dimensions and borders, the geographies 
of Sukhavati tell us more about the ways
 in which it is not like a normal world 
system than they do about how this 
alternative world is laid out and 
defined. Traditional representations of 
the Pure Land seldom depict boundaries, 
never assume the Pure Land must have a 
foundation or closure above or around 
its gardens." 

"Whatever differences scholars may find 
between the Three Pure Land Sutras (q.v.
), they are regarded as complementary by
 Pure Land practitioners. The picture (
literally, for it appears often in Pure 
<pb n="637"/>
Land Buddhist art) that then emerges is 
somewhat as follows: Far beyond the 
setting sun, beyond all the troubles of 
Samsara, there is an intensely beautiful
, sparklingly pure realm called 
Sukhavati, the Land of Unalloyed 
Happiness. It is ruled over by an all-
wise and all compassionate Buddha whose 
life and wisdom are immeasurable, and 
who is therefore called both Amitayus 
and Amitabha or, for short, just 
Amitabha ('Immeasurable'). He sits on an
 immense throne, higher than many cosmic
 mountains, and although he himself is 
dressed in the simple robes of a monk, 
his throne is richly hung with draperies
 and set with rare jewels. On either 
side of him are his chief Bodhisattvas, 
the greatly compassionate Avalokitesvara
 and the greatly powerful 
Mahasthamaprapta, and in front of him is
 a lake covered with lotus buds 
continually opening to reveal those 
newly born into Sukhavati. All around 
him are jeweled palaces, jeweled trees, 
and lakes full of jewel-like and 
perfumed water, and the air is filled 
with divine music and heavenly incense. 
All the inhabitants, once they fully 
emerge from their lotus buds, are great 
<pb n="638"/>
Bodhisattvas only one lifetime away from
 perfect liberation and they have 
beautiful, ethereal bodies, as if '
walking in an Air of glory'. The land is
 flat and even, without boundaries or 
obstacles, and as limitless as space. If
 one wishes to be reborn in that 
marvelous place, one does not have to 
leave home and become a monk or nun, or 
meditate far into the night. One merely 
has to focus one's mind... on Amitabha 
and Sukhavati, and recite Nam-mo O-mi-t'
o fo! at least ten times [singlemindedly
 at the time of death). Then because of 
the wonderfully powerful fruiting of his
 Bodhisattva Resolve, Amitabha Buddha 
will ensure that one is reborn in his 
realm, and one can proceed without delay
 to one's own enlightenment and then 
quickly return to Samsara to help other 
beings, until Samsara is emptied." 
NOTE:
 There is a 1996 English language 
edition of the Longer and Shorter 
Amitabha Sutras entitled the Land of 
Bliss. Each sutra is translated with 
commentaries and notes from both the 
Sanskrit and Chinese by Luis O. Gomez (
University of Michigan).

<_-xa>Ananda</_-xa>

"The words 'Thus have I heard' always 
precede the exposition of a Buddhist 
sutra. They are spoken by Ananda, the 
Buddha's personal assistant and serve to
 authenticate the sutras. 

The question is asked, 'Why does Ananda 
who has realized the status of the Sages
 still speak of a "self ... It is as 
explained by Nagarjuna: 

<pb n="646"/>
'There are three ways of speaking about 
the self. The first speaks of a self 
based on the perverted view of the self 
... The second speaks of a self based on
 pride (mana) ... The third claims an 
existence of the self in accordance with
 the ways of the world; this refers to 
those whose perverted views and pride 
have been eliminated, but for the 
purposes of propagation proclaim the 
self in accordance with the ways of the 
world.' 
Thus, here in this case, when Ananda 
assembled the teachings of the Buddha, 
he dwelt in (the saintly stage of) Non-
trainers, having eliminated perverted 
views and pride. Only in order to

<_-xa>Esoteric school</_-xa>

"Also called Vajrayana, Tantric Buddhism
 and Lamaism. Type of Esoteric Buddhism 
found principally in Tibet, also now 
found in Mongolia, India, and parts of 
China. It is hierarchical and presided 
over by the Dalai Lama and the Panchen 
Lama." 

(I) Historical Developments
"Buddhism was introduced into Tibet 
about 640 A.D. but made little progress 
until Padmasambhava arrived in the 
eighth century when, it seems, that he 
introduced the Vinaya Rules, some 
Yogacara doctrines, and something of the
 Tantras of Bengal. A period of 
translation followed, but the newly 
established religion degenerated until 
in the eleventh century Atisa reformed 
the existing Buddhism. and founded the 
Kahdam-pa Order. At about the same time,
 Marpa and Milarepa founded the Kargyut-
pa school, and the Nyingma-pa appears as
<pb n="648"/>
 an organized school. In the fifteenth 
century, Tsong-kha-pa carried out 
sweeping reforms and founded his own 
Gelugpa Order, the Yellow Hats, to which
 the Dalai and Panchen Lama of the day 
belong. Tantric ritual plays a large 
part in all the Orders or Schools, and 
all levels of spiritual development are 
to be found, from the indigenous Bon to 
the greatest heights of spirituality 
achieved by man." 

(II) Recent Developments
"The Tibetan diaspora (that followed the
 occupation of Tibet by China in the 
1950's) initiated a new period in the 
history of the study of Tibetan Buddhism
 in the west ... Native Tibetan works 
published by the refugees accumulated in
 depository libraries across the United 
States as a result of Public Law 480, 
under the terms of which the huge debts 
owed by the government of India to the 
United States for shipments of American 
wheat provided for famine relief would 
be repaid in the form of books. 
Specifically, a designated number of 
copies of every book published in India 
was to be provided to the Library of 
Congress, which would then distribute 
<pb n="649"/>
them to the depository libraries. In 
this way, the long mysterious Tibetan 
archives became as if magically manifest
 in the stacks of American university 
libraries. There was constant reference 
during this period to the present 
perilous state of how it differed from '
pre-1959 Tibet.' The change was indeed 
profound. Although Lhasa had been 
occupied by foreign armies before and 
the previous Dalai Lama had gone into 
exile to escape foreign troops, both 
British and Chinese, this has been the 
longest exile of a Dalai Lama from Tibet
 ever, and the damage done to Buddhist 
institutions in Tibet has been far 
greater than any before in history. 
Drastic changes have occurred and yet 
the reactions they elicited in western 
students of Tibetan Buddhism are not to 
be explained simply by taking account of
 the events of the day; it was not 
simply the fact of change that brought 
forth such reactions. The story is told 
in a Buddhist sutra of a lone blind 
tortoise who dwells in the depths of a 
vast ocean, coming up for air once every
 hundred years (to
represent the difficulty of human 
rebirth in a land where the Dharma is 
<pb n="650"/>
preached). Western students of Buddhism 
imbibed this rhetoric of urgency from 
the Buddhist texts they studied. This 
attempt to partake (of the Buddhist 
teachings before they disappeared with 
the death of the old masters) marked a 
new phase in the history of western 
urgency about Tibet. Here, unlike with 
Desideri or Waddell, the aim of study is
 not to defeat Tibetan Buddhism in 
ideological battle; instead, Buddhist 
doctrine is sympathetically regarded as 
valuable because of its salvific powers 
for the modern world, its own myths 
enlisted in the crusade for its 
preservation."

existence" 

"Tolerance (insight) that comes from the
 knowledge that all phenomena are unborn
. A Mahayana Buddhist term for the 
insight into emptiness, the non-
origination or birthlessness of things 
or beings realized by Bodhisattvas who 
have attained the eighth Stage (Bhumi/
Ground) of the path to Buddhahood. When 
a Bodhisattva realizes this insight, he 
has attained the stage of Non-
Retrogression." (Ryukoku University)
"In the process of practicing the Buddha
's teaching, there is a stage where one 
<pb n="652"/>
recognizes, accepts, and complies with 
the truth that there is no self-
substance in any dharma, even though one
 may not yet have fully realized the 
prajna truth. When one goes a step 
further and realizes fully this truth of
 suchness, he is said to have attained 
the Realization of
the Non-Arising of Dharmas (Tolerance of
 Non-Birth)." 

"Rest in the imperturbable reality which
 is beyond birth and death and which 
requires a patient endurance without 
which thoughts will arise endlessly. The
 Prajna paramita treatise defines it as 
the unflinching faith and imperturbed 
abiding in the underlying reality of all
 things, which is beyond creation and 
destruction. It must be realized before 
attainment of Buddhahood." 
NOTE: 
The Pure Land school teaches that anyone
 reborn in the Pure Land attains the 
Tolerance of Non-Birth and reaches the 
stage of Non-Retrogression, never to 
fall back into Samsara. Thus rebirth in 
the Pure Land is the immediate goal of 
Pure Land practitioners while Buddhahood
 is the ultimate goal.

(I) Famous Translators In Mahayana 
See:1/ An-Shi-Kao; 2/ Bodhiruci; 3/ 
Kumarajiva; 4/ Hsuan-Tsang
(II) Problems/ Opportunities
"For an average person to reach an 
acceptable proficiency as a translator, 
<pb n="654"/>
some twenty years of intensive study and
 meditation would constitute a bare 
minimum." 

"A Buddhist translator looks at the 
scriptures as medicine to cure the 
mental diseases of humans, not as a work
 of mainly historical and philological 
interest that has its place in the field
 of knowledge like every other subject. 
The Buddha himself compared the Dharma 
to medicine quite frequently. When such 
a translator chooses the texts he likes 
to work on, he is inclined to take those
 texts in the first place that are most 
needed as a foundation for the path to 
liberation. His decision does not depend
 on the curriculum of a university or 
financial considerations." 

"Professor Griffiths' point about the 
responsibilities of a Buddhologist is 
that one should contextualize the text, 
both within the tradition it comes out 
of, and within the corpus of writings of
 the author. I think that he is quite 
right. We are translating not only into 
the language of the West but into the 
culture of the West, and in so doing we 
are bound by the conventions and 
<pb n="655"/>
expectations of that culture. Western 
culture (and I use this term with 
reservation, since it now dominates far 
more than simply the West) has become an
 historical one; we see the world in 
historical terms and we need context. 
Further, in translating into English, we
 are bound by the scholarly standards of
 Western culture. (Buddhists) may not 
have written their texts with footnotes,
 with explanations of technical terms 
and unclear referents, with reference to
 the Sanskrit of a passage even where 
available, but we, in translating into 
the idiom of our culture, must." 

"As for concluding procedures (after a 
translation is completed), generally I 
try to pass the final manuscript around 
to a few fellow translators for their 
appraisal; and then try to have a few 
literati friends who know little or 
nothing about... Buddhism read through 
the material, to see if it works as 
literature in the unreal world of the 
urban concrete jungle." 
NOTE:
"The restriction to one tradition and 
interpretation is sometimes more useful 
for the spiritual progress of the 
<pb n="656"/>
practitioner than the mixing of various 
traditions in one work. Furthermore, a 
translator who is a practicing Buddhist 
considers his spiritual experience 
derived from his faithful practice in 
prayer, meditation and debate as an 
important condition to complete his 
understanding of the texts."

"The Buddha's teachings form a canon 
known as the Tripitaka, or 'three 
baskets,' because they were divided into
 three categories: the Sutras (sermons 
of the Buddha); the Vinaya (precepts and
 rules of monastic discipline); and the 
Abhidharma (commentarial literature on 
the Buddha's teachings). There are two 
major sets of Tripitaka or canon: the 
Theravada canon written in Pali, and the
 Mahayana canon written in Sanskrit and 
preserved in Chinese and Tibetan. The 
Mahayana canon includes all the texts of
 the Theravada canon in addition to its 
own sutras and commentaries. The best 
known edition of the Mahayana canon is 
the Japanese Taisho edition (see below).
"

(I) Background
"After the death of Gautama it became 
necessary to establish his teaching 
clearly and gather it in a coherent form
. So a few months later a council was 
held in Rajagha (India), and its 
conclusions were reviewed 100 years 
<pb n="661"/>
later, at the second Buddhist council in
 Vesali. The crucial meeting, however, 
was the third, which met in Pataliputta 
in 253 BC, more than 200 years after 
Gautama's death, under the patronage of 
Emperor Asoka. A thousand monks were 
occupied for nine months in checking, 
completing and finally classifying the 
traditions that had been passed down. At
 this stage the material was still in 
spoken form; it was not until the first 
century BC, on the island of Sri Lanka, 
that the first Buddhist scriptures were 
written down. This basic collection of 
writings is called the Pali canon, after
 the language in which it was written. 
It forms the main body of teaching for 
the conservative Theravada Buddhists; 
other groups (such as the Mahayanists) 
have additional writings... (For details
, see Buddhist Councils)
"(In addition to the Pali Tripitaka), 
other Tripitakas were also written by 
other schools in Sanskrit, containing 
the same three baskets but a somewhat 
different set of contents. They now 
survive mainly in Chinese and Tibetan 
translations (and are known as the 
Mahayana Tripitaka). The Mahayana 
tradition accepts the Pali Tripitaka, 
<pb n="662"/>
but sees it as a preparation for its own
 Mahayana sutras which, so to speak, 
fill the three baskets of the Pali Canon
."

(II) The Mahayana Canon
"Mahayana Buddhists recognize many more 
texts as authoritative than do the more 
traditionalist Theravada Buddhists. 
Among these are the two Amitabha Sutras 
(Sukhavativyuha); the 'Lotus Sutra' (
Sadharmapundarika) particularly used by 
the T'ien T'ai school; the 'Revelation 
of the Teaching in Lanka' (Lankavatara);
 and, above all, the 'Perfection of 
Wisdom Sutra' (Prajnaparamita-Sutra), a 
comprehensive explanation of the state 
of being a Buddha. Some of these 
writings are geared to practical piety; 
others are more philosophically oriented
. Whole schools of thought gathered 
around the various manuals or sutras, 
and then wrote their own teaching books 
(sastras), to give a thorough grounding 
in Buddhism." 

(III) Taisho (Taisho Shinshu Daizokyo):
"The Taisho Issaikyo is the name of a 
Japanese edition in 85 volumes of all 
Buddhist Scriptures extant in Chinese 
<pb n="663"/>
collected by J. Takakusu in 1924-32. 
Generally adopted (by Western scholars) 
as superseding earlier compilations. The
 Taisho edition is usually quoted as T."
 

"In the Taisho edition, the division of 
the Buddhist Canon is as follows: 
Vols.1-21 -- Translations of the 
discourses (sutras) of the Buddha 
Vols. 22-24 -- Translations of the 
Vinaya (precepts) 
Vols. 25-29 -- Translations of the 
Abhidharma (commentaries) 
Vols. 30-31 - Translations of Madhyamika
 and Vijnanavada texts 
Vol. 32 -- Translations of sastras or 
treatises 
Vols. 33-43 -- Commentaries written by 
Chinese masters 
Vols. 44-48 -- The literature of the 
various Chinese schools of Buddhism 
Vols. 49-52 -- Historical records, such 
as biographies, annals, travel accounts,
 Chinese polemical literature 
Vols. 53-54 -- Encyclopedias and 
glossaries 
Vol. 55 -- Buddhist catalogues of sutras
." 

<pb n="664"/>
Japanese Buddhism is generally based on 
the Chinese version of the Tripitaka, 
which at least until recently could be 
read by educated Japanese. 
NOTE:
"Thirty-one Sanskrit texts and over two 
hundred Chinese and Tibetan translations
 refer to Amitabha and/or Sukhavati (in 
the Mahayana Tripitaka). For example, 
the author of the Treatise on the Buddha
-womb Theory concludes his highly '
technical' work on the tathagatagarbha (
Buddha-womb or embryo) doctrine by 
stating: 'By the merit I have acquired 
through (writing) this (treatise), may 
all living beings come to perceive the 
Lord Amitabha endowed with infinite 
light.' Such references attest to the 
influence wielded by Pure Land thought 
in the devotional lives of the 
commentators."

"The world of desire, the world of form 
and the world of formlessness (q.v.). 
The realms inhabited by unenlightened 
beings ... 
(1) The world of desire is so called 
because its inhabitants are ruled by 
various desires, representative of which
 are the desire for food and sex. It 
comprises the Four Evil Paths (Hell, 
Hungry Ghosts, Animality and Asura) (and
 the two Paths of humans and celestials)
.
(2) Beings in the world of form have 
material form but are free from desires.
 This world consists of the four 
meditation (Skt./ dhyana) heavens, which
 are further subdivided into eighteen 
heavens (sixteen or seventeen according 
to other explanations).
(3) The world of formlessness is free 
both from desire and from the 
restrictions of matter. It has four non-
<pb n="666"/>
substantial realms." 

"According to Buddhist teaching if a 
sentient being is not enlightened and 
has not escaped Birth and Death, he is 
revolving within the Three Realms (the 
Realm of Desire, the Realm of Form, and 
the Realm of Formlessness). Sentient 
beings living in the Realm of Desire 
possess lust, hatred, jealousy, 
infatuation, and other passions. Within 
this realm there are six
different planes of existence: gods, 
humans, asuras, animals, hungry ghosts, 
and hell-dwellers. The Realm of Form 
contains sixteen heavens inhabited by 
various celestial beings who have 
certain accomplishments in one of the 
four dhyanas of form. The Realm of 
Formlessness has four heavens, inhabited
 by those with different accomplishments
 in one of the four dhyanas of 
formlessness. The heavens both in the 
Realm of Form and in that of 
Formlessness are classified according to
 the depth of dhyana (meditation) 
attained in their former lives by the 
celestial beings who dwell there."

"If we refer to existence, then/ 
Everything from the smallest mote of 
dust exists;/ If we refer to emptiness,/
 This whole, wide world and everything 
in it are empty." 
Amatamsaka (Chap: 39)
"Since both material and metaphysical 
generosity are produced by knowledge of 
emptiness and baselessness, when 
countless beings came from various lands
 seeking what they desired from Vidvan (
one of Sudhana's spiritual teachers in 
the Avatamsaka Sutra), he looked up to 
the sky, and all they wanted descended 
from the sky; and he taught them truths 
according to their faculties." 

Amitabha Sutra
"This (Amitabha) Sutra is a Mahayana 
Dharma ... and takes the Real Mark as 
its substance. The Real Mark is no mark.
 There is no mark, nothing at all, and 
yet there is nothing which is not marked
. Unmarked, it is true emptiness, and 
with nothing unmarked, it is wonderful

<xa>TRUTH</xa>
<_-xa>Existence (Amitabha / Pure Land)</_-xa>; <_-xa>Suchness</_-xa>; <_-xa>True

Please read entry "Two Truths" before 
the following:
"The word Truth usually denotes the 
<pb n="670"/>
ultimate, transcendental truth, or 
emptiness (sunyata); also, Buddha-nature
, or suchness." (Ultimate Truth Vs. 
mundane truth.) 

The truth being one and indivisible in 
Mahayana Buddhist teaching, the "
discriminating" human mind can never 
grasp the whole truth. Thus, such a mind
 is bound to result in an imperfect 
understanding of the world as it really 
is. This is best expressed by the 
parable of several blind men trying to 
describe an elephant, each touching a 
different part of the animal, with no 
one having the total picture. 

"Relative and absolute,/These the two 
truths are declared to be./'The absolute
 is not within the reach of intellect,/
For intellect is grounded in the 
relative." 

The meaning of this is that all 
statements, all theories, anything 
emerging from the operations of the 
rational intelligence, have the nature 
of relative truth. Theories may be of 
practical utility and may concur with 
empirical experience, but as expressions
<pb n="671"/>
 of the absolute truth, the ultimate '
nature of things,' they are inadequate. 
The absolute is supranational and cannot
 be expressed in conceptual terms. Thus,
 in the Majjhima Nikaya, the Buddha is 
recorded as saying that 'the Tathagata 
is free from all theories and again, '
the view that everything exists is, 
Kachchayana, one extreme; that it does 
not exist is another. Not accepting the 
two extremes, the Tathagata proclaims 
the truth from the middle position.' 
This means that any statement claiming 
to encapsulate the ultimate truth, any 
formulation that points to 'this' or '
that' as being ultimately real, is false
-false for the simple reason that it is 
a formulation, emanating from the 
conceptual intelligence." 

D.T. Suzuki quotes the Zen Patriarch Fa 
Yen as follows:
"The sutras preached by the Buddha 
during his lifetime are said to amount 
to five thousand and forty-eight 
fascicles; they include the doctrine of 
emptiness and the doctrine of being (
existence); there are teachings of 
immedicate realization and of gradual 
development. Is this not an affirmation?
<pb n="672"/>
"But, according to (Zen Master Yun Chia 
in his Song of Enlightenment), 'there 
are no sentient beings, there are no 
Buddhas; sages as numerous as the sands 
of the Ganges are but so many bubbles in
 the sea; sages and worthies of the past
 are like Bashes of lightning.' Is this 
not a negation?
"O you, my disciples, if you say there 
is, you go against (Yung Chia); if you 
say there is not, you contradict our old
 master Buddha. If he were with us, then
 how would he pass through the dilemma? 
... If you confess your ignorance, I 
will let you see into the secret. When I
 say there is not, this does not 
necessarily mean a negation; when I say 
there is, this also does not signify an 
affirmation. Turn eastward and look at 
the Western Land; face the south and the
 North Star is pointed out there!" 
See also: the following passage which 
expresses the highest teaching of 
Buddhism (noumenon level): "According to
 the Hua-yen (Avatamsaka school) 
analysis, every belief represents a 
vision of the truth, as seen from a 
particular standpoint. Therefore it 
cannot contradict, or be contradicted by
, any other belief -- for that too is a 
<pb n="673"/>
vision of the truth, only seen from a 
different standpoint. Nor can a given 
standpoint be right or wrong in itself, 
since, on the one hand (from the 
conventional point of view), being 
partial and limited by definition, it 
cannot be the whole truth; while on the 
other hand (from the ultimate point of 
view), it simultaneously includes all 
other standpoints, and so cannot be less
 than the whole truth. Beliefs are 
mistaken as long as they are supposed to
 be absolutely true, in contrast to 
other beliefs which are then considered 
false. They actually become absolutely 
true only when their relative nature is 
fully realized and there is no longer 
any question of true vs. false." (A.J. 
Prince, The World of Hua-yen Buddhism). 

"What is truth? It is that which helps. 
And conversely, that which helps has the
 ring of truth." 
NOTE:
"Buddha-name recitation is the wondrous 
gate into the Truth. It merges perfectly
 with all schools of Buddhism and 
encompasses all forms of the teaching. 
Its purity and subtlety are unfathomable
, its greatness inexhaustible. Those of 
<pb n="674"/>
dull faculties find it and quickly 
escape from the world of suffering. 
Those of keen intellect encounter it and
 directly pass to the Other Shore..." (
Master Chu Hung in Pure Land Pure Mind)

reform of Tibetan Buddhism. He founded 
the Ganden monastery 26 miles from Lhasa
 and called his new Order the Gelug-pa, 
'the virtuous ones.' To this day the 
senior members wear on important 
occasions a yellow headdress. All others
 still wearing the red hat which, 
however, is usually associated with the 
Red Hat or Nyingma-pa School. 
In the New Order, which replaced the 
Kahdam-pa founded by Atisa, Tsong-kha-pa
 made no great innovations, but 
tightened the discipline, abolished 
alcohol, enforced celibacy, cut down on 
magic and the proliferation of 
divinities, and for his students wrote a
 special set of precepts which are still
 the Order's basic text-book. Both the 
Dalai and the Panchen Lama are members 
of this Order. Other Schools adopted the
 reforms at least in part, being now 
referred to as semi-reformed. Others, e.
g. the Nyingma-pa, remained unaffected."

From the Han Dynasty (206 BC--220 AD), 
an important stage-post at the east end 
of the 'Silk-Road' to Central Asia, it 
became a great Buddhist center and place
 of pilgrimage. In 366 the first of the 
Buddhist cave temples was begun; the 
construction of temples and grottoes 
continued throughout the next millenium,
 until the close of Yuan Dynasty ( 1368)
. At the height of its fame, it boasted 
1,000 grottoes, of which only some 480 
remain, in which have been preserved 
thousands of sculptures and murals, 
recording the triumphs of Buddhist art 
in China. During the Sung Dynasty (960-
1279), when flames of war spread to Tun-
Huang, the monks of the cave temples, 
before taking flight, sealed up their 
scriptures, scrolls and documents in one
 of the caves. These were accidentally

Nihilism</_-xa>

"Two dualistic views expressly rejected 
in Buddhism: l. Nihilism: considering 
that things do not exist in any sense, 
<pb n="683"/>
even the delusory manifestations of the 
world; also, the tenet that nothing 
continues after death, i.e., the denial 
of the doctrine of reincarnation. 2. 
Eternalism: believing that there is true
 existence of real being in objects, or 
that there is some entity that exists 
forever." 



<xa>TWO</xa>
<_-xa>Bhiksu</_-xa>

"Rules of discipline to be observed by 
fully ordained monks. They consist of 
eight groups: 
(1) The four unpardonable offenses (Skt.
/ parajika) of killing, theft, sexual 
intercourse and lying, particularly, 
claiming to have attained insight or 
understanding that one does not in fact 
possess. A monk who commits one or 
another of these offenses is expelled 
from the Order. 
(2) Thirteen major prohibitions (Samgha-
Avashesha). Monks who violate these are 
divested of membership in the Order for 
a certain period. 
(3) Prohibitions relating to offenses 
<pb n="684"/>
which are committed either in a place 
where one can be seen or in a place 
where one cannot. For example, this type
 of prohibition includes the offense of 
being alone with a woman, either in a 
place where one can be seen or in a 
place where one cannot. This third group
 comprises two of the two hundred and 
fifty precepts. These rules are called 
the indeterminate (aniyata) group 
because the punishment for going against
 them varies according to the 
circumstances. 
(4) Thirty standards (naihisargika-
prayashchittika), whose violation is 
said to cause one to fall into the three
 evil paths. 
(5) Ninety standards (shuddha-
prayashchittika), violation of which 
requires public confession. 
(6) Four lesser standards (
pratideshaniya), the breaking of which 
requires confession when one becomes 
aware of his error. (7) One hundred very
 minor standards (Shaiksha-dharma), 
which are easily broken but which should
 be borne in mind for one's self-
development. 
(8) Seven rules (adhikarana-shamatha) 
for settling disputes within the Order."
<pb n="685"/>
 



<xa>TWO</xa>
"Personal self and phenomenal self, 
which are the ultimately non-existent 
objects we perceive as the essential 
core of persons and things." 



<xa>TWO</xa>
"The stores of merit and of wisdom; all 
deeds of Bodhisattvas contribute to 
their accumulation of these two stores, 
which ultimately culminate in the two 
bodies of the Buddha, the body of form 
and the ultimate body." 



<xa>TWO</xa>
<_-xa>Truth</_-xa>

"The superficial truth and the ultimate 
truth, or the relative truth and the 
absolute truth, or the conventional 
truth and the supreme truth." 

<pb n="686"/>
"1) Relative or conventional everyday 
truth of the mundane world subject to 
delusion and dichotomies and 2) the 
Ultimate Truth, transcending dichotomies
, as taught by the Buddhas. According to
 Buddhism, there are two kinds of truth,
 the Absolute and the Relative. The 
Absolute Truth (of the Void) manifests '
illumination but is always still,' and 
this is absolutely inexplicable. On the 
other hand, the Relative Truth (of the 
Unreal) manifests 'stillness but is 
always illuminating,' which means that 
it is immanent in everything." (Hsu Heng
 Chi/P.H. Wei).

"The Two Truths were generally appealed 
to as a vehicle for authenticating 
expedient practices, but eventually they
 coalesced into an ultimate affirmation 
of the non-duality of True Reality, of 
which the Two Truths are but a function.
" Saso: 49 NOTE: Pure Land thinkers, 
such as the Patriarch Tao Ch'o, accepted
 "the legitimacy of conventional Truth 
as an expression of Ultimate Truth and 
as a vehicle to reach Ultimate Truth. 
Even though all form is non-form, it is 
acceptable and necessary to use form 
within the limits of causality, because 
<pb n="687"/>
its use is an expedient means of saving 
others out of one's compassion for them 
and because, even for the unenlightened,
 the use of form can lead to the 
revelation of form as non-form" (David 
Chappell). Thus to reach Buddhahood, 
which is formless, the cultivator can 
practice the Pure Land method based on 
form.

story of Maudgalyayana, who thanks to 
his 'divine eye' saw that his mother had
 been reborn as a hungry ghost, and he 
wanted to save her. The Buddha told him 
that only the combined effort of all 
Buddhist monks could (help her escape 
her fate). From this tradition developed
 the custom of offering food, clothing, 
and so on to the (clergy on Ullambana, 
the date of which coincides with the end

whole of Buddhism. In effect 'ultimatism
<pb n="690"/>
' discards, ignores or even rejects step

particular teaching. This is a perennial
 possibility, frequent also in the 
history of Mahayana Buddhism. In 
Southern Buddhism today it takes the 
form of a rejection of much traditional 
practice and ceremonies as well as many 
of the outward forms customarily 
associated with merit-making activities.
" 
NOTE: 
For a glimpse of why we should not 
blindly borrow the words of the sages or
 emulate their extraordinary actions, 
see the following passage concerning 
Kumarajiva, the renowned T'ang Dynasty 
monk (who skillfully translated some 
thirty-five sutras into Chinese): "When 
Kumarajiva went to China in the fourth 
century of this era, the Chinese Emperor
 thought that such a wise person ought 
to have descendents so that his wisdom 
would carry on. He gave concubines to 
Kumarajiva, and since they were a royal 
gift, Kumarajiva had no choice but to 
accept them. Afterwards, his disciples 
asked, 'Can we have relations with women
 too?'
Kumarajiva said, Sure, but first, let me
<pb n="691"/>
 show you something.' He took a handful 
of needles and ate them as easily as if 
they were noodles. When he finished, he 
said, 'If you can do that, then you can 
have relations with women.' (Sheng-yen,

impure persons who develop the Bodhi 
Mind, seek rebirth and constantly 
practice Buddha Recitation can subdue 
and destroy afflictions, achieve rebirth
 in the Pure Land and, depending on 
their level of cultivation, obtain a 
vision of the rudimentary aspects of the
 Buddha (the thirty-two marks of

"The Pure Land tradition embraces people
 of all capacities -- whether limited, 
moderate or high. Sentient beings of 
limited and moderate capacities who 
recite the Buddha's name can rid 
themselves of afflictions and karmic 
<pb n="694"/>
obstacles and develop merit, virtue and 
wisdom, leading in time to the state of 
samadhi. They will then be reborn within
 the nine 'lotus grades' in the Land of 
Ultimate Bliss, the exact grade 
depending on the amount of effort they 
exert in cultivation. Those of high 
capacities, on the other hand, enter 
deeply into the state of samadhi and 
wisdom as soon as they begin uttering 
the Buddha's name. Whether walking, 
standing, lying down or sitting, they 
are always in the 'Buddha Recitation 
Samadhi.' After death they will be 
reborn in the highest lotus grade. Some 
of the sages of old who entered this 
realm described it in the following 
terms: 'Holding the rosary, I am rid of 
worldly thoughts,/ Suddenly, I already 
became a Buddha a long time ago.'
Pure Land embraces people of all levels.
 For those of high capacities it is a 
sublime method; for those of limited 
capacities it turns into a simple method
. (It is thus a universal method, a 
Mahayana method.)" 
"This Dharma-Gate (method) of buddha-
name recitation does not discriminate 
between wise and ignorant, or high 
ranking and lowly, or rich and poor. It 
<pb n="695"/>
does not distinguish between male and 
female or old and young or monks and 
nuns and laypeople. It does not matter 
if you have practiced it for a long time
 or have just recently started. Everyone
 can recite the buddha-name. The 
guidelines for reciting the buddha-name 
are not rigid. You can recite the buddha
-name in a loud voice or a low voice, 
while doing ablutions or while making 
prostrations. You can recite the buddha-
name while gathering in the mind, while 
meditating, while contemplating the 
concept of buddha, while counting beads.
 You can recite the buddha-name while 
walking or standing or sitting quietly 
or lying on your side. You can recite 
the buddha-name silently or aloud. You 
can recite the buddha-name a thousand 
times or ten thousand times. It is all 
the same mindfulness of buddha. The only
 thing that is essential is to have 
definite faith, and to seek birth in the
 Pwe Land. If you can actually practice 
the recitation like this, then there is 
no need to seek elsewhere for an 
enlightened teacher." (Zen Master Tsung-
pen l6th c. China) 
Question: 
"When practicing Pure Land, we need to 
<pb n="696"/>
attain the Buddha Recitation Samadhi, or
 at least reach the stage of 
onepointedness of mind, in order to 
achieve rebirth in the Western Land. 
Those of limited capacities are not 
necessarily able to practice at such a 
level. Therefore, how can these sentient
 beings be reborn in the Land of 
Ultimate Bliss? And, if such persons 
cannot achieve rebirth there, how can 
Buddha Recitation be said to 'gather in'
 all types of people? 
Answer: 
In truth, the capacities of people being
 what they are these days, even one-
pointedness of mind is extremely 
difficult to achieve, not to mention the
 state of Buddha Recitation Samadhi! 
However, according to the Meditation 
Sutra, if anyone who has committed the '
Five Grave Offenses' or 'Ten Evil Deeds'
 sees evil omens appear as he is on the 
verge of death, he need only recite the 
Buddha's name ten times with utter faith
 and sincerity and Buddha Amitabha will 
descend to welcome him and guide him 
back to the Pure Land. Thus, one-
pointedness of mind resulting in rebirth
 in the Pure Land refers to the time of 
death, not the present time. However, in
<pb n="697"/>
 order to achieve such a state of mind 
at the time of death, the cultivator 
should practice Buddha Recitation in 
daily life to the point where it becomes
 second nature. As he constantly recites
 the Buddha's name in daily life, even 
though one-pointedness of mind is not 
yet achieved, the seeds of Buddha 
Recitation are accumulated and stored 
away in great quantities. On his 
deathbed, the practitioner who begins to
 recite 'activates' those seeds 
immediately and with great force, 
resulting in onepointedness of mind. 
Those of limited capacities who achieve 
rebirth in the Pure Land through Buddha 
Recitation usually fall into this 
category." 

"The champions of Pure Land Buddhism 
have always made the case that Pure Land
 methods are especially valuable because
 they are particularly effective in 
meeting the needs of the greatest number
 of people. When we face facts, most of 
us have to admit that we see little 
realistic prospect of achieving 
salvation through the eons of gradual 
practice spoken of in the Buddhist 
scriptures, or the heroic efforts of the
<pb n="698"/>
 Zen masters, or the years of esoteric 
dedication demanded by the Esoteric 
Schools. Pure Land practice, on the 
other hand, is explicitly designed as an
 easy way, open to all" (J.C. Cleary).

"On certain occasions, the Buddha has 
commented on the nature and composition 
of the universe. According to the Buddha
, there are a multitude of other forms 
of life existing in other parts of the 
universe. As a result of today's rapid 
scientific progress, we may soon find 
some living beings on other planets in 
the remotest parts of our galaxy. 
Perhaps, we will find them subject to 
the same laws as ourselves. They might 
be physically quite different in both 
appearance, elements and chemical 
composition, and exist in different 
dimensions. They might be far superior 
to us or they might be far inferior. Why
<pb n="699"/>
 should the planet earth be the only 
planet to contain life forms? Earth is a
 tiny speck in a huge universe. Sir 
James Jeans, the distinguished 
astrophysicist, estimates the whole 
universe to be about one thousand 
million times as big as the area of 
space that is visible through the 
telescope. In his book, The Mysterious 
Universe, he states that the total 
number of "universes" is probably 
something like the total number of 
grains of sand on all the sea shores of 
the world. In such a universe, the 
planet Earth is only one-millionth of a 
grain of sand. He also informs us that 
the light from the sun takes probably 
something like 100,000 million years to 
travel across the universe! Such is the 
vastness of the cosmos. When we consider
 the vastness of the many universes 
making up what is popularly known as '
outer space' the hypothesis that other-
world systems might exist is 
scientifically feasible. In the light of
 modern scientific discoveries, we can 
appreciate the limitations of the human 
world. Today, science has demonstrated 
that our human world exists within the 
limitations of the vibrational 
<pb n="700"/>
frequencies that can be received by our 
sense organs. And science has also shown
 us that there are other vibrational 
frequencies which are above or below our
 range of reception. With the discovery 
of radio waves, X-rays, T.V. waves, and 
microwaves, we can appreciate the 
extremely limited perception that is 
imposed on us by our sense organs. We 
peep at the universe through a 'crack' 
allowed by our sense organs, just as a 
little child peeps out through the crack
 in a door. This awareness of our 
limited perception demonstrates to us 
the possibility that other world systems
 may exist that are separate from ours 
or that interpenetrate with ours. As to 
the nature of the universe, the Buddha 
said that the beginning and ending of 
the universe are inconceivable. 
Buddhists do not believe that the world 
will suddenly end in complete and utter 
destruction. There is no such thing as 
complete destruction of the whole 
universe at once. When a certain section
 of the universe disappears, another 
section remains. When the other section 
disappears, another section reappears or
 evolves out of the dispersed matters of
 the previous universe. This is formed 
<pb n="701"/>
by the accumulation of molecules, basic 
elements, gas and numerous energies, a 
combination supported by cosmic 
implosion and gravity. Then some other 
new world systems appear and exist for 
some time. This is the nature of cosmic 
energies. This is why the Buddha says 
that the beginning and the end of the 
universe are inconceivable. It was only 
on certain special occasions that the 
Buddha commented on the nature and 
composition of the universe. When He 
spoke, He had to address Himself to the 
understanding capacity of the enquirer. 
The Buddha was not interested in the 
kind of metaphysical speculation that 
did not lead to a higher spiritual 
development. Buddhists do not share the 
view held by some people that the world 
will be destroyed by god, when there are
 more non-believers and more corruptions
 taking place amongst human beings. With
 regard to this belief people can ask, 
instead of destroying with his power, 
why can't this god use the same power to
 influence people to become believers 
and to wipe out all immoral practices 
from men's mind? Whether the god 
destroys or not, it is natural that one 
day there will be an end to everything 
<pb n="702"/>
that comes into existence. However, in 
the language of the Buddha, the world is
 nothing more than the combination, 
existence, disappearance, and 
recombination of mind and matter. In the
 final analysis, the Teaching of the 
Buddha goes beyond the discoveries of 
modern science however startling or 
impressive they may be. In science, the 
knowledge of the universe is to enable 
man to master it for his material 
comfort and personal safety. But the 
Buddha teaches that no amount of factual
 knowledge will ultimately free man from
 the pain of existence. He must strive .
.. diligently until he arrives at a true
 understanding of his own nature and of 
the changeable nature of the cosmos. To 
be truly free a man must seek to tame 
his mind, to destroy his craving for 
sensual pleasure. When a man truly 
understands that the universe he is 
trying to conquer is impermanent, he 
will see himself as Don Quixote fighting
 windmills. With this Right View of 
himself, he will spend his time and 
energy conquering his mind and 
destroying his illusion of self."

<_-xa>Good Spiritual Advisors </_-xa>

In the Avatamsaka Sutra, this term 
refers to Bodhisattvas who act as 
friends and benefactors, unbeknownst and
 unsolicited, to all sentient beings. As
 the Avatamsaka Sutra (ch. 21) states:
"The Bodhisattvas also conceive this 
overwhelming determination: 'If I attain
 complete perfect enlightenment first 
without having established all sentient 
beings on the path of unsurpassed 
liberation, I would be violating my 
original vow -that would never do; so I 
should first cause all sentient beings 
to attain Supreme Enlightenment and 
Nirvana Without Remainder and then after
 that fulfill Buddhahood. Why? Sentient 
beings have not asked me to set my mind 
on Enlightenment. I, of my own accord, 
act as an unsolicited friend to sentient
 beings, wishing to first cause all 
beings to fully develop their good 
potential and obtain omniscience."' (T.

<_-xa>Afflictions</_-xa>; <_-xa>Delusion</_-xa>; <_-xa>Four Inverted Views</_-xa>; <_-xa>Wrong views</_-xa>

"Sentient beings, lacking wisdom, always
 live upside down; they mistake the 
impure for the pure, suffering for 
<pb n="708"/>
happiness, impermanence for permanence, 
no-self for self. They then develop 
delusions and become degraded and 
defiled. Therefore, Buddha Sakyamuni 
taught sentient beings the Four Truths (
q.v.) to sever their delusions.
For example, the human excrement that we
 consider fetid and dirty is regarded as
 fragrant, clean and succulent by 
animals such as insects, dogs and pigs -
because of their deluded karma. They 
therefore compete and struggle to gobble
 it up. The defiled desires of this 
world are considered by humans as lovely
 and clean. However, the Gods and 
Immortals see them as foul-smelling, 
dirty and unclean, not unlike the way 
human beings regard dogs and pigs eating
 filthy substances. The various desires 
of sentient beings, defiled and upside 
down, are generally thus. The 
practitioner should strive gradually to 
destroy them." 
Consider the example, adapted from the 
sutras, of worms feeding on rotten 
apples. The worms are running hither and
 thither among the apples, each worm "
elbowing" the others for a better spot, 
a larger piece of the rotten matter. 
They all feel their actions necessary 
<pb n="709"/>
and desirable. They all seem very busy 
and very happy. To us humans, however, 
theirs is indeed a pitiable lot. The 
human condition is the same from the 
viewpoint of celestials, Bodhisattvas 
and Buddhas -- such a pitiful sight 
indeed, whether of beggars or 
presidential hopefuls!

<xa>VAIDEHI，韋提</xa>
<_-xa>Meditation Sutra</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Bimbisara，頻毗娑羅王</_-xa>; <_-xa>Ajatasatru，阿

The Queen of King Bimbisara of Magadha, 
India. It was in response to her 
entreaties that Buddha Shakyamuni 
preached the Meditation Sutra, which 
teaches a series of sixteen 
visualizations (of Amitabha Buddha, the 
Pure Land) leading to rebirth in the 
Land of Ultimate Bliss. 

Background
"Wife of Bimbisara, king of Magadha, and
 the mother of Ajatashatru. She is said 
to have been the sister of King 
Prasenajit of Kosala. According to the 
Kammuryoju (Meditation) Sutra, when 
Ajatashatru imprisoned his father 
Bimbisara and attempted to starve him to
 death, Vaidehi regularly covered her 
body with a mixture of honey and flour 
and went to visit Bimbisara in prison; 
thus the king was able to eat and 
survive. When Ajatashatru discovered 
this, he was enraged and attempted to 
kill his mother but was restrained by 
his ministers Jivaka and Chandra. 
<pb n="712"/>
Instead, Ajatashatru had her confined to
 the interior of the palace. She faced 
Eagle (Vulture) Peak where Shakyamuni 
was preaching and prayed to him. Out of 
compassion for her, the Buddha 
interrupted his preaching and appeared 
in the palace with Ananda and 
Maudgalyayana. At her request, he taught
 her how to reach the Pure Land of 
Amitabha Buddha. On that occasion, 
Vaidehi asked Shakyamuni why she should 
be destined to have a son as evil as 
Ajatashatru, and why Shakyamuni himself 
should have to be associated with 
someone as wicked as Devadatta, but 
these questions are not answered in the 
Meditation (Kammuryoju) Sutra."

regularly associated with the Celestial 
Bodhisattva Samantabhadra. He is also 
noted, in the Chinese scholastic

"Killing sentient beings, including 
<pb n="718"/>
slaughtering animals for food, is among 
the heaviest transgressions in Buddhism.
 This is not only because such acts 
create untold pain and suffering but 
also because they cut short the lives of
 future Buddhas (as all sentient beings 
have a common Buddha-nature). The 
injunction against all forms of killing 
(including suicide), covering all 
sentient beings, is unique to Buddhism. 
Jainism, for example, approves of the 
penance of death by self-starvation (
suicide), while Hindu ceremonies such as
 the Srauta rites 'center on offering 
into the altar fires, oblations of milk,
 butter, honey ... domestic animals (
sacrifice) ..."' (K. Crim, Dictionary of
 Religions, p.369 and 790, respectively.
) 

"Animals have just as much right to life
 as we on this earth that we share in 
common, and therefore we have nn right 
to destroy them at our whim. Moreover, 
since in our ascent and descent on the 
ladder of innumerable lives (according 
to causes and conditions) our Buddha-
nature assumes many forms -- all of 
which are aspects of oneself -- to 
destroy any life form is to destroy a 
<pb n="719"/>
part of oneself." 

Question/Answer
"Student: The Lankavatara and Surangama 
Sutras -- both Mahayana scriptures -- 
are quite eloquent in their condemnation
 of meat-eating... What reasons do they 
give? 
Master: That there is not one being 
which in its karmic evolution and 
devolution through countless rebirths, 
has not been our mother, our father, 
husband or wife, sister, brother, son, 
or daughter -- not one being whose 
kinship with us, even while living in 
the animal state, has not continued. How
 then can any spiritual person who 
approaches all living things as if they 
were himself eat the flesh of something 
that is of the same nature as himself? 
Seen this way, isn't all flesh-eating a 
form of cannibalism? How can anyone who 
seeks liberation from suffering inflict 
pain directly or indirectly on another 
creature? Those who eat the flesh of an 
animal obviously enjoy it, so in effect 
they are deriving pleasure from the 
death of another living being." 

"To intentionally deprive any living 
<pb n="720"/>
being, but especially a human being, of 
life will produce painful karma. 
Slaughterers as well as hunters and 
fishermen -especially those motivated by
 sport alone -- inevitably incur a heavy
 karma. Those who do experimental 
research on animals, often depriving 
them of their lives, also risk painful 
karma. The destruction of animals in 
such experimentation is justified on the
 ground that it is the only way by which
 to gain information vital to the health
 and welfare of human beings. 
Unfortunately, much animal 
experimentation today is undertaken 
without consideration of alternative, 
more humane methods. Such an unfeeling 
attitude may arise from the belief that 
animals, being less developed than man, 
suffer less. But who would deny that 
animals, too, suffer pain acutely and 
try to avoid it as much as humans? And 
precisely because their minds are less 
complex than man's and they are more 
intuitive, animals are more sensitive to
 impending violence and pain, which 
generates in them fear that prolongs 
their suffering. Porphyry, a Greek 
philosopher of the fourth century, wrote
 that anyone who had heard the scream of
<pb n="721"/>
 an animal being slaughtered could never
 again eat animal flesh." 

"For inhabitants of polar regions, 
vegetarianism would indeed be attachment
 -- and one that would cost them their 
lives... But those of us living in 
modern, industrialized countries in 
North America, Europe, and Asia are 
blessed with a vast array of food 
choices. Most of us are able to obtain 
an abundance of nonflesh foods that can 
keep us robustly healthy our whole lives
. With such a variety of nonanimal foods
 available, who would choose to support 
the slaughter mills and foster the 
misery involved in factory farming, by 
continuing to eat flesh? There are those
 who fear that without meat or fish 
their health would suffer (the irony!), 
others who may be unaware of how 
enormously the meat industry contributes
 to the misuse and waste of global 
resources ... Can we maintain a nonmeat 
diet for reasons of compassion and still
 be free of attachment to it? In the 
Platform Sutra, the Chinese patriarch 
Hui Neng relates that after inheriting 
the Dharma from the Fifth Patriarch, he 
spent years in seclusion with a group of
<pb n="722"/>
 hunters. At mealtimes, 'he tells us, '
they cooked meat in the same pot with 
the vegetables. If I was asked to share,
 I replied, 'I will just pick the 
vegetables out of the meat. Was he, then
, attached to vegetarianism? And if 
refraining from eating flesh foods is 
itself an 'attachment,' does it follow 
that refusing to give up flesh foods 
shows nonattachment? It is sad to see 
how many American Buddhists are managing
 to find a self-satisfying accommodation
 to eating meat. Some airily cite the 
doctrine of Emptiness, insisting that 
ultimately there is no killing and no 
sentient beings being killed. Others 
find cover behind the excuse that taking
 life is the natural order of things and
, after all, 'the life of a carrot and 
that of a cow are equal.' The truth is 
though, that as humans we are endowed 
with discriminating minds that we can 
use to educate ourselves to the 
implications of our volitional acts and 
to choose those foods that minimize 
suffering to living beings. Our 
aspiration in Mahayana Buddhism, 
inasmuch as we can speak of an 
aspiration, is to liberate our innate 
compassion and fulfill the Bodhisattva 
<pb n="723"/>
Vows. In the first of those vows, 'All 
beings, without number, I vow to 
liberate,' we commit our compassion to 
all beings, not just humans. Eschewing 
meat is one way to express that 
commitment to the welfare of other 
creatures. Once we leave habitual 
preferences behind and forgo nimble 
rationalizations, the issue of 
vegetarianism comes down to a question 
of need. If you need to eat flesh foods 
to sustain your life or, in extreme 
cases, your health, do so, and do so 
with awareness and gratitude. But if you
 don't, why contribute to unnecessary 
suffering?"

On the question of vegetarianism, the 
magazine Vegetarian Times commissioned a
 survey in 1992 which showed that 12.4 
million persons in the United States and
 Canada considered themselves vegetarian
. There were in 1993 some 114 local 
vegetarian associations in the US and 
Canada, nearly double the number five 
years earlier. The largest groups are 
the Toronto Vegetarian Association in 
Canada (600 members) and the Vegetarian 
Society of Colorado, USA (500 members). 
(From Vegetarian Times, May 1993.) 
<pb n="724"/>

NOTE: 
"Funeral arrangements should be kept 
simple, not accompanied by superfluous 
ceremonies occasioning unnecessary 
expenses. Another caveat: only 
vegetarian food should be served. No non
-vegetarian food should be provided as 
offerings or to entertain guests -- for 
to take life is to sadden the departed 
with more karmic obstructions and 'heavy
 baggage,' making his liberation that 
much more difficult. Even if he has 
already been reborn in the Pure Land, 
his grade of rebirth may be lowered as a
 result. ... As stated in the 
Ksitigharba Sutra: The dead one might be
 due to receive a good retribution and 
be born among men and gods in his next 
life or in the future, but because of 
offenses committed by his family in his 
name, his good rebirth will be delayed. 
Everyone must undergo the Evil Paths in 
accordance with his own deeds; it is 
even more unbearable when survivors add 
to those deeds."

<xa>VIETNAM</xa>
<_-xa>Immolation</_-xa>

"Buddhism may have been introduced to 
Vietnam by sea as early as the first 
century. By the second century, Chinese 
sources record a flourishing Buddhist 
Community in Tonguing (northern Vietnam)
. (Two monks in particular were active 
during the 2nd/3rd century, Mau-Bac (Mou
-po) and Khutong-Tang-Hoi (K'ang Seng 
Hui).) The history of Vietnamese 
Buddhism as such, however, begins in 580
, with the arrival of Vinitaruci, an 
Indian monk who had studied with the 
<pb n="727"/>
third patriarch of Chinese Chan Buddhism
, long before its split into northern 
and southern schools. This first lineage
 of vietnamese Zen masters ended with 
the death of its twenty-eighth patriarch
 in 1216, though the Vinitaruci branch 
continues to be prominent, primarily in 
the north. 
The second Zen lineage in Vietnam was 
initiated by the Chinese monk Wu Yen T'
ung (V8-Ngo-Thong, d. 826), who studied 
in China with (the famous Zen Master Pai
-chang, q.v.). This lineage of 
meditation masters also died out in the 
thirteenth century, though again the 
school itself survives. Although these 
first two lineages of Chan Buddhism did 
not survive as lineages, they did lay 
the foundations for a thorough 
integration of Buddhism and Vietnamese 
nationalism which began in the Dinh 
dynasty (969-81). King Dinh-B8-Linh 
established a state-sponsored Vietnamese
 Sangha and initiated the practice of 
appointing eminent monks to advisory 
positions at court, offices formerly 
filled exclusively by Confucian scholars
. 
In the (earlier) Le dynasty (981-1009), 
the first complete Chinese Tripitaka was
<pb n="728"/>
 imported, establishing the scriptural 
basis of Vietnamese Buddhism. 
The Ly dynasty (1010-1225) spanned the 
golden age of Vietnamese independence 
and prosperity. Before this period, 
Vietnam, still confined to Tongking in 
the north, was dominated by the Chinese.
 After this period, Vietnam, though 
expanding in territory, was harassed by 
the Mongols, coveted by the Yuan, Ming, 
and Ch'ing dynasties of China, and 
finally dominated by France. In 1069 the
 Ly dynasty's campaign of southward 
expansion against Champa reached its 
farthest extent, the seventeenth 
parallel. In the course of this campaign
, a very significant prisoner of war was
 brought to Tongking from captured Cham 
territory. This prisoner was the Chinese
 monk Ts'ao Tang (Thao-Dudng), a 
proponent of the Chan-Pure Land 
synthesis, which was prominent at the 
time in Sung dynasty China. With the 
avid support of King Ly Thanh Ton (r.
1054-72), the Chan-Pure Land synthesis 
gained a dominant position among the 
Vietnamese that it maintains to the 
present day... As a part of Vietnam's 
struggle for independence, a movement 
began in 1932 at the Tu-Dam Temple in 
<pb n="729"/>
Hue to consolidate Vietnamese Buddhism. 
This movement resulted first in the 
foundation of the Central Vietnamese 
Buddhist Association in 1932, and then, 
in 1952, the General Association of 
Buddhism in Vietnam (the precursor of 
the Vietnamese Unified Buddhist Congress
 (Giao-Hoi Phat-Giao Viet-Nam Thong-Nhat
), which in 1963 was instrumental in 
bringing down the regime of President 
Ngo Dinh Diem. After the fall of the 
Saigon government in 1975), under the 
Communist regime, a government-
controlled Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam 
was formed. This last development 
entailed government regulation of the 
Sangha ... (a development strenuously 
opposed by the Vietnamese Unified 
Buddhist Congress, through its overseas 
branches)." 

A major achievement of the Unified 
Buddhist Congress was the founding of 
Van Hanh Buddhist University in Saigon 
in 1964. 

Background
"In ancient times the northern region, 
Tongking, was for many centuries a 
province of the Chinese empire. To the 
<pb n="730"/>
south lay the Indianized states of Funan
 and Champa, which then overflowed 
beyond the present-day frontiers. The 
Vietnamese themselves originated in the 
north, and in time came to dominate the 
whole land. Independence from China was 
gained in the tenth century, but Chinese
 influences continued to exert a 
powerful effect and, in the long run, 
this meant that the standard brand of 
Sri Lankan Theravada that triumphed 
elsewhere in Southeast Asia did not do 
so here; instead, Chinese forms of 
Mahayana Buddhism, notably a successful 
amalgam of Ch'an and Pure Land, 
prevailed until the country fell to the 
Communists in 1975. Since then (the 
influence of Buddhism has remained 
strong, although) from time to time we

world with a national Buddhist 
association (Giao-H8i Phat-Giao Viet-Nam

<xa>VIMALAKIRTI</xa>
<_-xa>Amrapali</_-xa>; <_-xa>Licchavi</_-xa>
; <_-xa>Ultimatism</_-xa>

"The Vimalakirti Nirdesa Sutra in 
Japanese Yuima Kyo, is a philosophic 
dramatic discourse written in India 
about first century A.D., in which basic
 Mahayana principles are presented in 
the form of a conversation between 
famous Buddhist figures and the humble 
householder, Vimalakirti. Translated 
into Chinese by Kumarajiva in 401, it 
became immensely popular in China." 

"A sutra expounded by the Buddha on 
Vimalakirti, or 'Spotless Reputation', 
name of a native of Vaisali, said to be 
an avatar of 'The Golden Grain Tathagata
' appearing in the form of a layman to 
assist Sakyamuni Buddha in converting 
people to the Mahayana doctrine."

"(Vimalakirti was) a wealthy man of 
Vaishali ... who represents the Mahayana
 lay believer. According to the sutra, 
he had mastered the profound doctrines 
<pb n="733"/>
of Mahayana and instructed the people by
 various skillful means. The sutra 
depicts him as refuting the Theravada 
views of Shakyamuni's disciples with 
devastating eloquence and preaching 
Mahayana doctrines to them on the basis 
of his understanding of emptiness or non
-substantiality."

"To understand the traditional 
popularity of the vimalakirti Sutra as a
 Mahayana text, one need only look to 
its 'hero,' who is neither the Buddha 
nor a monk, but a wealthy householder. 
Vimalakirti was a family man living 
fully in, but not of, the world, and his
 spiritual stature is said to have been 
second only to that of the Buddha. The 
sutra's profundity, its lively spirit 
and humor, and its constant emphasis on 
the non-dual nature of ultimate reality 
have long endeared it to followers of 
Mahayana Buddhism ." 

Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes skill-in-
means in conveying the teachings of the 
Buddha. Thus, when Vimalakirti was shown
 upbraiding the Arhat disciples, it was 
for the purpose of exposing the reader 
to Mahayana principles. Otherwise how 
<pb n="734"/>
could he even meet these Arhat disciples
, let alone debate with Manjusri, the 
Bodhisattva of Wisdom? However, while 
lay people and the Buddhas may have the 
same intrinsic wisdom, they are not at 
the same level in practice. Therefore, 
the words and deeds of Vimalakirti 
should not be taken at face value but 
should be weighed carefully by anyone 
seeking to emulate them. Note in this 
regard the story of Kumarajiva (q.v.) 
and the royal gift of concubines.

 Please read entry "Practice" before the
 following excerpts from Buddhism of 
Wisdom and Faith by Master Thich Thien 
"Various realms viewed by earnest 
practitioners."

I) Internal Realms 
If we are not diligent and do not exert 
efforts along the path of cultivation, 
nothing usually happens; however, if we 
are diligent and exert a great deal of 
effort, we will definitely witness 
different realms. They either come from 
within the mind or are caused by outside
 sources. I will speak first about the 
realms originating from the mind, called
<pb n="738"/>
 internal realms. Internal realms are 
also called 'realms of the Self-Mind' 
because they do not come from outside, 
but develop from the mind. Those who do 
not clearly understand the truth that '
the thousand dharmas are created by the 
mind,' think that all realms come from 
the outside. This is wrong. When the 
practitioner reaches the stage of mutual
 interpenetration (of mind and realms), 
completely severing external conditions,
 the seeds of latent dharmas in the 
Alaya Consciousness suddenly manifest 
themselves. For the Buddha Recitation or
 mantra-chanting practitioner, the power
 of the Buddha's name or the mantra 
penetrates deep into the mind, eliciting
 a reaction from the wholesome or evil 
seeds in the Alaya consciousness. The 
realms that result are very complex and 
usually appear in dreams, or even when 
the practitioner is awake and striving 
to recite the Buddha's name. In Buddhism
, this condition is called 'changing 
manifestations of the Alaya 
consciousness.' Dreaming secrets. If the
 events or scenes result from evil seeds
, the practitioner, in his dreams, may 
see various species of worms crawling 
out of his body, or witness himself, 
<pb n="739"/>
night after night, removing from his 
body six or seven loathesome creatures 
with many limbs, such as scorpions or 
centipedes. Or else, he may see various 
species of wild animals and/or spirits 
or ghosts. Such realms are innumerable 
and cannot all be described! In general 
individuals greatly afflicted with greed
, who are miserly, and wicked, usually 
see marks of men and women, snakes and 
serpents and odd species with white 
features and forms. Those harboring a 
great deal of anger and resentment 
usually see tigers and leopards or 
strange species with red forms and 
features. Those who are heavily deluded 
usually see domestic animals, clams, 
oysters, snails or different species 
with black forms and features. The above
, however, is merely indicative; it does
 not mean that everything will be 
exactly as described. If the scenes in 
his dreams come from good, wholesome 
seeds, the practitioner sees tall trees 
and exotic flowers, beautiful scenery, 
brightly adorned with nets of pearls. Or
 else, he sees himself eating succulent,
 fragrant food, wearing ethereal 
garments, dwelling in palaces of 
diamonds and other precious substances, 
<pb n="740"/>
or flying high in open space. Thus, in 
summary, all the seeds of the ten Dharma
 Realms are found in the minds of 
sentient beings. If wholesome seeds 
manifest themselves, practitioners view 
the realms of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, 
human and celestial beings; if evil 
karma is manifested, they witness scenes
 from the wretched three Evil Paths. If 
the cultivator has followed externalist 
ways in lives past, he usually sees his 
body emitting electric waves, or his 
soul leaving the body to roam, meeting 
demons, ghosts and the like, to discuss 
politics and the rise and fall of 
countries and empires. On the other hand
, when the practitioner's mind is pure, 
he will know in his dreams about events 
that will occur three or four days, or 
seven or eight months, hence. In general
, those who have cultivated in previous 
lives will immediately see auspicious 
realms when reciting the Buddha's name. 
Those with heavy karma, lacking merit 
and virtue, will usually see evil realms
 when they begin Buddha Recitation. In 
time, these evil omens will disappear 
and gradually be replaced with 
auspicious omens. Waking scenes. If the 
practitioner's efforts have reached a 
<pb n="741"/>
high enough level, there are times 
during his waking hours when all deluded
 feelings suddenly cease for a while, 
body and mind being at ease and free. At
 other times, the practitioner may 
recite for four or five hours but feel 
that the time was very short, perhaps 
two or three minutes. Or else, at times 
during recitation, wholesome omens will 
appear. At other times, unconsciously, 
his mind experiences great contentment 
and bliss. Sometimes, he realizes for a 
split second that mind and realm are 
both empty. At other times, just by 
hearing or seeing something once, he 
becomes awakened to the truth of 
suffering, emptiness, impermanence and 
No-Self, completely severing the marks 
of self and others. These occurrences 
are too numerous to be fully described! 

(II) External Realms
They are realms which are not created by
 the mind, but come from the outside. 
For example, some practitioners might 
see Buddhas and Bodhisattvas appearing 
before them, preaching the Dharma, 
exhorting and praising them. Others, 
while reciting the Buddha's name, 
suddenly experience an awakening and 
<pb n="742"/>
immediately see the Land of Ultimate 
Bliss. Some practitioners, in the midst 
of their pure recitation, see deities 
and Immortals arrive, join hands and 
circumambulate them respectfully, or 
invite them for a leisurely stroll. 
Still other practitioners see 'wandering
 souls of the dead' arrive, seeking to '
take refuge' with them. Yet others, 
having reached a high level in their 
practice, have to endure challenges and 
harassment from external demons. For 
example, there was once a layman of 
rather dull capacities who constantly 
worshipped the Bodhisattva 
Avalokitesvara. During a dream one night
, he saw the Bodhisattva urging him to 
meditate on the following stanza, and in
 time he would experience a Great 
Awakening: 'Great wisdom develops from 
the Mind,/ Where in the Mind can it be 
found?/ To realize all meanings,/ Is to 
have neither past nor present.' Another 
story concerns a nun of the author's 
acquaintance who was cultivating in the 
vicinity of Dalat. After her Buddha 
Recitation session, as she was seated in
 meditation, she saw two men of noble 
countenance, dressed like deities or 
Immortals, respectfully inviting her to 
<pb n="743"/>
scale the mountains and visit their 
beautiful grounds. In her samadhi, she 
asked them, 'How can I go, when the 
mountains are so high and I am so weak?'
 One of the men said, 'Do not worry, I 
have a way.' He then touched her lightly
 with something similar to a willow 
branch and requested her to follow him. 
She suddenly saw her body glide 
effortlessly over the grass, and, in no 
time, she was scaling the mountains. 
There she witnessed ethereal scenes, 
with gigantic trees and a palace and 
tower in the distance. At that very 
moment, a companion in the back room 
dropped something with a bang. The nun 
suddenly awakened from meditation. All 
scenes had disappeared but her thighs 
were still aching from overexertion." 

Question/Answer
"Some might ask, 'To see Buddhas and 
lotus blossoms during Buddha Recitation 
practice -- is it not to see demonic 
apparitions?' Answer: If cause and 
effect coincide, these are not 'demonic 
realms.' This is because the Pure Land 
method belongs to the Dharma Door of 
Existence; when Pure Land practitioners 
first set out to cultivate, they enter 
<pb n="744"/>
the Way through forms and marks and seek
 to view the celestial scenes of the 
Western Pure Land. When they actually 
witness these auspicious scenes, it is 
only a matter of effects corresponding 
to causes. If cause and effect are in 
accord, how can these be 'demonic realms
'? In the Zen School, on the other hand,
 the practitioner enters the Way through
 the Dharma Door of Emptiness. Right 
from the beginning of his cultivation he
 wipes out all marks -- even the marks 
of the Buddhas or the Dharma are 
destroyed. The Zen practitioner does not
 seek to view the Buddhas or the lotus 
blossoms, yet the marks of the Buddhas 
or the lotus blossoms appear to him. 
Therefore, cause and effect do not 
correspond. For something to appear 
without a corresponding cause is indeed 
the realm of the demons. Thus, the Zen 
practitioner always holds the sword of 
wisdom aloft. If the demons come, he 
kills the demons, if the Buddha comes, 
he kills the Buddha -- to enter the 
realm of True Emptiness is not to 
tolerate a single mark."

Land.

<xa>VISUALIZATIONS，觀想</xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Contemplations</_-xa>
<_-xa>Meditation Sutra</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Sixteen Meditations</_-xa>

"The bringing to mind, calling to 
attention, or imagining in the mind (
manasikara) of an idea or visual image."
 

"Meditation. This is essentially supra-
mental, in that the mind is illuminated 
and performs its functions without the 
process of conscious thought. This is 
recognized as the highest stage of 
conscious union with Reality, by both 
Buddhist and (other) mystics." 

The scriptural basis for visualizations 
in Pure Land Buddhism can be found in 
the Meditation Sutra.
"Out of concern for future beings who 
will be without the benefit of the 
Buddha's revelation, Vaidehi (the Queen 
to whom the Buddha preached the 
Meditation Sutra) inquires about the way
 for their rebirth. In response, the 
Buddha instructs her in the sixteen 
<pb n="746"/>
kinds of contemplation, beginning with 
contemplation of the setting sun in this
 Saha World and moving on to the 
physical dimensions of Sukhavati, such 
as the ground, trees, and lakes, and to 
the features of Buddha Amitabha and the 
Bodhisattvas Avalokitesvara and 
Mahasthamaprapta. The last three 
contemplations have as their object the 
nine Grades of Rebirth (q.v.) to which 
people are assigned by virtue of their 
ability and attainment. The instructions
 on the contemplations constitute the 
primary subject of the main body of the 
sutra." (Kotatsu Fujita, The Textual 
Origin of the Kuan Wu-liang-shou Ching.)
 



<xa>VOICE</xa>
<_-xa>Name (of Buddha / Boddhisattva)</_-xa>

"The presence of a Buddha, his 
appearance and the vision that his 
audience has of him are all aspects of a
 sacred viewing, which in the Indian 
context implies a transference of power 
or grace from Buddha to sentient beings.
 Hearing the voice of the Buddha or 
<pb n="747"/>
hearing his name, seeing his physical 
body has the power to transform the 
believer, causing sincere faith, deep 
concentration of mind and even salvation
 and rebirth in a purified field." 

The purpose of seeing the Buddha is to 
be able to hear his teaching directly, 
rather than through intermediary sources
 such as sutras, commentaries, etc. 
Moreover, if cultivators are reborn in 
the Pure Land, as is said in the 
Surangama Sutra:
"They will never be far from the Buddha,
 and their Minds will awaken by 
themselves, without the aid of 
expedients. A person who has been near 
incense will carry a fragrance on his 
person ."

<pb n="748"/>

VOWS AS CRUCIAL ELEMENT
"Once Sakyamuni Buddha and his disciple 
Maudgalyayana went with a large 
gathering of followers to another 
country to convert living beings. When 
the citizens saw the Buddha they shut 
their doors and ignored him. When they 
saw Maudgalyayana, however, they ran to 
greet him, and everyone, from the King 
and ministers to the citizens, all bowed
 and competed to make offerings to him. 
The Buddha's disciples thought this most
 unfair. 'World Honored One,' they said,
 'your virtuous conduct is so lofty; why
 is it that they do not make offerings 
to you, but instead compete to make 
offerings to Maudgalyayana? "This is 
because of past affinities,' said the 
Buddha." I will tell you. Limitless 
aeons ago, Maudgalyayana and I were 
fellow-countrymen. He gathered firewood 
in the mountains and I lived in a hut 
below. A swarm of bees was bothering me 
and I decided to smoke them out. But 
Maudgalyayana refused to help even 
though they stung him until his hands 
were swollen and painful. Instead, he 
made a vow, "It must be miserable to be 
a bee," he thought. "I vow that when I 
<pb n="749"/>
attain the Way I will try to save these 
asura-like bees first thing!" Many 
lifetimes later the bees were reborn as 
the citizens of this country. The queen 
bee became the King, the drones became 
the ministers, and the workers became 
the citizens. Because I didn't like the 
bees, I now have no affinity with these 
people and therefore no one makes 
offerings to me. But because of his vow,
 all the citizens revere Maudgalyayana"'
.
In Pure Land Buddhism, there are two 
main groups of vows: 
i) The vows of Amitabha Buddha, made 
when He was the Bodhisattva Dharmakara; 
ii) The vows made by practitioners to 
achieve rebirth in Amitabha's Pure Land.

<xa>VOWS</xa>
<_-xa>One-pointedness of Mind</_-xa>; <_-xa>Original Vows</_-xa>; <_-xa>Other Power</_-xa>

Please read "Vows" before this entry.
<pb n="750"/>
(I) Vows as Crucial Element
"Making a vow to attain birth in the 
Pure Land signifies a fundamental 
reorientation of the believer's 
motivations and will. No longer is the 
purpose brute survival, or fulfillment 
of a social role, or the struggle to 
wrest some satisfaction from a 
frustrating, taxing environment. By 
vowing to be reborn in the Pure Land, 
believers shift their focus. The joys 
and sorrows of this world become 
incidental, inconsequential. The present
 life takes on value chiefly as an 
opportunity to concentrate one's 
awareness on Amitabha, and purify one's 
mind accordingly." (J.C. Cleary, tr., 
Pure Land, Pure Mind.)
"Elder Master Ou I, a high-ranking Pure 
Land monk, has said, 'To be reborn in 
the Pure Land or not depends entirely 
upon Faith and Vows; the grade of 
rebirth (high or low) depends on whether
 one's Practice is deep or shallow.' He 
further added, 'Without Faith and Vows, 
you cannot be reborn, even if you recite
 the Buddha's name to the point where 
neither the blowing wind nor the falling
 rain can penetrate and your recitation 
is as solid as a bronze wall or an iron 
<pb n="751"/>
gate.' Those who practice Buddha 
Recitation assiduously but lack Faith 
and Vows will merely obtain the merits 
and blessings of the human and celestial
 realms, according to their level of 
cultivation. When their blessings are 
exhausted they are once again subject to
 birth and death." (Thich Thien Tam, 
Buddhism of Wisdom and Faith, sec. 21.)

(II) Forms of the Rebirth Vow
Buddhism of Wisdom dc Faith/ excerpts:
"In each Buddha Recitation session, 
after the recitation itself, the 
practitioner immediately pays respect to
 Amitabha Buddha, seeking His guidance. 
He then kneels down and recites verses 
of repentance, Vows and dedication (
transference) of merit. This last part 
is very important, because it is the 
time when he concentrates his mind to 
direct merits and virtues toward the 
desired goal. This is similar to a boat 
which moves by human strength or engine 
power but whose direction is determined 
by the person at the rudder. The Vow for
 rebirth is the part of Pure Land 
cultivation in which the practitioner 
uses his mind to steer the boat of 
Buddha Recitation toward the Western 
<pb n="752"/>
Pure Land. As far as the form of the Vow
 for rebirth is concerned, some 
cultivators prefer long compositions 
through which they can develop an 
earnest mind. Others prefer a shorter 
version that includes the desire to 
achieve rebirth in the Pure Land. These 
ideas are succinctly expressed in the '
Prayer to Amita(bha) Buddha,' as follows
: 'Of Buddhas in all places and at all 
times, Amita(bha) Buddha is the foremost
. He delivers sentient beings of all 
nine grades. His glory and power are 
unlimited. We now are taking complete 
refuge in him, and repent our physical, 
oral and mental sins. If there is any 
blessing or good action, we sincerely 
apply it as parinamana (transference of 
merit). May we, as fellow Amidists, 
enjoy miraculous manifestations from 
time to time. At the end of our lives, 
the scene of the Western Paradise will 
manifest itself clearly in front of our 
eyes. What we
<_-xa>and hear will contribute to our 
good progress toward rebirth in Paradise
. We shall see the Buddha and end 
further births and deaths, just like 
Buddhas who deliver all beings. May 
boundless klesas (afflictions) be 
<pb n="753"/>
severed. May countless approaches be 
practiced. We vow that we wish to 
deliver all sentient beings and that all
 may achieve Buddhahood. Even if the 
Void is finite, our wish, however, is 
infinite...'(The Buddhist Liturgy, p. 
271-273)</_-xa>

"If the cultivator is of limited 
capacity or failing memory and is unable
 to recall long involved sentences, he 
should simply memorize the following 
short form of the Vow for rebirth in the
 Pure Land: On .... (date), this 
disciple, (name) ... vows that through 
the virtues just accumulated, he will, 
at the time of death, be welcomed and 
guided by Amitabha Buddha to the Land of
 Ultimate Bliss, so that he may achieve 
Buddhahood and save sentient beings. 
This short Vow, accompanied by its exact
 date, has the effect of strongly 
focussing the practitioner's mind at all
 times on the Pure Land and on rebirth 
there. This small detail is an expedient
 that renders the Vow that much more 
powerful and firm." 

(III) Note According to the Buddha, as 
sentient beings, we all have strong 
<pb n="754"/>
attachments -- particularly to our 
bodies and possessions. At the time of 
death, as we are about to lose both body
 and possessions, our consciousness, 
impelled by these deep-seated 
attachments, rushes to reincarnate 
itself in another body. It is at this 
juncture that vows, particularly the vow
 for rebirth in the Pure Land, are 
crucial: instead of just following our 
karma, good and evil, we may, through 
the power of these vows, achieve rebirth
 in the Pure Land. 

"When making the Vow for rebirth in the 
Pure Land, we should do so from the 
depth of our earnest mind. If we merely 
recite pro forma at our convenience, 
without earnestness, our practice of 
Buddha Recitation will not be true and 
sincere. Elder Master Yin Kuang has said
: Deep sincerity is a major element that
 leads to one pointedness of mind. One 
part of deep sincerity destroys one part
 of bad karma and yields one part of 
merit and wisdom. Ten parts of deep 
sincerity destroy ten parts of bad karma
 and yield ten parts of merit and wisdom
. The ancients have also said: The power
 of deep sincerity focussed in any 
<pb n="755"/>
direction can explode mountains and melt
 gold in that direction."

<_-xa>Ten Great Vows</_-xa>
Syn: <_-xa>Mount Gridhrakuta</_-xa>; <_-xa>
Eagle Peak</_-xa>
<_-xa>Rajagrha</_-xa>

"A mountain located to the northeast of 
Rajagriha, the capital of Magadha in 
ancient India, where Shakyamuni is said 
to have expounded the Lotus Sutra and 
other teachings. Vulture Peak (Eagle 
Peak) was so called because its summit 
is shaped like an eagle and because it 
was inhabited by many eagles. The 
expression Eagle Peak is also used to 
symbolize the Buddha-land or the state 
of Buddhahood " 

"For strategic reasons Rajagaha the 
capital of the old kingdom of Magadha, 
was built amidst mountains and 
consequently in the summer was stifling 
hot and in the monsoon period humid and 
stuffy. The Buddha, therefore, liked to 
<pb n="756"/>
spend his time on Vulture Peak. Here he 
preached dozens of sermons. The platform
 found on top of the (peak) is of later 
origin. From Vulture Peak the eye 
wanders back to the now inhabited valley
 of Rajagaha. The modern town of Rajgir 
lies outside the valley. The ascent to 
Vulture Peak begins at the remains of 
the monastery which Jivaka, the 
physician to King Bimbisara, presented 
to the Buddha as a gift. Further up on 
the path, perhaps on the road section, 
one passes the place where Devadatta 
tried in vain to kill the master by 
hurling down a boulder. After the death 
of the Buddha (483 B.C.) the first 
Council took place in a cave in one of 
the mountains around Rajagaha."

"Grdhrakuta mountain (Vulture Peak) was 
much associated with the life of the 
Buddha. Grdhrakuta is on the Chhahata 
hill at Rajagrha (modern Rajgir in the 
Patna district of Bihar). It was one of 
the favorite resorts of the Buddha and 
is one of the five sacred hills 
surrounding the city of Rajagrha, the 
capital of the powerful state of Magadha
. From the foot of the Grdhrakuta to the
 top there is a road supposed to have 
<pb n="757"/>
been constructed by King Bimbisara in 
order to reach the Buddha and listen to 
his preachings. It was here that 
Devadatta, a cousin of the Buddha, made 
an attempt on his life by hurling a rock
 at him. The hill has many natural caves
 where the Buddha lived... according to 
the Record of Hsuan-Tsang."

diplomacy is more effective than war. No
 matter how difficult our situation, we

than kill him or her. If there is a war,
<pb n="758"/>
 we can consider carefully what choice 
to make. We can weigh the advantages and
 disadvantages of killing in this and in
 future lives, and the effects of this 
action on ourselves and others. Then we 
can decide according to what we consider
 best(or least harmful!), although there
 may be no easy solution." 
"Question: Is self-defense ever 
justifiable in the light of the Buddhist
 emphasis on nonviolence? 
Answer: Self-defense needn't involve 
violence, and nonviolence doesn't mean 
becoming a doormat. We can seek ways to 
protect ourselves from harm without 
harming others or by inflicting the 
least amount of harm necessary. When 
however much time is available, we can 
try to diminish our self-centredness and
 reflect on compassion before acting... 
If we feel we cannot avoid maiming or 
killing, we can at least try to do it...
 with regret at having to cause another 
pain. If our intention to cause harm is 
weak, the karmic effect of the act will 
be less."

"A Western interest in Buddhism began 
during the l9th century as a result of 
colonial contacts with Buddhist 
countries and the start of academic 
studies of the Buddhist tradition ... 
The visits to the West by Buddhists such
 as Anagarika Dharmapala, who spoke at 
the World Parliament of Religions in 
Chicago in 1893, quickened interest. A 
small Buddhist movement began in the USA
 and Europe at the beginning of the 20th
 century, tending to stress the 
nontheistic, practical and logical 
nature of Buddhism in its Theravada 
rather than Mahayana aspects. After 
World War II, Zen Buddhism came into 
vogue due to the work of Daisetz Teitaro
 Suzuki and Zen practitioners who set up
 Zen groups in the USA.
<pb n="764"/>
Tibetan Buddhism arrived in the West 
after the flight of the Dalai Lama from 
Tibet, and Tibetan Buddhist centres 
which attracted Western followers were 
set up around the West ... In the last 
20 years many more groups have been 
formed which tend to attract thinking 
Westerners and to have some sort of 
allegiance to Theravada, Zen or Tibetan 
Buddhism. More Westerners tend to be 
attracted to the Buddhist than to the 
Hindu or Muslim traditions, and although
 their numbers are still small their 
significance is growing." 
NOTE:
"In the May-July 1994 issue of Gold Drum

 of the 'Idols of the Marketplace', 
three modern views that, especially in 
the USA, are being increasingly confused
 with Buddhism: 'democratisation', '
feminization', and 'integration'. 
Democratization, however appropriate in 
society at large, undermines the notion 
of spiritual hierarchy, (while) the 
integration of spiritual life into 
ordinary worldly life overlooks the 
necessity for renunciation.

<xa>WHITE</xa>
<_-xa>Lu-shan</_-xa>; <_-xa>Hui-yuang</_-xa>
; <_-xa>Ming dynasty</_-xa>; <_-xa>Pure 
Land school</_-xa>

The White Lotus Society (5th century) 
and the White Lotus Secret Societies (
l2th century) have almost the same name 
and ostensibly the same goal --
edification of members and rebirth in 
the Pure Land. However, the White Lotus 
Society had a purely religious goal and 
therefore was not opposed by orthodox 
Buddhists and Confucianists. The White 
Lotus Secret Societies, by contrast, had
 political goals and were banned by the 
Chinese government.

Background
I. "'White Lotus Society,' (Pai-lien She
/ Bach-Lien-Xa - 5th c.) was a group of 
one hundred and thirty-eight devotees 
who in the 5th century made a collective
 vow on Mount Lu to be reborn together 
in Sukhavati under Master Hui-yuan's 
<pb n="767"/>
leadership, which thereby effected Hui-
yuan's fame as a Pure Land devotee." 
II. 'The White Lotus Secret Societies/ 
White Lotus Sect (Pai-Lien P'ai/ Bach 
Lien Phai12th c.) were started during 
the early years of the Southern Sung 
Dynasty by an individual named Mao Tzu-
yuan, a native of Kiangsu, who had been 
a disciple of Ching-fan (d 1128), a T'
ien-t'ai master also interested in the 
Pure Land doctrine... Inspired by the 
example of Master Hui-yuan in Lushan, he
 organized a White Lotus Secret Society 
consisting of monks and laymen devoted 
to the restraint of the passions and the
 encouragement of good karma.
The group met regularly to utter 
invocations and sing praises to the 
Buddha and to hear confessions from the 
members... The fact that men and women 
mixed freely at the meetings of the 
Societies, (wore white robes and 
ostensibly practiced magic), aroused the
 opposition of orthodox Buddhists as 
well as Confucianists, and the Society 
was criticized as being a hotbed of 
debauchery... As a result of these 
charges, Mao was banished to Chiang-chou
 (present-day Kiukiang in Kiangsi) and 
the Society was banned. In spite of this
<pb n="768"/>
 prohibition, however, the Society 
continued to exist and even to expand. 
Under the Mongol Dynasty the ban was 
reaffirmed... " Chen/64: 429-430 The 
White Lotus Society (5th c.) headed by 
Master Hui-yuan should be clearly 
distinguished from later secret 
societies of similar name during the 
l2th century, as the latter had 
political overtones. Opposed to the 
Mongol emperors who ruled China, the 
secret societies galvanized the masses 
and ultimately succeeded in deposing the
 Yuan (Mongol dynasty) and establishing 
the Ming dynasty.

"Fundamental wisdom which is inherent in
 every man and which can manifest itself
 only after the veil of ignorance, which
 screens it, has been transformed by 
means of self-cultivation as taught by 
the Buddha. Then the mind is in an 
internal state of imperturbability, 
exempt from all external sensation, 
which is called samadhi." 
Samadhi and wisdom should always coexist
 and form a whole. Wisdom not 
accompanied by Samadhi is termed "Dried-
Up Wisdom" (Dry Wisdom). Samadhi not 
accompanied by wisdom is called "Dead 
Tree Samadhi". 
Dry wisdom: "Intellectual understanding 
without mental stabilization; also 
refers to contemplation of phenomena 
without realization of noumenon."

"A generic term for those sutras which 
deal with the teaching of Prajna-
paramita or the perfection of wisdom, 
and expound the concept of non-
substantiality (Jpn/ ku). Sometimes the 
term in the singular is used in 
reference to the 600-fascicle Wisdom 
Sutra translated by Hsuan-tsang." 
"(As translated by Hsuan-tsang, the 
Wisdom Sutras consist of) a long sermon,
 composed of several sutras, expounded 
by the Buddha in four places at sixteen 
assemblies; it consists of six hundred 
rolls (chuan) bound in one hundred and 
twenty volumes, and is the fundamental 
work of the Mahayana on wisdom, which is
 the last of the Six Paramitas." 
"A corpus of 16 Prajna sutras with 
anonymous authorship is known as the 
Mahaprajnaparwnita Sutra, a group of 
texts greatly esteemed by the Chinese. 
<pb n="771"/>
All the sutras belonging to the Prajna 
school were translated into Chinese 
several times, both in a complete form 
and in extracts. The first one to be 
translated was the Mahaprajnaparamita in
 600 fasciculi equivalent to 200,000 
slokas (karikas). Lokaksema, an 
IndoScythian monk was credited with 
introducing Mahayana Buddhism in China. 
His partial translation of the 
Astasahasrika Prajna-Paramita, based on 
a manuscript from India started a new 
epoch in the history of Buddhism in 
China. Then followed various 
translations of shorter versions like 
the Heart Sutra (Prajna Paramita Hrdaya 
Sutra) and the Diamond Sutra (
Vajracchedika Sutra)... " 
NOTE: 
This collection forms the longest sutra 
in the Mahayana canon (followed by the 
Avatamsaka Sutra). The two best known 
sutras within it are the Diamond Sutra 
and the Heart Sutra, the latter being 
the shortest and representing the 
epitome of the Wisdom philosophy.

"To be born into a woman's body was 
considered a cause for special suffering
 on account of menstruation, childbirth 
and menopause ..." (Susan Murcott The 
First Buddhist Women) 

"On one occasion while the Buddha was 
conversing with King Kosala of India, a 
messenger came and informed the King 
that a daughter was born unto him. 
Hearing it, the King was displeased. But
 the Buddha comforted and stimulated him
<pb n="774"/>
, saying: 'A woman child, O Lord of men,
 may prove even a better offspring than 
male.' To women who were placed under 
various disabilities before the 
appearance of the Buddha, the 
establishment of the order of Bhikkhunis
 was certainly a blessing. In this order
 queens, princesses, daughters of noble 
families, widows, bereaved mothers, 
helpless women, courtesans -- all, 
despite their caste or rank -- met on a 
common footing, enjoyed perfect 
consolation and peace, and breathed that
 free atmosphere which was denied to 
those cloistered in cottages and 
palatial mansions. Many, who otherwise 
would have fallen into oblivion, 
distinguished themselves in various ways
 and gained their emancipation by 
seeking refuge in the order." 

"Buddhism has always aimed at the ideal 
relationship between men and women. 
Women played an important part in the 
spread of early Buddhism, both as lay 
disciples and Bhikkhuni. Famous women in
 early Buddhism were: Bhadda, famous for
 her discourses and for her memories of 
former lives; Visakha, a wealthy 
patroness of the order; Ambapali, a 
<pb n="775"/>
courtesan who became a convert and 
supported the Sangha; Dhammadipa, the 
great preacher; Mahaprajapati, the 
Buddha's foster-mother, who founded the 
Sangha for women; Khema, the consort of 
king Bimbisara, renowned for her 
profound insight and Yashodhara, the 
wife of Gotama, also entered the Sangha.
 In later times, we have Sanghamitta, 
the daughter of Asoka, who founded the 
Sangha in Sri Lanka." 

"In Hindu tradition, the main duties 
assigned to women were childbearing and 
housework. Consequently, a single life 
was seen as a wasted life and unmarried 
women were subject to scoffs. On the 
contrary, in Buddhism, married life was 
viewed as a hindrance to spiritual 
pursuits. Wherever the Buddhist point of
 view prevailed, a woman was no longer 
compelled to marry to achieve self 
respect and approval from her family. 
From the founding of this order, it has 
provided an even better option for women
 who were spiritually and religiously 
inclined. Sumana, the youngest daughter 
of Anathapindika did not marry but 
joined the order at an advanced age. 
There are other instances recorded in 
<pb n="776"/>
the Therigatha." 
NOTE:
"When investigating feminine imagery in 
Buddhist literature, it is important to 
keep in mind the social and cultural 
setting within which the teachings were 
given. The original texts themselves 
present a range of variant images, not 
contradictory in an absolute sense, but 
speaking to different audiences and to 
beings of different propensities. One 
point to be noted, for example, is that 
many of the discourses in these early 
texts were aimed at helping celibate 
males break through attachments to the 
female form. Had the Buddha been 
addressing celibate females, the defects
 of the male form would have been 
similarly elaborated." (Karma Lekshe 
Tsomo, Daughters of the Buddha )

<xa>WORDLESS</xa>
<pb n="777"/>
<_-xa>Avatamsaka Sutra華嚴經</_-xa>

Term found in the Avatamsaka Sutra, Ch. 
37:
"It is as if there were a great 
scripture,/ Equal in extent to a 
universe,/ Existing inside one atom,/ 
And in all atoms as well;/ Someone with 
intelligence and wisdom,/ Sees all 
clearly with pure eyes,/ And breaks the 
atoms, releasing the scriptures,/ For 
the benefit of all beings./ Buddha-
knowledge, likewise,/ Is in all beings' 
minds..."

"The 'great scripture' stands for the 
wisdom of the Buddhas, measureless and 
all-pervasive. 'Atoms,' or motes of dust
 represent sentient beings, all of us. 
The image has 3 meanings:1) the false 
hides the true, 2) the minute 
encompasses the immense, 3) one is all. 
The scripture is 'equal in extent to a 
universe' because the Buddha's wisdom is
 consonant with the essence of all 
dharmas. The scripture 'exists in all 
atoms' because all sentient beings 
possess in full the wisdom, the mind of 
the Buddhas. 
'This big sutra is wordless, but it also
<pb n="778"/>
 has boundlessly many words. It's just 
that we do not understand them and we 
don't know how to read them. Each person
 is in fact a sutra...The true wordless 
sutra is just the mind-sutra. What is 
the mind-sutra? It is the embodiment of 
the tenet that everything is made from 
mind alone..."'

Buddhism of Wisdom ＆ Faith/ excerpts:
"A king once asked the twenty-seventh 
Indian Patriarch of Zen, 'Other 
cultivators all recite the sutras: why 
is it that you do not?' The Patriarch 
replied, 'This humble monk, when 
exhaling, is not in contact with mundane
 conditions, and when inhaling, does not
 dwell in the "conditioned world" of the
 Five Skandas. He has recited that sutra
 over and over millions of times.' The 
Patriarch meant that he habitually 
recited the 'Wordless Sutra of the Mind.
' This sutra means, externally, not 
relying on or clinging to the multitude 
of conditions and, internally, remaining
 silent and still, unperturbed by the 
Five Skandas (Aggregates) and the 
Eighteen Elements. Even all marks, 
internal, external and in between, are 
eliminated forever. This is the meaning 
<pb n="779"/>
of 'mind cultivation.' Nevertheless, we 
should not be so attached to the above 
that we reject vegetarianism, charity, 
repentance, Buddha and sutra recitation.
 This is because all of these practices,
 from the standpoint of wisdom, help the
 practitioner swiftly eliminate karmic 
obstacles and become enlightened to his 
Self-Nature; from the standpoint of 
blessings and merit, they enable him to 
attain favorable karma and rebirth in 
auspicious lands or the Western Pure 
Land, where he may pursue his practice 
without retrogression. Only when he has 
perfected both merit and wisdom can he 
achieve Buddhahood. For this reason, the
 great Bodhisattvas, completely 
enlightened as they are to the source of
 the mind, still practice the ten 
thousand merits to adorn the pure lands.
 For example, even though the 
Bodhisattva Maitreya is in his last 
rebirth before Buddhahood, he still 
practices repentance continually to rid 
himself of subtle obstacles and swiftly 
achieve Supreme Enlightenment. We should
 realize that the teaching in the Sutra 
in Forty-Two Sections and the words of 
the twenty-seventh Zen Patriarch are 
deliberately one-sided in character, 
<pb n="780"/>
partial examples designed to eliminate 
attachment to form -- that is, 
cultivation bereft of the mind. In 
summary, in addition to reciting the 
Buddha's name, mantras and sutras and 
conducting repentance ceremonies, the 
Pure Land cultivator should also devote 
attention to 'opening up the mind.' For 
the mind to be awakened so that Buddha 
Recitation can lead to swift rebirth in 
the Pure Land, he must rid himself of 
afflictions. Going deeper, while 
uttering the Buddha's name is 'form,' it
 is also 'essence,' because noumenon 
does not exist outside of phenomena -- 
to recite is Buddha, to recite is Mind. 
That is why merit and wisdom are fully 
encompassed in the sacred words '
Amitabha Buddha', perfectly fusing 
noumenon and phenomena, and swiftly 
leading the practitioner both to the 
state of Perfectly Enlightened Wondrous 
Mind and to the pure karma of rebirth in
 the realm of Amitabha Buddha."

<xa>WORLD-ORIGIN，世界起源</xa>
<_-xa>Cosmology</_-xa>; <_-xa>World system</_-xa>; <_-xa>Universe</_-xa>

"There are three schools of thought 
regarding the origin of the world. The 
first claims that this world came into 
existence by nature and that nature is 
not an intelligent force. However, 
nature works on its own accord and goes 
on changing. The second school of 
thought says that the world was created 
by an almighty God who is responsible 
for everything. The third says that the 
beginning of this world and of life is 
inconceivable since they have neither 
beginning nor end. Buddhism is in 
accordance with this third school of 
thought. Bertrand Russell supported this
 school of thought by saying, 'There is 
no reason to suppose that the world had 
a beginning at all. The idea that things
 must have a beginning is really due to 
the poverty of our thoughts.' Modern 
science says that some millions of years
 ago, the newly cooled earth was 
lifeless and that life originated in the
 ocean. Buddhism has never claimed that 
the world, sun, moon, stars, winds, 
water, days and nights were created by a
<pb n="788"/>
 powerful god or by a Buddha. Buddhists 
believe that the world was not created 
once upon a time, but that the world is 
being created millions of times every 
second and will continue to do so by 
itself and will destroy itself. 
According to Buddhism, world systems 
always appear and disappear in the 
universe... The Buddha did not waste His
 time on this issue. The reason for His 
silence was that this issue has no 
religious value for gaining spiritual 
wisdom. The explanation of the origin of
 the universe is not the concern of 
religion. Such theorizing is not 
necessary for living a righteous way of 
life and for shaping our future life. 
However, if one insists on studying this
 subject, then one must investigate the 
sciences of astronomy, geology, biology 
and anthropology. These sciences can 
offer more reliable and tested 
information on this subject than can be 
supplied by any religion. The purpose of
 a religion is to cultivate the life 
here in this world and hereafter until 
liberation is gained. In the eyes of the
 Buddha, the world is nothing but 
Samsara - the cycle of repeated births 
and deaths. To Him, the beginning of the
<pb n="789"/>
 world and the end of the world are 
within this Samsara. Since elements and 
energies are relative and inter-
dependent, it is meaningless to single 
out anything as the beginning. Whatever 
speculation we make regarding the origin
 of the world, there is no absolute 
truth in our notion. One day a man 
called Malunkyaputta approached the 
Master and demanded that He explain the 
origin of the Universe to him. He even 
threatened to cease to be His follower 
if the Buddha's answer was not 
satisfactory. The Buddha calmly retorted
 that it was of no consequence to Him 
whether or not Malunkyaputta followed 
Him, because the Truth did not need 
anyone's support. Then the Buddha said 
that He would not go into a discussion 
of the origin of the Universe. To Him, 
gaining knowledge about such matters was
 a waste of time because a man's task 
was to liberate himself from the present
, not the past or the future. To 
illustrate this, the Enlightened One 
related the parable of a man who was 
shot by a poisoned arrow. This foolish 
man refused to have the arrow removed 
until he found out all about the person 
who shot the arrow. By the time his 
<pb n="790"/>
attendants discovered these unnecessary 
details, the man was dead. Similarly, 
our immediate task is to attain Nirvana,
 i.e., escape Birth and Death, not to 
worry about our beginnings."

Thirteenth patriarch of the Pure Land 
School. The life of the Pure Land 
Patriarch Yin Kuang covers a most 
eventful period for East Asia and 
parallels the Sino-Japanese War, the 
Chinese Revolution of 1911 and two World
 Wars. "The revolution of 1911 that 
toppled the Manchu dynasty and 
established the Republic of China also 
brought in its wake a number of problems
 for the Buddhist sangha (clergy). 
Following the political revolution, an 
intellectual climate was ushered in that
 was unfriendly to the interests of 
<pb n="798"/>
Buddhism ... The attack and criticism 
against Buddhism resulted in a number of
 discriminatory measures, such as 
special taxes and contributions being 
levied on temples, monasteries being 
appropriated for use as barracks and 
police stations, and Buddhist images 
being destroyed ... (Against this 
backdrop, two eminent monks rose to lead
 the resurgence of Buddhism: Master T'ai
 Hsu, who was instrumental in the 
revival of the Mind- Only school and 
Master Yin Kuang, later to become the 
Thirteenth Patriarch of Pure Land.) The 
monk mainly responsible for instilling 
new life and meaning into (the practice 
of Buddha Recitation and the chanting of
 sutras was Master) Yin Kuang who, after
 his conversion to Pure Land pietism, 
concentrated on living a pure religious 
life based on faith, devotion and 
holiness ... Master Yin Kuang carried on
 his teachings mainly in the provinces 
of Kiangsu and Chekiang, where he gained
 numerous followers and disciples ... 
These efforts by Master Yin Kuang and 
his followers brought about an extensive
 revival of the Pure Land school. Lotus 
Societies, Nien-fo (Buddha Recitation) 
Societies, and others of a similar 
<pb n="799"/>
nature sprang up all over China." (
Kenneth Ch'en, Buddhism in China, p. 
455ff.)" 

"From as early as the Tang period we 
hear of the existence of 'Pure Land 
Cloisters' within larger monastic 
complexes, where a congregation of self-
professed Pure Land mendicants could 
pursue a collective regimen of Pure Land
 practice and study. Over the centuries 
that followed, influential Pure Land 
masters have periodically sought to 
organize individual monasteries along 
Pure Land lines ... The Ming dynasty 
master Chu Hung (1535-1615) and 
Republican period master Yin Kuang (1861
-1940) represent two such figures who 
have had a profound impact on the 
monastic form of Pure Land Buddhism in 
modern times. Both instituted 
comprehensive plans for adapting 
traditional monastic structures and 
routines to the specific purposes of 
Pure Land devotion, including the 
creation of halls for the concentrated 
recitation of the Buddha's name that 
were modeled on the traditional Chan 
meditation hall. At the same time, monks
 and nuns of the Pure Land school have 
<pb n="800"/>
developed a number of distinctive forms 
of retreat that are organized along the 
lines of the seven-day rite of buddha-
mindfulness (see Seven Day Retreat) but 
apply its program to a more intensive 
monastic setting."

<xa>YOGA，瑜伽</xa>
<_-xa>Zen School</_-xa>

"A form of meditation developed in 
ancient India aimed at liberating one 
from the physical limitations of the 
body, or more broadly, from sufferings, 
by achieving concentration of mind and 
fusing with the truth. There are several
 schools of yoga which employ a variety 
of disciplines, including breath control
<pb n="801"/>
, special postures, among others. Today 
some of the physical yogic disciplines 
are widely practiced for health and 
tranquillity of mind, without any 
particular religious motivation." 

In contrast to yoga, Buddhist meditation
 (in Zen, Pure Land, etc.), in its ideal
 form, centers on the full development 
of the Bodhi Mind, the aspiration to 
achieve Enlightenment for the benefit of
 all sentient beings. For details, see 
Hinduism / Buddhism.

"One of the two major Mahayana schools 
in India, along with the Madhyamika 
school. Maitreya Boddhisattva is often 
regarded as the founder of the Yogacara 
(Consciousness-Only) school. He 
reportedly inspired a one-hundred-
fascicle treatise which explained the 
<pb n="802"/>
Consciousness-Only doctrine. Thereafter,
 the Consciousness-Only doctrine was 
further developed by Maitreya's 
disciples Asanga and Vasubandhu in the 
first half of the fifth century. This 
school upholds the concept that all 
phenomena arise from the vijnana or 
consciousness and that the basis of all 
functions of consciousness is the alaya-
vijnana or alaya-consciousness. It is 
said that the Consciousness-Only 
doctrine constituted the mainstream of 
Buddhist study in the Nalanda Monastery.
" 

"The name of a Buddhist school founded 
probably in the fourth century by the

advocates the doctrine of Mind Only (all

Best known proponent of the 
harmonization of Zen and Pure Land 
doctrines. Most famous for his verses on
 Zen and Pure Land practice, entitled 
Four Options (q.v.). 

"Famous Ch'an master, Dharma successor 
of state-master Teh Shao. He wrote the 
extensive collection The Sect's Mirror (
Tsung Ching Lu) in which he linked all 
the seemingly contradictory Buddhist 
doctrines to one reality. Died in 975 at
 the age of 72." 

<pb n="805"/>
"Ch'an Master Yung-ming's syncretism 
went so far as to advocate the religious
 practice of the nembutsu (Buddha 
Recitation) or invocation of the name of
 Amitabha Buddha. This was by no means a
 complete innovation, since three 
disciples of the Fifth Patriarch of Ch'
an -Fa-chih (635-702) and his disciple 
Chih-wei (646-722), the fourth and fifth
 patriarchs of the Ox-head school, as 
well as Chih-shen (609-702) - had 
already practiced the nembutsu in 
addition to Zen meditation... During the
 Sung period, sometimes with the support
 of the masters and sometimes against 
their opposition, the nembutsu made 
greater and greater inroads into Zen 
monasteries. This process of mixing 
religious practices continued through 
the Yuan period and came to term during 
the Ming dynasty. The simultaneous 
practice of Zen and the nembutsu became 
a matter of common practice. In trying 
to judge this whole development, we must
 not forget the inner affinities of the 
two practices. The psychological effects
 of the meditative repetition of the 
holy name are close to the effects of 
Zen meditation..." (H. Dumoulin, Zen 
Buddhism: Vol. I, p. 286.). From Elder 
<pb n="806"/>
Master Yung-ming's fascicle in 
Transmission of The Lamp we learned that
 the Master recited the Lotus Sutra many
 thousand times. He sought enlightenment
 mainly by nien-fo, or reciting the 
Buddha's name, a practice of the Pure 
Land School. Yung-ming said, "Those who 
devote themselves to Ch'an and neglect 
the Pure Land will fail, nine out of ten
, to attain enlightenment; but those who
 devote themselves to the practice of 
Pure Land will, without exception, have 
their awakening. Those who practice Ch'
an and Pure Land at the same time will 
be at their best; they will be like 
tigers wearing horns." (Chang Chung-Yuan
: Original Teaching of Ch'an Buddhism). 
NOTE: "Zen master Yung-Ming (q.v.) 
introduced a development that truly bore
 fruit only later ... He may be 
considered a pioneer of the unification 
movement between Zen and the Pure Land 
tradition, a movement that later on was 
to gain the upper hand in East Asian 
Buddhism."

"The word 'Zen' comes from the Sanskrit 
dhyana (meditation). The word 'dhyana' 
was transcribed as Ch'an in Chinese,
and the latter was transcribed as Zen in
 Japanese."

In the west, the word Ch'an is far 
better known by its Japanese name Zen. 
Hence, in this glossary, the word zen is
 generally used in lieu of Ch'an. 

"It is said that one day Brahma lord of 
creation, offered the Buddha a flower 
and asked him to preach the Dharma. When
 the Buddha held up the flower, his 
audience was puzzled, except for 
Kashyapa, who smiled. This is how Zen 
began. And this is how it was 
transmitted: with a flower, with a rock 
wall, with a shout." (Red Pine, The Zen 
<pb n="809"/>
Teaching of Bodhidharma" p. xvi.)

I. Generalities
"A school of Mahayana Buddhism in China 
founded by Bodhidharma (6th century). 
This school stresses the cultivation of 
intuitive wisdom. An extremely 
influential Buddhist school in East Asia
." 

"A school which maintains that 
enlightenment is not to be found in the 
pursuit of doctrinal studies but only 
through the direct perception of one's 
own mind with the practice of meditation
. Bodhidharma (sixth century) is 
regarded as the founder. The Treatise on
 the Perception of the True Nature of 
the Mind, said to be the work of 
Bodhidharma but probably written by 
later disciples, describes Zen in these 
words: 'A special transmission outside 
the sutras,/ Independent of word and 
writ,/ Pointing directly to the mind of 
man,/ Seeing one's true nature and 
attaining Buddhahood.' According to this
 school, supreme enlightenment is 
wordlessly transmitted from mind to mind
, and Shakyamuni Buddha is said to have 
transferred his true enlightenment in 
<pb n="810"/>
this way to his disciple Mahakashyapa. 
The lineage then passed to the second 
patriarch Ananda and then finally to the
 twenty-eighth Indian patriarch 
Bodhidharma, who brought the 'wordless 
tradition' to China where it became 
known as Ch'an Buddhism, (now far better
 known by its Japanese name, Zen). 
Thereafter, the teaching of Zen was 
transmitted to the second Chinese 
patriarch Hui-k'o, the third, Seng-ts'an
, the fourth, Tao-hsin, the fifth, Hung-
jen, and the sixth patriarch, Hui-neng (
638-713). In the days of Hui-neng, the 
sect divided into the Southern school of
 Zen, led by Hui-neng, and the Northern 
school, headed by Shen-hsiu. The 
Northern school rapidly declined, but 
the Southern school produced excellent 
disciples and became the Ch'an. (This 
southern school eventually subdivided 
itself into seven schools, of which the 
better known are the Rinzai (Lin-chi) 
and Soto (Ts'ao-tung).J ... 
In Japan, Zen was established in the 
early days of the Kamakura period when 
Eisai went to Sung China and brought 
back the teachings of the Lin-chi school
. Subsequently Dogen also went to Sung 
China and brought back the Ts'ao-tung 
<pb n="811"/>
school's teachings. During the Kamakura 
and the Muromachi periods (1336-1573), 
Zen teachings became connected with 
bushido or the way of the samurai and 
greatly prospered. In 1654, Ingen (Chin 
Yin-yuan) came from Ming China to Japan 
and later founded the Obaku Zen School (
q.v.), (which combines Zen and Pure Land
 practices)." 

"The critic will be inclined to call Zen
 absurd, confusing, and beyond the ken 
of ordinary reasoning. But Zen is 
inflexible and would protest that the so
-called common sense way of looking at 
things is not final, and that the reason
 why we cannot
attain to a thoroughgoing comprehension 
of the truth is due to our unreasonable 
adherence to a 'logical' interpretation 
of things. If we really want to get to 
the bottom of life, we must abandon our 
cherished syllogisms, we must acquire a 
new way of observation whereby we can 
escape the tyranny of logic and the 
onesidedness of our everyday phraseology
 ... This is because Zen has come to the
 definite conclusion that the ordinary 
logical process of reasoning is 
powerless to give final satisfaction to 
<pb n="812"/>
our deepest spiritual needs."

"It is sometimes suggested that Ch'an 
represents a radically new development, 
even one which is no longer Buddhist at 
all. This is an exaggeration. In fact 
there is almost nothing in Ch'an which 
cannot be paralleled in earlier Indian 
Buddhism. The difference is in style 
rather than content. Ch'an adopted 
unconventional and unusual forms of 
expression. Probably the example of 
Taoism is very important here, 
especially for its tradition of 
simplicity and naturalness." 

"Concerning Zen Buddhism, no one can 
deny its great contribution in bringing 
thousands to direct realization. Zen is 
emptiness in action, the living 
prajnaparamita. It is hard to find words
 to praise Zen adequately. The more one 
studies and practices Dharma, the more 
one appreciates and admires Zen. However
, without proper guidance and sufficient
 preparation, Zen can also be dangerous 
and futile. By misconstruing a pseudo-
experience as true enlightenment, one 
may develop an unwarranted self-conceit.
 Zen can also induce a devil-may-care 
<pb n="813"/>
attitude and one may eventually lose all
 ground in one's Dharmic efforts." (G.CC
. Chang, tr., A Treasury of Mahayana 
Sutras) 

Most ancient masters, including such 
figures as the Patriarch Dogen, the 
founder of the Japanese school of Soto 
Zen, held that only monks and nuns could
 achieve Enlightenment through Zen. 

II. Main Practice
Seated meditation and Koan Study
"The practice of sitting in meditation 
was carried out widely in ancient India 
and was incorporated into Buddhism by 
Shakyamuni himself, who sat in 
meditation when he attained his 
enlightenment under the Bodhi tree. This
 practice was introduced into China, 
where T'ien-t'ai taught it as part of an
 integrated system of disciplines to 
perceive the true nature of one's mind. 
The Ch'an (Jpn./ Zen) school attaches 
great importance to the practice of 
seated meditation." 

"(The Lin chi/Rinzai school stresses) 
sudden enlightenment and the use of 
koans (paradoxical questions for jerking
<pb n="814"/>
 the mind out of its normal patterns 
into a sudden awareness of the truth). 
The Ts'ao Tung/Soto school stresses 
gradual enlightenment and a combination 
of methods including koans, by relying 
mainly on the silent illumination of 
seated meditation (zazen), ending in the
 realization of the individual's oneness
 with reality." 

"One of the greatest advantages of the 
half, or full-lotus sitting posture is 
that when the hands and feet are brought
 together in one point with the hands 
resting on the heels of the feet, pulse,
 blood pressure, metabolism, and other 
vital functions are at their quietest. 
It should be noted, however, that though
 these physiological functions are 
greatly quieted, the Zen meditator does 
not sink into a trance state, 
unresponsive to the world around him. 
Rather, electroencephalographic studies 
have shown that one doing concentrated 
Zen meditation responds immediately to 
external stimuli and, in fact, responds 
each time the same stimulus is repeated,
 whereas most people lose awareness of 
such repeated stimuli. Moreover, while 
the response appears each time on the 
<pb n="815"/>
EEG of one doing zazen, it also very 
quickly disappears. It can be said, then
, that the person seriously practicing 
Zen meditation is fully aware of what is
 happening in the world around him yet 
does not cling to this awareness. These 
EEG results with Zen meditators contrast
 sharply with those found among people 
involved in other disciplines. In Yoga 
meditation, for example, it was shown 
that the practitioner is, in a sense, 
tuned out from the world around him, and
 does not respond at all to external 
stimuli.

NOTE: Zen/Pure Land
"Zen Master Yung-Ming (q.v.) introduced 
a development that truly bore fruit only
 later ... He may be considered a 
pioneer of the unification movement 
between Zen and the Buddha Recitation 
tradition, a movement that later on was 
to gain the upper hand in East Asian 
Buddhism."

Please read entries "Pure Land Buddhism 
(Summary)' and "Zen' before the 
following. 
In the west, Pure Land and Zen, two of 
the most popular schools of Buddhism are
 sometimes viewed as different forms of 
practice, designed for different 
categories of believers. This is not 
however the teaching of Patriarchs and 
Masters in East Asia where Zen and Pure 
Land are considered complementary -like 
the two wings of a bird.

(I) Wisdom and Compassion
"The Dharma was the pride of T'ang 
Buddhism (China). From the founding of 
the dynasty (6f8) to the An Lu-shun 
revolt (755), a succession of great 
minds and the schools they championed 
laid a philosophical foundation for the 
future of Mahayana Buddhism. These 
schools--T'ien-t'ai, Huayen, Pure Land, 
and Ch'an--can also be seen as bringing 
to maturity different forms of piety, 
stretching back to Indian origins. It is
 hard enough to see any unity to 
Mahayana in India, much less to discern 
a teleological structure in Sinitic (
<pb n="817"/>
Chinese) Mahayana. Yet the emergence of 
these four schools was not a fortuitous 
event, but accorded with the four 
optimal poles in Mahayana Buddhology. 
Buddhas could be either laukika or 
tokottara (mundane or transmundane), 
oriented to either prajna or karuna (
wisdom or compassion)... Early Buddhism 
knew only the 'historic didactic' 
Sakyamuni Buddha. The idealization of 
the Buddha began within the Mahasanghika
 (q.v.) school, which marked the shift 
from the historical to the 
transhistorical. It was with Mahayana 
that (transcendental, salvific Buddhas 
such as Amitabha) emerged; compassion 
was given equal status with wisdom in a 
host of new salvific Buddhas and 
Bodhisattvas. A total rehumanization of 
the Buddha was accomplished in East Asia
." 

(II) Easy Vs. Difficult Practice 
"The Pure Land school accepted the Zen 
perspective (on enlightenment) as valid 
in principle, but questioned how many 
people could get results by using Zen 
methods. Pure Land teachers granted that
 Zen might indeed be the 'supreme 
vehicle' but insisted that for most 
<pb n="818"/>
people it was too rigorous and demanding
 to be practical. The Pure Land method 
of Buddha name recitation was offered as
 a simpler method by which average 
people could make progress toward 
enlightenment..."

(III) Zen is Pure Land
"When Bodhidharma talked about Ch'an, he
 was directly pointing at the luminous 
self-nature. The one mind of 
universality is exactly this luminous 
self-nature. Even though the two 
traditions (of Ch'an and Pure Land) use 
different terms, what they realize is 
the same mind. Well indeed did Chung-
feng say this: 'The dhyana is the dhyana
 of the Pure Land, and the Pure Land is 
the Pure Land of Ch'an.' Some people 
might object by saying that Ch'an does 
not resort to the written word, whereas 
the Pure Land advocates the invocation 
of the name of Amitabha Buddha. But, 
they do not know that (in the Ch'an 
tradition) the Dharma is transmitted by 
a verse of four sentences and the 
imprinting on the mind is found in the 
four volumes of the scripture (the 
L4nkavatara Sutra). When these are 
compared with the four syllables of the 
<pb n="819"/>
name Amitabha, they are indeed far more 
wordy. As a matter of fact, not to rely 
on the written word does not mean to 
annihilate the written word. An 
enlightened person knows that it really 
means one should refuse to adhere to the
 written word and yet, at the same time,
 not cling to this refusal."

"Zen Master Yung-ming's syncretism went 
as far as to advocate the religious 
practice of the Nembutsu (Buddha 
Recitation) or invocation of the name of
 Amitabha Buddha. This was by no means a
 complete innovation, since three 
disciples of the Fifth Patriarch of Ch'
an-Fa-chih (635-702) and his disciple 
Chih-wei (646-722), the fourth and fifth
 patriarchs of the Ox-head school, as 
well as Chih-shen (609-702) -- had 
already practiced the nembutsu in 
addition to Zen meditation... During the
 Sung period, sometimes with the support
 of the masters and sometimes against 
their opposition, the nembutsu made 
greater and greater inroads into Zen 
monasteries. This process of mixing 
religious practices continued through 
the Yuan period and came to term during 
the Ming dynasty. The simultaneous 
<pb n="820"/>
practice of Zen and the nembutsu became 
a matter of common practice. In trying 
to judge this whole development, we must
 not forget the inner affinities of the 
two practices. The psychological effects
 of the meditative repetition of the 
holy name are close to the effects of 
Zen meditation... In China, the 
syncretistic tendencies and movements 
during the Sung period went on to meet 
with widespread success. 'In Zen 
monasteries, the invocation of Amitabha 
was practiced in combination with 
sitting in meditation. Moreover, during 
the Ming period we see a complete fusing
 of all Chinese Buddhists schools and 
sects. The more intellectually oriented 
schools of Avatamsaka and T'ien-T'ai as 
well as the Vinaya school were all cast 
in the same mold, the shape of which was
 determined principally by Zen and the 
Pure Land. Well-known Zen masters 
contributed to this unification. One of 
the most effective was the respected 
monk Chu-hung (1535-1615) who, after 
being admitted to monastic life by a Zen
 master, preached the dual practice of 
Zen and Buddha Recitation. This highly 
educated man left behind many writings. 
Han-shan Te-ch'ing (1546-1623), the best
<pb n="821"/>
 known Zen master at the end of the Ming
 period, also combined Zen practice with
 devotion to Amitabha Buddha, who, it 
said, appeared to him while he was 
invoking the holy name." (H. Dumoulin, 
Zen Buddhism: A History/India and China,
 p. 286.)

See also the following advice from the 
eminent 16th century Zen Master Chu Hung
 to a lay disciple: "This Pure Land Path
 is the most primal and the most subtle 
and wondrous. It is also the simplest. 
Because it is simple, those of high 
intelligence overlook it. Birth and 
death are not apart from a single moment
 of mindfulness. Consequently all the 
myriad worldly and world-transcending 
teachings and methods are not apart from
 a single moment of mindfulness. Right 
now take this moment of mindfulness, and
 be mindful of buddha, remember buddha, 
recite the buddha-name. How close and 
cutting! What pure essential energy, so 
solid and real! If you see through where
 this mindfulness arises, this is the 
Amitabha of our inherent nature. This is
 the meaning of the patriarch coming 
from the West (the meaning of Zen)." 

<pb n="822"/>
(IV) Note
"Throughout its history Buddhism (in 
East Asia) has tended to be the preserve
 of the members of an intellectual, 
spiritual and social elite, and the 
focus has almost everywhere been in the 
monasteries. Pure Land Buddhism, however
, has more general appeal. It offers an 
'easy practice' that can be implemented 
in the world, without becoming a monk or
 nun; and it promises salvation to 
everyone through Amitabha's vows -- to 
those still tied to the passions, even 
to those who have committed serious 
crimes. Profound study and meditation 
are moreover distrusted as they are seen
 as leading to intellectual and 
spiritual arrogance. Pure Land was 
therefore the first really democratic 
form of Buddhism, stressing humility 
rather than attainment, and as such 
became hugely successful among ordinary 
East Asians. Pious societies were 
spawned under its auspices, like the 
White Lotus Society which developed into
 a sizeable movement... In its heyday, 
the good works of its devotees included 
providing public amenities (bath-houses,
 hostels, mills, etc.), donating cloth, 
copying sutras and hosting vegetarian 
<pb n="823"/>
banquets. It was unusual in allowing 
women to play a prominent part in its 
affairs. Of the various schools that 
burgeoned in T'ang dynasty China, only 
Pure Land and Ch'an (Zen) had the 
vitality to survive the great 
Persecution of 845 (q.v.). Indeed, in 
East Asia the methods of both schools 
were often practiced in tandem for 
double effectiveness -- 'like a tiger 
wearing horns.'" (Patriarch Yin-Kuang) 

"According to Elder Master Yin Kuang, 
Pure Land followers should not seek 
guidance on Pure Land matters from Zen 
Masters. This is because the answers of 
Zen Masters are all directed towards 
principle and essence, while the Pure 
Land approach is based on phenomena and 
marks. This being the case, and 
considering the different areas of 
emphasis, beginning Pure Land 
practitioners who do not yet fully 
understand essence and marks, noumenon 
and phenomena, will not only fail to 
benefit from the answers of Zen Masters,
 they may develop even greater doubts, 
perplexity and inconsistent views." (
Buddhism of Wisdom of Faith.) 

<pb n="824"/>


<xa>ZEN</xa>
"Zen training is a process transcending 
thought, for intellect functions in 
duality, the 'moment' of Zen experience 
is in Non-duality. Normal logic is 
therefore worse than useless to achieve 
this experience; it binds the mind in 
the coils of concepts. Only when it is 
seen that A is A because A is not-A is 
the mind set free. This logic is the 
fruit of Zen experience and not a means 
to it. It can be stated, therefore, but 
not be the subject of intellectual 
argument."

<xa>Agadas</xa>
adj.: healthy; n.: antidote, panacea, 
universal remedy.



<xa>Agamas</xa>
Generic term applied to a collection of 
traditional doctrines and precepts; also
 means the home or collecting-place of 
the law or truth; the peerless law; the 
ultimate absolute truth.  The Four 
Agamas are as follows: (1) Dirghagama, "
law treatises on cosmogony; (2) 
Madhyamagama, "middle" treatises on 
metaphysics; (3) Samyuktagama, "
miscellaneous" treatises on abstract 
contemplation; (4) Edottaragama, "
numerical" treatises on subjects treated
 numerically.The sutras of Theravada are
 referred to at times as the Agamas.



<xa>Agara</xa>
House, dwelling, receptacle; also, used 
in the sense of a Bodily organ, e.g., 
the ear for sound, etc.
<pb n="826"/>



<xa>Agaru/Aguru</xa>
Sandalwood incense.



<xa>Alaya</xa>
The fundamental consciousness of all 
sentient beings. As defined by the 
Yogacara School, Alaya means the "
storehouse", implying that this 
consciousness contains and preserves all
 past memories and potential psychic 
energy within its fold; it is the 
reservoir of all ideas, memories and 
desires and is also the fundamental  
cause of both Samsara and Nirvana.



<xa>Almsgiving</xa>
see charity.



<xa>Amitabha(Amida,</xa>
Amitabha is the most commonly used name 
for the Buddha of Infinite Light and 
<pb n="827"/>
Infinite Life.  A transhistorical Buddha
 venerated by all Mahayana schools (T'
ien T'ai, Esoteric, Zen  ...) and, 
particularly, Pure Land. Presides over 
the Western Pure Land (Land of Ultimate 
Bliss), where anyone can be reborn 
through utterly sincere recitation of 
His name, particularly at the time of 
death.
Amitabha Buddha at the highest or 
noumenon level represents the True Mind,
 the Self-Nature common to the Buddhas  
and  sentient  beings  --  all-
encompassing  and all-inclusive. This 
deeper understanding provides the 
rationale for the harmonization of Zen 
and Pure Land, two of the most popular 
schools of Mahayana Buddhism. See also "
Buddha Reatation," "Mind," "Pure Land."



<xa>Amitabha</xa>

states, animal-birth and the hungry 
ghosts, or pretas.



<xa>Arhat</xa>
Arhatship is the highest rank attained 
by Sravakas. An Arhat is a Buddhist 
saint who has attained liberation from 
the cycle of Birth and Death, generally 
through living a monastic life in 
accordance with the Buddhas' teachings. 
This is the goal of Theravadin practice,
 as contrasted with Bodhisattvahood in 
Mahayana practice. (A Dictionary of 
Buddhism.)  The stage is preceded by 
three others: 1. Stream Winner, 2. Once-
<pb n="829"/>
Returner, 3. Non-Returner. See also "
Sravakas."

continuing effort on the path to 
enlightenment.



<xa>Asamkhiya</xa>

 of time. Each of the periodic 
manifestations and dissolutions of 
universes which go on eternally has four
 parts, called asamkhiya kalpas.



<xa>Asrava</xa>
<pb n="830"/>
(Skt.) Pain causing impurity, defilement
.



<xa>Asura</xa>
Titanic demons, enemies of the gods, 
with whom-especially Indra-they wage war
.



<xa>Attachment</xa>
In the Four Noble truths, Buddha 
Shakyamuni taught that attachment to 
self is the root cause of suffering:
From craving [attachment] springs grief,
 from craving springs fear; For him who 
is wholly free from craving, there is no
 grief, much less fear. (Dhammapada 
Sutra. In Narada Maha Thera, The Buddha 
and His Teachings.)
If you don't have attachments, naturally
 you're liberated ... In ancient times, 
there was an old cultivator who asked 
for instructions from a monk, "Great 
Monk, let me ask you, how can I attain 
liberation?"  The Great monk said, "Who 
tied you up?"  This old cultivator 
answered, "Nobody tied me up." The monk 
<pb n="831"/>
said, "Then why do you seek liberation?"
 (Hsuan Hua, tr., Flower Adornment Sutra
, "Pure Conduct," chap. 11.)
For the seasoned practitioner, even the 
Dharma must not become an attachment. As
 an analogy, to clean one's shirt, it is
 necessary to use soap. However, if the 
soap is not then rinsed out, the garment
 will not be truly clean. Similarly, the
 practitioner's mind will not be fully 
liberated until he severs attachment to 
everything, including the Dharma itself.



<xa>Avalokitesvara</xa>
The name is a compound of Ishwara, 
meaning Lord, and avalokita, looked upon
 or seen, and is usually translated as 
the Lord Who Observes (the cries of the 
world); the Buddhist embodiment of 
compassion as formulated in the Mahayana
 Dharma. Also called Kuan Yin, the 
Bodhisattva of Compassion. Guan Yin is 
one of the triad of Amitabha Buddha, 
represented on his left, Usually 
recognizable by the small Buddha 
adorning Her crown. Guan Yin can 
transform into many different forms in 
order to cross over to the beings. Guan 
<pb n="832"/>
Yin is one of the most popular 
Bodhisattva in China.



<xa>Avatamsaka</xa>
The basic text of the Avatamsaka School.
 It is one of the longest sutras in the 
Buddhist Canon and records the highest 
teaching of Buddha Shakyamuni, 
immediately after Enlightenment.   It is
 traditionally believed that the Sutra 
was taught to the Bodhisattvas and other
 high spiritual beings while the Buddha 
was in samadhi. The Sutra has been 
described as the "epitome of Buddhist 
thought, Buddhist sentiment and Buddhist
 experience" and is quoted by all 
schools of Mahayana Buddhism, in 
particular, Pure Land and Zen.



<xa>Awakening</xa>
A clear distinction should be made 
between awakening to the Way (Great 
Awakening) and attaining the Way (
attaining Enlightenment). (Note: There 
are many degrees of Awakening and 
Enlightenment. Attaining the 
<pb n="833"/>
Enlightenment of the Arhats, Pratyeka 
Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, etc. is different
 from attaining Supreme Enlightenment, i
.e., Buddhahood.)
To experience a Great Awakening is to 
achieve (through Zen meditation, Buddha 
Recitation, etc.) a complete and deep 
realization of what it means to be a 
Buddha and how to reach Buddhahood. It 
is to see one's Nature, comprehend the 
True Nature of things, the Truth. 
However, only after becoming a Buddha 
can one be said to have truly attained 
Supreme Enlightenment (attained the Way)
. A metaphor appearing in the sutras is 
that of a glass of water containing 
sediments. As long as the glass is 
undisturbed, the sediments remain at the
 bottom and the water is clear. However,
 as soon as the glass is shaken, the 
water becomes turbid.  Likewise, when a 
practitioner experiences a Great 
Awakening (awakens to the Way), his 
afflictions (greed, anger and delusion) 
are temporarily suppressed but not yet 
eliminated.  To achieve Supreme 
Enlightenment (i.e., to be rid of all 
afflictions, to discard all sediments) 
is the ultimate goal. Only then can he 
completely trust his mind and actions. 
<pb n="834"/>
Before then, he should adhere to the 
precepts, keep a close watch on his mind
 and thoughts, like a cat stalking a 
mouse, ready to pounce on evil thoughts 
as soon as they arise. To do otherwise 
is to court certain failure, as stories 
upon stories of errant monks, roshis and
 gurus demonstrate.



<xa>Awakening</xa>
A major commentary by the Patriarch 
Asvaghosha (lst/2nd cent.), which 
presents the fundamental principles of 
Mahayana Buddhism.   Several 
translations exist in English.



<xa>Ban</xa>
Suddhidanthaka in Sanskrit.  Ban T雊 was 
a disciple of Buddha, and he was very 
forgetful; for when the Buddha taught 
him the second sentence of a gatha of a 
sutra he would forget the first one, and
 when he was taught the third one he 
would forget the second one.  Ultimately
, however, with persistence he became an
 Arhat.
<pb n="835"/>



<xa>Bardo</xa>

 and  reincarnation -- a stage varying 
from seven to forty-nine days,  after 
which the Karmic body from previous 
lives will  certainly be reborn.

ordained monk. Bhiksuni is the 
equivalent term designating a woman.



<xa>Bhadanta</xa>

 to a Buddha.



<xa>Bhaisajyaguru</xa>

as thus, always or eternally so. True 
Suchness.



<xa>Bodhi</xa>
Sanskrit for Enlightenment. Also Perfect
 knowledge or wisdom by which a person 
becomes a Buddha.



<xa>Bodhi-Tao/Bodhi-path</xa>
The way or path to the Supreme 
Enlightenment of Buddhahood.



<xa>Bodhi</xa>
The spirit of Enlightenment, the 
aspiration to achieve it, the Mind set 
on Enlightenment.  It involves two 
parallel aspects: i) the determination 
to achieve Buddhahood and ii) the 
aspiration to rescue all sentient beings
<pb n="837"/>
.



<xa>Bodhimandala</xa>
Truth-plot, holy sits, place of 
Enlightenment, the place where the 
Buddha attained Enlightenment.



<xa>Bodhisattvas</xa>
Those who aspire to Supreme 
Enlightenment and Buddhahood for 
themselves and all beings. The word 
Bodhisattva can therefore stand for a 
realized being such as Avalokitesvara or
 Samantabhadra but also for anyone who 
has developed the Bodhi Mind, the 
aspiration to save oneself and others.



<xa>Bodhisattva-Tao</xa>
The way of the practitioner of Mahayana 
Buddhism.  One following this path 
aspires to the attainment of 
Enlightenment for the sake and benefit 
of all sentient beings.

<xa>Brahma</xa>
This is a sutra of major significance in
 Mahayana Buddhism.  In addition to 
containing the ten major precepts of 
Mahayana (not to kill, steal, lie, etc.)
 the Sutra also contains forty-eight 
less important injunctions.  These fifty
-eight major and minor precepts 
constitute the Bodhisattva Precepts, 
taken by most Mahayana monks and nuns 
and certain advanced lay practitioners.



<xa>Brahmacarya</xa>
Lit., Brahma or purified life, usually 
connoting the practice of celibacy.



<xa>Brahmajala</xa>
Or Indra's net, characterized by holding
 a luminous gem in every one of its eyes
. (Hindu mythology).



<xa>Brahmin</xa>
<pb n="839"/>
The highest of the four Castes in 
Hinduism. They served Brahma, his 
offering, the keepers of the Vedas, i.e.
 priestly.



<xa>Buddha</xa>
Lit., the Awakened One; one who through 
aeons of spiritual development has 
attained Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi. This 
epithet usually refers to Sakyamuni 
Buddha, who lived and taught in India 
some 2,600 years ago.



<xa>Buddha</xa>
The following terms refer to the same 
thing: Self-Nature, True Nature, 
Original Nature, Dharma Nature, True 
Mark, True Mind, True Emptiness, True 
Thusness, Dharma Body, Original Face, 
Emptiness, Prajna, Nirvana, etc.
According to the Mahayana view, [buddha-
nature] is the true, immutable, and 
eternal nature of all beings. Since all 
beings possess buddha-nature, it is 
possible for them to attain 
enlightenment and become a buddha, 
<pb n="840"/>
regardless of what level of existence 
they occupy ... The answer to the 
question whether buddha-nature is 
immanent in beings is an essential 
determining factor for the association 
of a given school with Theravada or 
Mahayana, the two great currents within 
Buddhism. In Theravada this notion is 
unknown; here the potential to become a 
buddha is not ascribed to every being. 
By contrast the Mahayana sees the 
attainment of buddhahood as the highest 
goal; it can be attained through the 
inherent buddha-nature of every being 
through appropriate spiritual practice. 
(The Shambhala Dictionary of Buddhism 
and Zen.)

<xa>Buddha</xa>
See "Buddha-Remembrance".



<xa>Buddha-Remembrance</xa>
General term for a number of practices, 
such as i) oral recitation of Amitabha 
Buddha's name and ii) visualization/
<pb n="841"/>
contemplation of His auspicious marks 
and those of the Pure Land.
In reciting the buddha-name you use your
 own mind to be mindful of your own true
 self: how could this be considered 
seeking outside yourself?
Reciting the buddha-name proceeds from 
the mind. The mind remembers Buddha and 
does not forget. That's why it is called
 buddha remembrance, or reciting the 
buddha-name mindfully.
The most common Pure Land technique is 
recitation of Amitabha Buddha's name. 
See also "Amitabha," "Pure Land."



<xa>Buddhadharma</xa>

<xa>Charity</xa>
or almsgiving, the first Paramitas. 
There are three kinds of charity in 
terms of goods, teaching (Dharma) and 
courage (fearlessness). Out of the three
, the merits and virtues of  the 
teaching of the Buddha Dharma is the 
most surpassing. Charity done for no 
reward here and hereafter is called pure
 or unsullied, while the sullied charity
 is done for the purpose of personal 
benefits. In Buddhism, the merits and 
virtues of pure charity is the best.



<xa>Chiliocosm</xa>

In practice there are three 
contemplations; seeing such abstractions
: (1) by fixing the mind on the nose,

existence.  "According to the Buddhist 
outlook, we are deluded by our senses-- 
among which intellect (discriminating, 
discursive thought) is included as a 
sixth sense. Consciousness, attached to 
the senses, leads us into error by 
causing us to take the world of 
appearances for the world of reality, 
whereas in fact it is only a limited and
 fleeting aspect of reality." (The 
Shambhala Dictionary of Buddhism and Zen
.)



<xa>Demons</xa>
Evil influences which hinder cultivation
. These can take an infinite number of 
forms, including evil beings or 
hallucinations. Disease and death, as 
well as the three poisons of greed, 
anger and delusion are also equated to 
demons, as they disturb the mind.
The Nirvana Sutra lists four types of 
demon: i) greed, anger and delusion; ii)
 the five skandas, or obstructions 
caused by physical and mental functions;
 iii) death; iv) the demon of the Sixth 
Heaven (Realm of Desire).
The Self-Nature has been described in 
<pb n="847"/>
Mahayana sutras as a house full of gold 
and jewelry. To preserve the riches, i.e
., to keep the mind calm, empty and 
still, we should shut the doors to the 
three thieves of greed, anger and 
delusion. Letting the mind wander opens 
the house to "demons," that is, 
hallucinations and harm. Thus, Zen 
practitioners are taught that, while in 
meditation, "Encountering demons, kill 
the demons, encountering Buddhas, kill 
the Buddhas."  Both demons and Buddhas 
are mind-made, Mind-Only.
For a detailed discussion of demons, see
 Master Thich Thien Tam, Buddhism of 
Wisdom and' Faith, sect. 51.



<xa>Devakanya</xa>
Goddess in general attendance on the 
regents of the sun and moon.



<xa>Deva</xa>
Lit., "A shining one". An inhabitant of 
the heavenly realms, which is 
characterized by long life, joyous 
surroundings and blissful states of mind
<pb n="848"/>
. In the Buddhist tradition, these 
states are understood to be impermanent,
 not eternal.



<xa>Deva</xa>
The four Deva Kings in the first, or 
lowest, Devaloka on its four sides are 
the following: East-Dhrtarastra; South-
Virodhaka; West-Viropaksa; North-Dhanada
, or Vaisravana.



<xa>Dharini</xa>
Extended mantra used in esoteric branch 
of Buddhism to focus and expand the mind
. Its words, or sounds, should not

<xa>Dharma-dhatu</xa>
The Law-doctrine that is the reality 
behind being and non-being. It is 
interpenetrative and all-inclusive, just
 as the rotation of the earth holds both
 night and day.



<xa>Dharma-Ending</xa>
The present spiritually degenerate era, 
twenty-six centuries after the demise of
 Shakyamuni Buddha. The concept of 
decline, dissension and schism within 
the Dharma after the passing of the 
Buddha is a general teaching of Buddhism
 and a corollary to the Truth of 
Impermanence. See, for example, the 
Diamond Sutra (sect. 6 in the 
translation by A.F. Price and Wong Mou-
lam). The time following Buddha 
Shakyamuni's demise is divided into 
three periods: i) the Perfect Age of the
 Dharma, lasting 500 years, when the 
Buddha's teaching (usually meditation) 
was correctly practiced and 
Enlightenment often attained; ii) the 
Dharma Semblance Age, lasting about 1,
000 years, when a form of the teaching 
<pb n="850"/>
was practiced but Enlightenment seldom 
attained; iii) the Dharma-Ending Age, 
lasting some ten thousand years, when a 
diluted form of the teaching exists and 
Enlightenment is rarely attained.



<xa>Dharma</xa>
School, method, tradition.



<xa>Dharma</xa>
The intrinsic nature of all things. Used
 interchangeably with "emptiness," "
reality." See also "Buddha Nature."



<xa>Dharmakara</xa>
The Bodhisattva who later became 
Amitabha Buddha, as related in the 
Longer Amitabha Sutra.  The Bodhisattva 
Dharmakara is famous for forty-eight 
Vows, particularly the eighteenth, which
 promises rebirth in the Pure Land to 
anyone who recites His name with utmost 
sincerity and faith at the time of death
.
<pb n="851"/>



<xa>Dharmakaya</xa>
See "Three bodies of the Buddha."



<xa>Dhyana</xa>
The practice of concentration--i.e., 
meditation. Also, more specifically, the
 four form concentrations and the four 
formless concentrations.



<xa>Diamond</xa>
"An independent part of the 
Prajnaparamita Sutra, which attained 
great importance, particularly in East 
Asia.  It shows that all phenomenal 
appearances are not ultimate reality but
 rather illusions, projections of one's 
own mind ... The work is called Diamond 
Sutra because it is 'sharp like  a  
diamond  that  cuts  away  all  
unnecessary conceptualizations and 
brings one to the further shore of 
enlightenment.'" (The Shambhala 
Dictionary of Buddhism and Zen.)
<pb n="852"/>



<xa>Difficult</xa>
According to Pure Land teaching, all 
conventional Buddhist ways of practice 
and cultivation (Zen, Theravada, the 
Vinaya School ...), which emphasize self
-power and self-reliance. This is 
contrasted to the Easy Path of Practice,
 that is, the Pure Land method, which 
relies on both self-power and other-
power (the power and assistance of the 
Buddhas and Bodhisattvas).



<xa>Duskrta</xa>
Wrongdoing, evil action, misdeed, sin; 
external sins of the body and the mouth;
 a light sin.



<xa>Dusts</xa>
A metaphor for all the mundane things 
that can cloud our bright Self-Nature. 
These include form, sound, scent, taste,
 touch, dharmas (external opinions and 
views). These dusts correspond to the 
<pb n="853"/>
five senses and the discriminating, 
everyday mind (the sixth sense, in 
Buddhism).



<xa>Dviyana</xa>
Lit., two vehicles. The two vehicles or 
practice paths of Sravakayana and 
Pratyekabuddhayana.



<xa>Dwo-Shih</xa>
An unusual term indicating one who has 
practiced the Tao  with great diligence 
and blessing during his lifetime and  
who, after his death, does not want to 
enter just any womb,  but prefers to 
wait for some auspicious condition, 
usurping  such a good position from 
another, less highly developed  spirit.



<xa>Easy</xa>
Refers to Pure Land practice. The Easy 
Path involves reliance on the power of 
the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, in 
particular Buddha Amitabha ("other-power
<pb n="854"/>
") in addition to one's own cultivation(
"self-power"). Usually contrasted with 
primary reliance on self-power (
Difficult Path of Practice), taught in 
other Buddhist schools. Equal reliance 
on self-power and other-power 
distinguishes the Pure Land School from 
most other schools of Buddhism.  The 
distinction is, however, a matter of 
emphasis, as all schools of Buddhism 
rely, to a greater or lesser extent, on 
both self-power and other-power. See 
also "Other-power".



<xa>Eight</xa>

<xa>Evil</xa>
The paths of hells, hungry ghosts, 
animality. These paths can be taken as 
states of mind; i.e., when someone has a
 vicious thought of maiming or killing 
another, he is effectively reborn, for 
that moment, in the hells.



<xa>Expedient</xa>
Refers to strategies, methods, devices, 
targetted to the capacities, 
circumstances, likes and dislikes of 
each sentient being, so as to rescue him
 and lead him to Enlightenment. "Thus, 
all particular formulations of the 
Teaching are just provisional expedients
 to communicate the Truth (Dharma) in 
specific contexts." (J.C. Cleary.) "The 
Buddha's words were medicines for a 
given sickness at a given time," always 
infinitely adaptable to the conditions 
of the audience.

<xa>Externalists</xa>
Literally, followers of non-Buddhist 
paths. This term is generally used by 
Buddhists with reference to followers of
 other religions.

into which  all existences are 
classified in early Buddhism. The five  
are: Rupa (matter), Vedana (feeling), 
Sanjna (ideation);  Samskara (forces or 
drives) Vijnana (consciousness or  
sensation). Group, heap, aggregate; the 
five constituents of  the personality; 
form, feeling, perception, impulses,  
consciousness; the five factors 
constituting the individual person.

<pb n="860"/>


<xa>Five</xa>
They are. 1. the defilement of views, 
when incorrect, perverse thoughts and 
ideas are predominant; 2. the defilement
 of passions, when all kinds of 
transgressions are exalted; 3. the 
defilement of the human condition, when 
people are usually dissatisfied and 
unhappy; 4. the defilement of the life-
span, when the human life-span as a 
whole decreases; S. the defilement of 
the world-age, when war and natural 
disasters are rife. These conditions, 
viewed from a Buddhist angle, however, 
can constitute aids to Enlightenment, as
 they may spur practitioners to more 
earnest cultivation.



<xa>Flower</xa>
The entire cosmos, consisting of worlds 
upon worlds ad infinitum, as described 
in the Avatamsaka Sutra. It is the realm
 of Vairocana Buddha, the transcendental

Vow Bodhisattva;
4.Avalokitesvara - Guan Shr Yin Great

These vows are called great because of 
the wondrous and inconceivable 
compassion involved in fulfilling them.

Beings and Saints (Land Where Saints and
 Ordinary Beings Dwell Together), where 
all beings, from the six lower worlds (
hells, hungry ghosts ...) to the Buddhas
  and Bodhisattvas, live together (
further divided into two, the Common

 of course, no difference among them.
<pb n="864"/>



<xa>Four</xa>
The four standards of Right Dharma which
 buddhist should rely on or abide by:
(1) to abide by the Dharma, not the 
person;

truth;
(3) to abide by the meaning, not the 
word;
(4) to abide by the wisdom, not the 
consciousness.

The mind of Bodhisattva: 1. Kindness; 2.
 Compassion; 3. Delight; 4. Renunciation

Or the Four Varga (groups) are bhiksu, 
bhiksuni, upasaka and upasika, i.e. 
monks, nuns, male and female devotees.



<xa>Good</xa>
<pb n="866"/>
Guru, virtuous friend, wise person, 
Bodhisattva, Buddha -- anyone (even an 
evil being!) who can help the 
practitioner progress along the path to 
Enlightenment. This notwithstanding, 
wisdom should be the primary factor in 
the selection of such an advisor: the 
advisor must have wisdom, and both 
advisor and practitioner must exercise 
wisdom in selecting one another.



<xa>Great</xa>
See "Awakening vs. Enlightenment."



<xa>Great</xa>
See Mahayana.



<xa>Hua</xa>
Lit., ante word. The reality prior to 
the arising of thought.



<xa>Heaven</xa>
<pb n="867"/>
A heaven in the Realm of Desire, with 
thirty-two god-kings presided over by 
Indra, thus totaling thirty-three, 
located at the summit of Mt. Sumeru (G.C
.C. Chang).

The sutras usually refer to sixty-two 
such views. They are the externalist (
non-Buddhist) views prevalent in Buddha 
Shakyamuni's time.



<xa>Hinayana</xa>
The Lesser Vehicle; a term applied by 
the Mahayana to those schools of 
Buddhism that practice to  attain  the  
fruits  of  Sravakayana  and 
Pratyekabuddhayana and do not attempt to
 attain the Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi of 
Buddha.



<xa>Holy</xa>

 of Indra, the king of the gods. At each
 interstice of the net is a reflecting 
jewel, which mirrors not only the 
<pb n="869"/>
adjacent jewels but the multiple images 
reflected in them. This famous image is 
meant to describe the unimpeded 
interpenetration of all and everything.



<xa>Kalpa</xa>
Periodic manifestations and dissolutions
 of universes which go on  etemally.  
Great  kalpas  consist  of four  
asamkhiya  kalpas corresponding to 
childhood. maturity, old age and the 
death of the universe.



<xa>Karma</xa>
Volition, volitional or intentional 
activity. Karma is always followed by 
its fruit, Vipaka. Karma and Vipaka are 
oftentimes referred to as the law of 
causality, a cardinal concern in the 
Teaching of the Buddha.
Common karma: the difference between 
personal and common karma can be seen in
 the following example: Suppose a 
country goes to war to gain certain 
economic advantages and in the process, 
numerous soldiers and civilians are 
<pb n="870"/>
killed or maimed. If a particular 
citizen volunteers for military service 
and actually participates in the carnage
, he commits a personal karma of killing
. Other citizens, however, even if 
opposed to the war, may benefit directly
 or indirectly (e.g., through economic 
gain). They are thus said to share in 
the common karma of killing of their 
country.
Fixed karma: in principle, all karma is 
subject to change. Fixed karma, however,
 is karma which can only be changed in 
extraordinary circumstances, because it 
derives from an evil act committed 
simultaneously with mind, speech and 
body. An example of fixed karma would be
 a premeditated crime (versus a crime of
 passion).



<xa>Kasaya</xa>
The monk's robe, or cassock.

China. It is a key Zen text, along with 
the Diamond Sutra (recommended by the 
Sixth Patriarch), the Surangama Sutra, 
<pb n="872"/>
the Vimalakirti Sutra, the Avatamsaka 
Sutra ... The last four sutras are 
referred to frequently in Pure Land 
commentaries.



<xa>Last</xa>

<xa>Law</xa>
It states that all phenomena arise 
depending upon a number of casual 
factors. In other word, a phenomenon 
exists in condition that the other exist
; it has in condition that others have; 
it extinguishes in condition that others
 extinguish; it has not in condition 
that others have not. For existence, 
there are twelve links in the chain:
Ignorance is the condition for karmic 
activity;
Karmic activity is the condition for 
consciousness;
Consciousness is the condition for the 
name and form;
Name and form is the condition for the 
six sense organs;
<pb n="873"/>
Six sense organs are the condition for 
contact;

<xa>Lesser</xa>
The early Buddhism. A term coined by 
Mahayanists to distinguish this school 
of Buddhism [whose modern descendent is 
Theravada] from Mahayana. It is so 
called because the teaching of this 
school puts emphasis on one's own 
liberation, whereas the teaching of 
Mahayana stresses the attainment of 
Buddhahood for all sentient beings. 
Theravada is now prevalent in southeast 
Asia, while Mahayana has spread over the
 northern area (China, Vietnam, Korea, 
Japan ...) (G.C.C. Chang).

<xa>Lotus</xa>
The nine possible degrees of rebirth in 
the Western Pure Land.  The more merits

, the higher the grade.



<xa>Lotus</xa>
A Buddhist sect founded by the great 
Master Hui Yuan  about 390 A.D. at his 
monastery on Mount Lu in Kiangsi 
Province   in China. The Lotus Sect 
believes in and honors Amitabha Buddha 
and declares that, through the chanting 
of his name and by purifying and finally
 ridding oneself of desire, one can be 
reborn in the Pure Land. There one is 
born of a lotus, and, depending on one's
 degree of purification and practice, 
one is born into one of the nine grades 
of the lotus: upper superior,   middle 
superior, lower superior, etc.



<xa>Lotus</xa>
<pb n="875"/>
Or Saddharma-pundarika, Dharma Flower, 
or "The Lotus of the True Law." The 
sutra is the basis for the Lotus sect (T
'ien-t'ai in Chinese). Among the sutras 
of the Mahayana canon.
One of the earliest and most richly 
descriptive of the Mahayana sutras of 
Indian origin. It became important for 
the shaping of the Buddhist tradition in
 East Asia, in particular because of its
 teaching of the One Vehicle under which
 are subsumed the usual Hinayana [
Theravada] and Mahayana divisions. It is
 the main text of the Tendai [T'ien T'ai
] school. (Joji Okazaki.)
This School has a historically close 
relationship with the Pure Land School. 
Thus, Master T'ai Hsu taught that the 
Lotus Sutra and the Amitabha Sutras were
 closely connected, differing only in 
length.

the same way that phenomena are 
contrasted with noumenon. True Mark 
stands for True Form, True Nature, 
Buddha Nature, always unchanging. The 
True Mark of all phenomena is like space
: always existing but really empty; 
although empty, really existing. The 
True Mark of the Triple World is No-
Birth/No-Death, not existent/not non-
existent, not like this/not like that. 
True Mark is also called "Self-Nature," 
"Dharma Body," the "Unconditioned," "

interchangeably. However, there is a 
crucial difference: merits are the 
blessings (wealth, intelligence, etc.) 
of the human and celestial realms; 
therefore, they are temporary and 
subject to Birth and Death. Virtues, on 
the other hand, transcend Birth and 
Death and lead to Buddhahood. Four 
virtues are mentioned in Pure Land 
Buddhism: eternity; happiness; True Self
; purity.     An identical action (e.g.,
 charity) can lead either to merit or 
virtue, depending on the mind of the 
practitioner, that is, on whether he is 
seeking mundane rewards (merit) or 
<pb n="881"/>
transcendence (virtue).  Thus, the Pure 
Land cultivator should not seek merits 
for by doing so, he would, in effect, be
 choosing to remain within samsara. This
 would be counter to his very wish to 
escape Birth and Death.



<xa>Middle</xa>
Also called Middle Doctrine School or 
Madhyarnika; one of the two main schools
 of Mahayana thought; it upholds the 
Void as the only really real or 
independent, unconditioned Reality.



<xa>Mind</xa>
Key concept in all Buddhist teaching.
Frequent term in Zen, used in two senses
: (1) the mind-ground, the One Mind ... 
the buddha-mind, the mind of thusness ..
. (2) false mind, the ordinary mind 
dominated by conditioning, desire, 
aversion, ignorance, and false sense of 
self, the mind of delusion ... (J.C. 
Cleary, A Buddha from Korea.)
The ordinary, deluded mind (thought) 
includes feelings, impressions, 
<pb n="882"/>
conceptions, consciousness, etc. The 
Self-Nature True Mind is the fundamental
 nature, the Original Face, reality, etc
. As an analogy, the Self-Nature True 
Mind is to mind what water is to waves -
- the two cannot be dissociated. They 
are the same but they are also different
. To approach the sutras "making 
discriminations and nurturing 
attachments is no different from the Zen
 allegory of a person attempting to lift
 a chair while seated on it. If he would
 only get off the chair, he could raise 
it easily.  Similarly, the practitioner 
truly understands the Dharma only to the
 extent that he "suspends the operation 
of the discriminating intellect, the 
faculty of the internal dialogue through
 which people from moment to moment 
define and perpetuate their customary 
world of perception." (See this book, 
Introduction.)
See also the following passage:
The mind ... "creates" the world in the 
sense that it invests the phenomenal 
world with value. The remedy to this 
situation, according to Buddhism, is to 
still the mind, to stop it from making 
discriminations and nurturing 
attachments toward certain phenomena and
<pb n="883"/>
 feelings of aversion toward others. 
When this state of calmness of mind is 
achieved, the darkness of ignorance and 
passion will be dispelled and the mind 
can perceive the underlying unity of the
 absolute. The individual will then have
 achieved the state of enlightenment and
 will be freed from the cycle of birth 
and death, because such a person is now 
totally indifferent to them both. (
Burton Watson, The Zen Teachings of 
Master Lin-Chi.)



<xa>Mindfulness</xa>

<pb n="884"/>
of Buddhism and the founder of the 
Madhyamika school. Nagarjuna's  major  
accomplishment  was  his systematization
  of the teaching  presented  in the 
Prajnaparamita Sutras. Nagarjuna's 
methodological approach of rejecting all
 opposites is the basis of the Middle 
Way (Shambhala Dictionary of Buddhism 
and Zen.)

having divine power.



<xa>Nirmanakaya</xa>

the Avatamsaka Sutra, a text 
particularly prized by the Pure Land and
 Zen schools alike.

<pb n="887"/>
 in Hinayana.



<xa>Other-Power</xa>
The issue of other-power (Buddhas' power
) is often misunderstood and glossed 
over by many Buddhists. However, it must
 be pointed out that, in Buddhism, other
-power is absolutely necessary if a 
Bodhisattva is to attain Ultimate 
Enlightenment.  The Lankavatara Sutra (
the only sutra recommended by 
Bodhidharma) and the Avatamsaka Sutra (
described by D.T. Suzuki as the epitome 
of Buddhist thought) are emphatically 
clear on this point:
As long as [conversion] is an experience
 and not mere understanding, it is 
evident that self-discipline plays an 
important role in the Buddhist life . 
but .. we must not forget the fact that 
the Lanka [Lankavatara Sutra] also 
emphasizes the necessity of the Buddha's
 power being added to  the Bodhisattvas'
, in their upward course  of  spiritual 
 development  and  in  the 
accomplishment of their great task of 
world salvation. (Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki
, tr., The Lankavatara Sutra, p. xviii.)
<pb n="888"/>
The Avatamsaka Sutra states:
Having purified wisdom and means in the 
seventh stage ...
The great sages attain acceptance of non
-origination ...
On the basis of their previous 
resolution, the buddhas further exhort 
them ...:
"Though you have extinguished the 
burning of the fire of affliction,
Having seen the world still afflicted, 
remember your past vows;
Having thought of the welfare of the 
world, work in quest Of the cause of 
knowledge, for the liberation of the 
world."
(T. Cleary, tr., The Flower Ornament 
Sutra, Vol II, p. 86)
See also "Easy Path of Practice."

following: (1) Dana,  charity or giving,
 including the bestowing of truth on  
others; (2) Sila, keeping the discipline
; (3) Ksanti,  patience under suffering 
and insult; (4) Virya, zeal and  
progress; (5) Dhyana, meditation or 
contemplation; (6)  Prajna, wisdom, the 
power to discern reality or truth. It is
  the perfection of the last one -- 
Prajna -- that ferries  sentient beings 
across the ocean of Samsara (the sea of 
incarnate life) to the shores of Nirvana
.

<xa>Pure</xa>
Generic term for the realms of the 
Buddhas. In this text it denotes the 
Land of Ultimate Bliss or Western Land 
of Amitabha Buddha. It is not a realm of
 enjoyment, but rather an ideal place of
 cultivation, beyond the Triple Realm 
<pb n="892"/>
and samsara, where those who are reborn 
are no longer subject to retrogression. 
This is the key distinction between the 
Western Pure Land and such realms as the
 Tusita Heaven. There are two 
conceptions of the Pure Land: as 
different and apart from the Saha World 
and as one with and the same as the Saha
 World. When the mind is pure and 
undefiled, any land or environment 
becomes a pure land (Vimalakirti, 
Avatamsaka Sutras ...). See also "Triple
 Realm."



<xa>Pure</xa>
When Mahayana Buddhism spread to China, 
Pure Land ideas found fertile ground for
 development. In the fourth century, the
 movement crystallized with the 
formation of the Lotus Society, founded 
by Master Hui Yuan (334-416), the first 
Pure Land Patriarch.  The school was 
formalized under the Patriarchs T'an 
Luan (Donran) and Shan Tao (Zendo).  
Master Shan Tao's teachings, in 
particular, greatly influenced the 
development of Japanese Pure Land, 
associated with Honen Shonin (Jodo 
<pb n="893"/>
school) and his disciple, Shinran Shonin
 (Jodo Shinshu school) in the 12th and 
13th centuries.   Jodo Shinshu, or Shin 
Buddhism, places overwhelming emphasis 
on the element of faith.



<xa>[Pure</xa>
Note: An early form of Buddha Recitation
 can be found in the Nikayas of the Pali
 Canon:
In the Nikayas, the Buddha ... advised 
his disciples to think of him and his 
virtues as if they saw his body before 
their eyes, whereby they would be 
enabled to accumulate merit and attain 
Nirvana or be saved from transmigrating 
in the evil paths ... (D.T. Suzuki, The 
Eastern Buddhist, Vol.3, No.4, p.317.)

<pb n="908"/>

<xa>Third</xa>
In the first lifetime, the practitioner 
engages in mundane good deeds which 
bring ephemeral worldly blessings (
wealth, power, authority, etc.) in the 
second lifetime. Since power tends to 
corrupt, he is likely to create evil 
karma, resulting in retribution in the 
third lifetime. Thus, good deeds in the 
first lifetime are potential "enemies" 
of the third lifetime. To ensure that 
mundane good deeds do not become "
enemies the practitioner should dedicate
 all merits to a transcendental goal, i.
e., to become Bodhisattvas or Buddhas or
, in Pure Land teaching, to achieve 
rebirth in the Pure Land -- a Buddha 
land beyond Birth and Death.
In a mundane context, these three 
lifetimes can be conceived of as three 
generations. Thus, the patriarch of a 
prominent family, through work and luck,
 amasses great power, fortune and 
influence (first lifetime). His children
 are then able to enjoy a leisurely, and
, too often, dissipated life (second 
lifetime). By the generation of the 
grandchildren, the family's fortune and 
good reputation have all but disappeared
<pb n="909"/>
 (third lifetime).



<xa>Thirty-seven</xa>

<xa>Three</xa>
1. Dharmakaya: The Dharma-body, or the "
body of reality", which is formless, 
unchanging, transcendental, and 
inconceivable. Synonymous with suchness,
 or emptiness. 2. Sambhogakaya: the "
body of enjoyment", the celestial body 
of the Buddha. Personification of 
eternal perfection in its ultimate sense
. It "resides" in the Pure Land and 
never manifests itself in the mundane 
world, but only in the celestial spheres
, accompanied by enlightened 
Bodhisattvas. 3. Nirmanakaya: the "
incarnated body" of the Buddha. In order
 to benefit certain sentient beings, a 
<pb n="910"/>
Buddha incarnates himself into an 
appropriate visible body, such as that 
of Sakyamuni Buddha.
The incarnated body of the Buddha should
 not be confused with a magically 
produced Buddha. The former is a real, 
tangible human body which has a definite
 life span, The latter is an illusory 
Buddha-form which is produced with 
miraculous
powers and can be withdrawn with 
miraculous powers (G.C.C. Chang).



<xa>Three</xa>
See "Evil Paths."



<xa>Three</xa>
In Sanskrit, Rathatraya. Buddha, Dharma 
and Sangha; sometimes referred to as the
 Teacher, the Teaching and the Taught.



<xa>Three</xa>
The three conditions, inheritances or 
karmas, of which there are several 
<pb n="911"/>
groups, including the karmas of deeds, 
words and thoughts.



<xa>Three</xa>
Craving, aversion and delusion; also, 
these are termed the three root-stains  
or the three roots of unskillfulness.



<xa>Three</xa>
Pure Land Buddhism is based on three 
basic sutras:
a) Amitabha Sutra (or Shorter Amitabha 
Sutra, or Smaller Sukhavati-Vyuha, or 
the Sutra of Amida);
b) Longer Amitabha Sutra (or Longer 
Sukhavati-Vyuha, or the Teaching of 
Infinite Life);
c) Meditation Sutra (or the Meditation 
on the Buddha of Infinite Life, or the 
Amitayus Dhyana Sutra).
Sometimes the last chapter of the 
Avatamsaka Sutra ("The Practices and 
Vows of the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra") 
is considered the fourth basic sutra of 
the Pure Land tradition. Note: in Pure 
Land, the Longer Amitabha Sutra is 
<pb n="912"/>
considered a shorter form of the Lotus 
Sutra.
Three Realms (Triple Realm, Three Worlds
)
The realms of desire (our world), form (
realms of the lesser deities) and 
formlessness (realms of the higher 
deities). The Western Pure Land is 
outside the Triple Realm, beyond samsara
 and retrogression. See also "Pure Land.
"

in the Buddha's Awakening, in his 
Teaching and in the Sangha of

The yanas of Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas 
and Bodhisattvas.



<xa>T'ien</xa>
A major school that takes the Lotus 
<pb n="913"/>
Sutra as its principal text. 
Historically, it has had a close 
relationship with Pure Land. See also "
Lotus Sutra."



<xa>Tolerance</xa>
"Tolerance" (insight) that comes from 
the knowledge that all phenomena are 
unborn. Sometimes translated as "insight
 into the non-origination of all 
existence/non-origination of the dharmas
."
A Mahayana Buddhist term for the insight
 into emptiness, the non-origination or 
birthlessness of things or beings 
realized by Bodhisattvas who have 
attained the eighth Stage [Ground] of 
the path to Buddhahood. When a 
Bodhisattva realizes this insight he has
 attained the stage of non-retrogression
. (Ryukoku University.)
The Pure Land School teaches that anyone
 reborn in the Pure Land attains the 
Tolerance of Non-Birth and reaches the 
stage of non-retrogression, never to 
fall back into samsara. See also "Non-
Birth."

<pb n="914"/>


<xa>Transference</xa>
The concept of merit transference, or 
sharing one's own merits and virtues 
with others, is reflected in the 
following passage:
Some of us may ask whether the effect of
 [evil] karma can be... [changed] by 
repeating the name of Kuan-Yin. This 
question is tied up with that of rebirth
 in Sukhavati [the Pure Land] and it may
 be answered by saying that invocation 
of Kuan-Yin's name forms another cause 
which will right away offset the 
previous karma. We know, for example) 
that if there is a dark, heavy cloud 
above, the chances are that it will rain
. But we al50 know that if a strong wind
 should blow, the cloud will be carried 
away somewhere else and we will not feel
 the rain. Similarly, the addition of 
one big factor can alter the whole 
course of karma
It is only by accepting the idea of life
 as one whole that both Theravadins and 
Mahayanists can advocate the practice of
 transference of merit to others. With 
the case of Kuan-Yin then, by calling on
 Her name we identify ourselves with Her
<pb n="915"/>
 and as a result of this identification,
 Her merits flow over to us. These 
merits which are now ours then 
counterbalance our bad karma and save us
 from calamity. The law of cause and 
effect still stands good. All that has 
happened is that a powerful and 
immensely good karma has overshadowed 
the weaker one. (Lecture on Kuan-Yin by 
Tech Eng Soon - Penang Buddhist 
Association, c. 1960. Pamphlet.)

<xa>Two</xa>
1) Relative or conventional, everyday 
truth of the mundane world subject to 
delusion and dichotomies and 2) the 
Ultimate Truth, transcending dichotomies
, as taught by the Buddhas.
According to Buddhism, there are two 
kinds of Truth, the Absolute and the 
Relative. The Absolute Truth (of the 
Void) manifests "illumination but is 
always still," and this is absolutely 
inexplicable. On the other hand, the 
Relative Truth (of the Unreal) manifests
 "stillness but is always illuminating,"
 which means that it is immanent in 
everything. (Hsu Heng Chi/P.H. Wei).
Pure Land thinkers such as the Patriarch
 Tao Ch'o accepted "the legitimacy of 
Conventional Truth as an expression of 
Ultimate Truth and as a vehicle to reach
 Ultimate Truth. Even though all form is
 nonform, it is acceptable and necessary
 to use form within the limits of 
causality, because its use is an 
expedient means of saving others out of 
<pb n="917"/>
one's compassion for them and because, 
even for the unenlightened, the use of 
form can lead to the  revelation of form
 as nonform" (David Chappell). Thus to 
reach Buddhahood, which is formless, the
 cultivator can practice the Pure Land 
method based on form.

<xa>Vimalakirti</xa>
Also called Vimalakirti Nirdesa Sutra. A
 key Mahayana sutra particularly popular
 with Zen and to a lesser extent Pure 
Land followers. The main protagonist is 
a layman named Vimalakirti who is the 
equal of many Bodhisattvas in wisdom, 
eloquence, etc. He explained the 
teaching of Emptiness in terms of non-
duality ... "The true nature of things 
is beyond the limiting concepts imposed 
by words." Thus, when asked by Manjusri 
to define the non-dual Truth, 
Vimalakirti simply remained silent.

Visualization]: (1) visualization of the
 sun, (2) visualization of water, (3) 
visualization of the ground [in the Pure
 Land], (4) visualization of the trees, 
(5) visualization of the lake[s], (6)  
unified  visualization  of  the  [50  
billion] storied-pavilions, trees, lakes
, and so forth, (7) visualization of the
 [lotus throne of Amitabha Buddha], (8) 
<pb n="922"/>
visualization of the images of the 
Buddha [Amitabha] and Bodhisattvas [
Avalokitesvara and Mahasthamaprapta], (9
) visualization of the [Reward body of 
Amitabha Buddha, i.e., the form in which
 He appears in the Pure Land], (10) 
visualization of Avalokitesvara, (11) 
visualization of Mahasthamaprapta, (12) 
visualization of one's own rebirth, (13)
 [see below], (14) visualization of the 
rebirth of the highest grades, (15) 
visualization of the rebirth of the 
middle grades and (16) visualization of 
the rebirth of the lowest grades. (K.K. 
Tanaka, The Dawn of Chinese Pure Land 
Doctrine.)
The 13th Visualization has been 
summarized as follows:
If one cannot visualize the [Reward body
 of Amitabha Buddha], focus on the small
 body, which is sixteen cubits high (the
 traditional height of Shakyamuni while 
he dwelt on earth); contemplate an 
intermingling of the [Reward] and small 
bodies. (1oji Okazaki, p.52.)
Visualizations 14-16 refer to the nine 
lotus grades (of rebirth), divided into 
three sets of three grades each.

<xa>Zen</xa>
A major school of Mahayana Buddhism, 
with several branches. One of its most 
popular techniques is meditation on 
koans, which leads to the generation of 
the Great Doubt. According to this 
method:
The master gives the student a koan to 
think about, resolve, and then report 
back on to the master. Concentration 
intensifies as the student first tries 
to solve the koan intellectually. This 
initial effort proves impossible, 
however, for a koan cannot be solved 
rationally. Indeed, it is a kind of 
spoof on the human intellect. 
Concentration and irrationality -- these
 two elements constitute the 
characteristic psychic situation that 
engulfs the student wrestling with a 
<pb n="925"/>
koan. As this persistent effort to 
concentrate intellectually becomes 
unbearable, anxiety sets in.  The 
entirety of one's consciousness and 
psychic life is now filled with one 
thought. The exertion of the search is 
like wrestling with a deadly enemy or 
trying to make one's way through a ring 
of flames. Such assaults on the fortress
 of human reason inevitably give rise to
 a distrust of all rational perception. 
 This gnawing doubt [Great Doubt], 
combined with a futile search for a way 
out, creates a state of extreme and 
intense yearning for deliverance. The 
state may persist for days, weeks or 
even years; eventually the tension has 
to break. (Dumoulin, Zen Buddhism, Vol. 
I, p.253.)
An interesting koan is the koan of 
Buddha Recitation. Unlike other koans, 
it works in two ways. First of all, if a
 cultivator succeeds in his meditation 
through this koan, he can achieve 
awakening as with other koans. However, 
if he does not succeed, and experience 
shows that many cultivators do not, then
 the meditation on the Buddha's narne 
helps him to achieve rebirth in the Pure
 Land.  This is so provided he believes 
<pb n="926"/>
(as most practitioners in Asia do) in 
Amitabha and the expedient Pure Land.  
Thus, the Buddha Recitation koan 
provides a safety net, and demonstrates 
the underlying unity of Zen and Pure 
Land.
