From The Preface To The First Edition
 
As a first attempt of an authentic 
<pb n="2"/>
dictionary of Buddhist doctrinal terms, 
used in the Páli Canon and its 
Commentaries, this present manual will 
fill a real gap felt by many students of
 Buddhism. It provides the reader not 
with a mere superficial enumeration of 
important Páli terms and their English 
equivalents, but offers him precise and 
authentic definitions and explanations 
of canonical and post-canonical terms 
and doctrines, based on Sutta, 
Abhidhamma and Commentaries, and 
illustrated by numerous quotations taken
 from these sources, so that, if anyone 
wishes, he could, by intelligently 
joining together the different articles,
 produce without difficulty a complete 
exposition of the entire teachings of 
Buddhism.

As already pointed out by the author in 
the preface to his Guide through the 
Abhidhamma-Pitaka (Colombo 1938), there 
are found in the Abhidhamma Canon 
numerous technical terms not met with in
 the Sutta Canon; and again other terms 
are found only in the Commentaries and 
not in Sutta and Abhidhamma. The author 
therefore has made a first attempt - 
without, however, laying any claim to 
<pb n="3"/>
absolute reliability or completeness in 
this by no means easy undertaking - to 
indicate in the Appendix all the terms 
that in the oldest Sutta texts are 
either not found at all, or at least not
 in the same form or meaning, and to set
 forth how far these are deviations from
 the older texts, or further 
developments.

In this connection, the author wishes to
 state that the often quoted Patisambhid
á-Magga, as well as Niddesa, Buddhavamsa
 and Cariyapitaka, though included in 
the Khuddaka Nikáya of the Sutta Pitaka,
 nevertheless bear throughout the 
character of Commentaries, and though 
apparently older than the Sutta 
Commentaries handed down to us in 
Buddhaghosa's version, must doubtless 
belong to a later period of origin than 
the Abhidhamma Canon.

In rendering the terms into English, I 
often had to differ considerably from 
the interpretation of Western scholars, 
and to introduce quite new words. A 
great number of such earlier 
translations must be considered partly 
as totally incorrect, partly as 
<pb n="4"/>
misleading, or at the very least 
ambiguous. Incorrect are, for instance, 
the English renderings of náma-rúpa by '
name and form'; javana (impulsion, i.e. 
the karmic impulsive moments) by '
apperception', etc.

The expositions concerning the true 
nature of the 8-fold Path, the 4 Noble 
Truths, the paticca-samuppáda and the 5 
groups of existence - doctrines which, 
with regard to their true nature, have 
been often misunderstood by Western 
authors - are sure to come to many as a 
revelation.

On the doctrine of anattá, or '
egolessness', i.e. the impersonality and
 emptiness of all phenomena of existence
, the author repeatedly felt the 
necessity of throwing light from every 
possible point of view, for it is 
exactly this doctrine which, together 
with the doctrine of the conditionality 
of all phenomena of existence, 
constitutes the very essence of the 
whole Teaching of the Buddha without 
which it will be by no means possible to
 understand it in its true light. Thus 
the doctrine of impersonality runs like 
<pb n="5"/>
a red thread right through the whole 
book.

May this little manual provide an ever-
helpful companion and vade mecum to all 
earnest students in their study of the 
original Buddhist scriptures, and also 
give to Buddhist authors and lecturers 
the opportunity of supplementing and 
deepening their knowledge of the 
profound teachings of the Buddha!
Should it, for a better understanding, 
prove necessary to give to certain 
subjects a more detailed treatment, the 
carrying out of this task may be 
reserved for a later edition of this 
work.

Editor's Preface To The Third Edition
 
The present revised and enlarged Third 
Edition was intended to be issued in 
commemoration of the tenth anniversary 
of the venerable author's passing away 
on 28th May 1957. But due to unavoidable
<pb n="6"/>
 circumstances the publication had to be
 delayed.

It was the venerable author's wish to 
enlarge the first edition of this work, 
but when a second edition became 
necessary, he was prevented from 
expanding it by the illness to which he 
later succumbed. It rested, therefore, 
with his pupil, the present editor, to 
make, within the original scope and 
character of the work, such additions 
and revisions as seemed useful.

Over seventy articles have been expanded
 and partly rewritten; others were 
slightly revised; more source references
 were included, and information on 
literature for further study of the 
respective subjects was added to some of
 the articles. But only very few new 
words have been added (e.g. anupassaná, 
ánupubbi-kathá, etc.). This restriction 
was observed because the venerable 
author himself thought only of 'a more 
detailed treatment' of existing articles
 (see Preface to the 1st ed.) as he 
obviously wished to preserve the 
original form and character of the book.
 It was also considered that the adding 
<pb n="7"/>
of more words such as those coined in 
later commentarial and abhidhammic 
literature, would be superfluous as in 
the English language such terms will 
generally be found only in a few 
scholarly books and translations which 
themselves give the explanations needed.

This book is chiefly intended for those 
who study the Buddhist teachings through
 the medium of the English language, but
 wish to familiarize themselves with 
some of the original Páli terms of 
doctrinal import. They are in the same 
position as a student of philosophy or 
science who has to know the terminology 
of his field, which for common parlance 
is mostly not less 'unfamiliar' than are
 the words of the Páli language found in
 the Dictionary.

Such acquaintance with the Páli terms of
 the original texts will also be useful 
to the student for the purpose of 
identifying the various renderings of 
them favored by different translators. 
It is deplorable that there is a 
considerable multiplication of new 
English coining for the same doctrinal 
term. This great variety of renderings 
<pb n="8"/>
has proved to be confusing to those 
students of Buddhism who are not 
familiar with the Páli language. Even at
 this late stage when many translations 
of Páli texts are in print, it will be 
desirable if, for the sake of uniformity
, translators forgo their preference for
 their own coining, even if they think 
them better than others. In any case, 
doctrinal terms have to be known by 
definition, just as in the case of 
philosophical and technical terms in a 
Western language.

As a small help in the situation 
described, a number of alternative 
renderings used by other translators 
have been included in some articles of 
this edition. In a very few cases, 
unacceptable though familiar renderings 
have been bracketed. The Venerable 
Nyanatiloka's own preferences have been 
placed in inverted commas. Generally it 
may be said that his renderings, based 
on his comprehensive knowledge of texts 
and doctrine, are very sound and 
adequate. Only in a very few cases has 
the editor changed the author's 
preferred rendering e.g. 'canker' for á
sava (instead of 'bias'), 'right view' 
<pb n="9"/>
for sammá-ditthi (instead of 'right 
understanding'). The latter change was 
made for the sake of economizing with 
the few English equivalents for the 
numerous Páli synonyms for 'knowing', 
etc.; and also to avoid having to render
 the opposite term, micchá-ditthi, by '
wrong understanding'.
This Dictionary appeared also in the 
author's own German version (published 
by Verlag Christiani, Konstanz, Germany)
 and in a French translation made by the
 late Mme Suzanne Karpeles (published by
 'Adyar', Paris, 1961).

 of insight; s. vipassana^, further a^na

 ascetic means to purification (dhutanga
, q.v.).

<xa>aberration</xa>

<xa>abhabba^gamana</xa>
 'incapable of progressing'... 
"Those beings 
who are obstructed by their evil actions
 (kamma, s. karma),  
by their defilements (kilesa, q.v.),  
by the result of their evil actions (s. 
vipa^ka),  
or who are devoid of faith,  
energy and  
knowledge, and  
unable to enter the right path and reach
 perfection in wholesome things,  
all those are said to be incapable of 
progressing" (Pug. 13). 
<pb n="13"/>
According to Commentary the 'evil 
actions' denote the 5 heinous deeds with
 immediate result (a^nantarika-kamma, q.
v.), whilst the 'defilements' refer to 
the 'evil views with fixed destiny' (
niyata-miccha^-ditthi; s. ditthi).

<xa>a^bhassara</xa>
 he 'Radiant Ones', are a class of 
heavenly beings of the fine-material 
world (rúpa-loka); cf. deva.

<xa>abhibha^yatana</xa>
 he 8 'stages of mastery', ... 
the 8 'stages of mastery', are powers to
 be obtained by means of the kasina-
exercises (s. kasina). In the Com. to M.
77, where a^yatana is explained by '
means' (ka^rana) it is said: "The 
abhibha^yatana through their 
counteracting may master (suppress) the 
adverse states, and by means of higher 
knowledge they may master the objects of
 mind." They are means for transcending 
the sensuous sphere.
The stereotype text often met with in 
the Suttas (e.g. D.11, D.33; M.77; A.
VIII.65; A.X.29) is as follows:
(1) "Perceiving (blue..., red..., yellow
..., white) forms on one's own body, one
<pb n="14"/>
 sees forms externally small ones, 
beautiful or ugly; and in mastering 
these one understands: 'I know, I 
understand.' This is the first stage of 
mastery.
(2) "Perceiving forms on one's own body,
 one sees forms externally, large ones .
... This is the second stage of mastery.
(3) "Not perceiving forms on one's own 
body, one sees forms externally, small 
ones .... This is the third stage of 
mastery.
(4) "Not perceiving forms on one's own 
body, one sees forms externally, large 
ones .... This is the fourth stage of 
mastery.
(5) "Not perceiving forms on one's own 
body, one sees forms externally, blue 
forms, forms of blue colour, blue 
appearance, blue lustre, and mastering 
these one understands: 'I know, I 
understand. This is the fifth stage of 
mastery."
(6-8) The same is repeated with yellow, 
red and white forms.
As preparatory kasina-object for the 1st
 and 2nd exercise one should choose on 
one's own body a small or a large spot, 
beautiful or ugly, and thereon one 
should concentrate one's full undivided 
<pb n="15"/>
attention, so that this object after a 
while reappears as mental reflex or 
image (nimitta, q.v.) and, as it were, 
as something external. Such an exercise,
 though appearing quite mechanical, if 
properly carried out will bring about a 
high degree of mental concentration and 
entrance into the 4 absorptions (jha^na,
 q.v.). In the 3rd and 4th exercises the
 monk by an external kasina-object gains
 the mental reflexes and absorptions. As
 objects of the remaining exercises, 
perfectly clear and radiant colours 
should be chosen, flowers, cloth, etc.
A kasina-object of small size is said to
 be suitable for a mentally unsteady 
nature, one of a large size for a dull 
nature, a beautiful object for an angry 
nature, an ugly one for a lustful nature
.
In Vis.M. V it is said: "By means of the
 earth-kasina one succeeds in reaching 
the stage of mastery with regard to 
small and large objects .... By means of
 the blue-kasina one succeeds in causing
 blue forms to appear, in producing 
darkness, in reaching the stage of 
mastery with regard to beautiful and 
ugly colours, in reaching 'deliverance 
through the beautiful', etc." (cf. 
<pb n="16"/>
vimokkha II, 3). The same is also said 
with regard to the other colour kasinas.

<xa>abhijjha^</xa>
  'covetousness' is a synonym of lobha (
s. múla) and tanha^ (q.v.) and is the 
8th link of the unwholesome courses of 
action (s. kamma-patha, I).

<xa>abhinibbatti</xa>
  a Sutta term for rebirth; s. 
punabbhava.

<xa>abhin~n~a^</xa>
  The 6 'higher powers', or supernormal 
knowledge's, ... 
The 6 'higher powers', or supernormal 
knowledge's, consist of 5 mundane (
lokiya, q.v.) powers attainable through 
the utmost perfection in mental 
concentration (sama^dhi, q.v.) and one 
supermundane (lokuttara, q.v.) power 
attainable through penetrating insight (
vipassana^, q.v.), i.e. extinction of 
all cankers (a^savakkhaya; s. a^sava), 
in other words, realization of 
Arahatship or Holiness. 
They are: 
(1) magical powers (iddhi-vidha),  
(2) divine ear (dibba-sota),  
<pb n="17"/>
(3) penetration of the minds of others (
ceto-pariya-n~a^na),  
(4) remembrance of former existences (
pubbe-niva^sa^nussati),  
(5) divine eye (dibba-cakkhu),  
(6) extinction of all cankers (a^
savakkhaya).  
The stereotype text met with in all the 
4 Sutta-collections (e.g. D.34; M.4, M.6
, M.77; A.III.99; A.V.23; S.15.9 and Pug
.271, Pug.239) is as follows:
(1) "Now, O Bhikkhus, the monk enjoys 
the various magical powers (iddhi-vidha)
, such as being one he becomes manifold,
 and having become manifold he again 
becomes one. He appears and disappears. 
Without being obstructed he passes 
through walls and mountains, just as if 
through the air. In the earth he dives 
and rises up again, just as if in the 
water. He walks on water without sinking
, just as if on the earth. Cross-legged 
he floats through the air, just like a 
winged bird. With his hand he touches 
the sun and moon, these so mighty ones, 
so powerful ones. Even up to the Brahma-
world he has mastery over his body. 
(2) "With the divine ear (dibba-sota) he
 hears sounds both heavenly and human, 
far and near. 
<pb n="18"/>
(3) "He knows the minds of other beings 
(parassa ceto-pariya-n~a^na), of other 
persons, by penetrating them with his 
own mind. He knows the greedy mind as 
greedy and the not-greedy one as not 
greedy; knows the hating mind as hating 
and the not-hating one as not hating; 
knows the deluded mind as deluded and 
the not-deluded one as not deluded; 
knows the shrunken mind and the 
distracted one, the developed mind and 
the undeveloped one, the surpassable 
mind and the unsurpassable one, the 
concentrated mind and the unconcentrated
 one, the freed mind and the unfreed one
. 
(4) "He remembers manifold former 
existences (pubbe-niva^sa^nussati), such
 as one birth, two, three, four and five
 births .... hundred thousand births; 
remembers many formations and 
dissolutions of worlds: 'There I was, 
such name I had .... and vanishing from 
there I entered into existence somewhere
 else .... and vanishing from there I 
again reappeared here.' Thus he 
remembers, always together with the 
marks and peculiarities, many a former 
existence . 
(5) ''With the divine eye (dibba-cakkhu 
<pb n="19"/>
= yatha^-kammúpaga-n~a^na or cutúpapa^ta
-n~a^na), the pure one, he sees beings 
vanishing and reappearing, low and noble
 ones, beautiful and ugly ones, sees how
 beings are reappearing according to 
their deeds (s. karma): 'These beings, 
indeed, followed evil ways in bodily 
actions, words and thoughts, insulted 
the noble ones, held evil views, and 
according to their evil views they acted
. At the dissolution of their body, 
after death, they have appeared in lower
 worlds, in painful states of existence,
 in the world of suffering, in hell. 
Those other beings, however, are endowed
 with good action .... have appeared in 
happy state of existence, in a heavenly 
world. 
(6) "Through the extinction of all 
cankers (a^savakkhaya) even in this very
 life he enters into the possession of 
deliverance of mind, deliverance through
 wisdom, after having himself understood
 and realized it.'' 
4-6 appear frequently under the name of 
the 'threefold (higher) knowledge' (te-
vijja^, q.v.). They are, however, not a 
necessary condition for the attainment 
of sainthood (arahatta), i.e. of the 
sixth abhin~n~a^.
<pb n="20"/>
Vis.M. XI-XIII gives a detailed 
explanation of the 5 mundane higher 
powers, together with the method of 
attaining them.
In connection with the 4 kinds of 
progress (s. patipada^), abhin~n~a^ 
means the 'comprehension' achieved on 
attainment of the paths and fruitions.

<xa>abhisama^ca^rika si^la</xa>

, ... 
'morality consisting in good behaviour',
 
relates to the external duties of a monk
 such as towards his superior, etc. 
"abhisama^ca^rika si^la is a name for 
those moral rules other than the 8 
ending with right livelihood (i.e. 4-
fold right speech, 3-fold right action 
and right livelihood, as in the 
Eightfold Path) (Vis.M. I; s. sacca IV, 
3-5). 
"Impossible is it, o monks, that without

genuine pure conduct, he is morally 
strong, morally firm and trains himself 
in the moral rules taken upon himself. 
After overcoming the 3 fetters (ego-
belief. sceptic doubt and attachment to

<xa>a^ka^sa</xa>
  'space', ... 
'space', is, according to Com., of two 
kinds: 
limited space (paricchinna^ka^sa or 
pariccheda^ka^sa),  
endless space (ananta^ka^sa), i.e. 
cosmic space. 
1. Limited space, under the name of a^ka
^sa-dha^tu (space element), belongs to 
derived corporeality (s. khandha, 
Summary I; Dhs 638) and to a sixfold 
classification of elements (s. dha^tu; M
<pb n="32"/>
.112, M.115, M.140). It is also an 
object of kasina (q.v.) meditation. It 
is defined as follows: "The space 
element has the characteristic of 
delimiting matter. Its function is to 
indicate the boundaries of matter. It is
 manifested as the confines of matter; 
or its manifestation consists in being 
untouched (by the 4 great elements), and
 in holes and apertures. Its proximate 
cause is the matter delimited. It is on 
account of the space element that one 
can say of material things delimited 
that 'this is above. below, around that'
 " (Vis.M. XIV.63).
2. Endless space is called in Atthasa^
lini ajata^ka^sa, 'unentangled', i.e. 
unobstructed or empty space. It is the 
object of the first immaterial 
absorption (s. jha^na), the sphere of 
boundless space (a^ka^sa^nan~ca^yatana).
 According to Abhidhamma philosophy, 
endless space has no objective reality (
being purely conceptual), which is 
indicated by the fact that it is not 
included in the triad of the wholesome (
kusalatika), which comprises the entire 
reality. Later Buddhist schools have 
regarded it as one of several 
unconditioned or uncreated states (
<pb n="33"/>
asankhata dharma) - a view that is 
rejected in Kath. (s. Guide. p. 70). 
Therava^da Buddhism recognizes only 
Nibba^na as an unconditioned element (
asankhata-dha^tu: s. Dhs. 1084).

 'unshakable', ... 
'unshakable', is one who has attained 
full mastery over the absorptions (jha^
na, q.v.). 
In Pug. 4 it is said:
'What person is unshakable? If a person 
gains the meditative attainments of the 
fine-material and immaterial sphere (rú
pa^vacara-arúpa^vacara); and he gains 
them at his wish, without toil and 
exertion; and according to his wish, as 
regards place, object and duration, 
enters them or arises from them, then it
 is impossible that in such a person the
 attainments may become shaken through 
negligence. This person is unshakable."

unfavourable karma-results and contain 
the seeds of unhappy destiny or rebirth.

"A being, through the disappearing of

reappears in a higher world (amongst the
 devas of the Pure Abodes, suddha^va^sa,
 q.v.), and without returning from that

(1) "He may, immediately after appearing
 there (in the Pure Abodes) or without 
having gone beyond half of the life-time
, attain the holy path for the 
overcoming of the higher fetters. Such a
 being is called 'one who reaches Nibba^
na within the first half of the life' (
antara^-parinibba^yi^).
(2) "Or, whilst living beyond half of 
the lifetime, or at the moment of death,
 he attains the holy path for the 
overcoming of the higher fetters. Such a
 being is called 'one who reaches Nibba^
na after crossing half the life-time' (
upahacca-parinibba^yi^).
(3) "Or, with exertion he attains the 
holy path for the overcoming of the 
higher fetters. Such a being is called '
one who reaches Nibba^na with exertion'

(4) "Or, without exertion he attains the
 holy path for the overcoming of the 
higher fetters. Such a being is called '
one who reaches Nibba^na without 
exertion' (asankha^ra-parinibba^yi^).
(5) "Or, after vanishing from the heaven

which therefore is the cause of the 
immediately following consciousness as 
its result or 'fruition' (phala, q.v.). 
According to the Abhidhamma, the path (
of the Sota^panna, etc.) is generated by
<pb n="42"/>
 the insight into the impermanence, 
misery and impersonality of existence, 
flashing up at that very moment and 
transforming and ennobling one's nature 
forever.

In the Satipattha^na Sutta (M. 10, D. 22

are given, which may also serve as basis
 for insight meditation. The 'Discourse 
on Mindfulness of Breathing' (a^na^pa^
nasati Sutta, M. 118) and other texts 
have 16 methods of practice, which 
divide into 4 groups of four. The first 
three apply to both tranquillity (
samatha, q.v.) and insight-meditation, 
while the fourth refers to pure insight 
practice only. The second and the third 
group require the attainment of the 
absorptions.

In M. 118 it is further shown how these 
16 exercises bring about the 4 
foundations of mindfulness (satipattha^
na, q.v.), namely: 
1-4 contemplation of the body,  
5-8 contemplation of feeling,  
9-12 contemplation of mind (
consciousness),  
13-16 contemplation of mind-objects. 
 Then it is shown how these 4 
foundations of mindfulness bring about 
the 7 factors of enlightenment (
bojjhanga, q.v.); then these again 
deliverance of mind (ceto-vimutti, q.v.)
 and deliverance through wisdom (pan~n~a

<xa>anatta^</xa>
  'not-self', non-ego, egolessness, 
impersonality, ... 
is the last of the three characteristics
 of existence (ti-lakkhana, q.v.) The 
anatta^ doctrine teaches that neither 
within the bodily and mental phenomena 
of existence, nor outside of them, can 
be found anything that in the ultimate 
sense could be regarded as a self-
existing real ego-entity, soul or any 
other abiding substance. 
This is the central doctrine of Buddhism
, without understanding which a real 
knowledge of Buddhism is altogether 
impossible. It is the only really 
specific Buddhist doctrine, with which 
the entire Structure of the Buddhist 
teaching stands or falls. All the 
remaining Buddhist doctrines may, more 
or less, be found in other philosophic 
systems and religions, but the anatta^-
<pb n="47"/>
doctrine has been clearly and 
unreservedly taught only by the Buddha, 
wherefore the Buddha is known as the 
anatta^-va^di, or 'Teacher of 
Impersonality'. 
Whosoever has not penetrated this 
impersonality of all existence, and does
 not comprehend that in reality there 
exists only this continually self-
consuming process of arising and passing
 bodily and mental phenomena, and that 
there is no separate ego-entity within 
or without this process, he will not be 
able to understand Buddhism, i.e. the 
teaching of the 4 Noble Truths (sacca, q
.v.), in the right light. He will think 
that it is his ego, his personality, 
that experiences suffering, his 
personality that performs good and evil 
actions and will be reborn according to 
these actions, his personality that will
 enter into Nibba^na, his personality 
that walks on the Eightfold Path. Thus 
it is said in Vis.M. XVI:
 
"Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is 
found; 
The deeds are, but no doer of the deeds 
is there; 
Nibba^na is, but not the man that enters
<pb n="48"/>
 it; 
The path is, but no traveler on it is 
seen." 
 
"Whosoever is not clear with regard to 
the conditionally arisen phenomena, and 
does not comprehend that all the actions
 are conditioned through ignorance, etc.
, he thinks that it is an ego that 
understands or does not understand, that
 acts or causes to act, that comes to 
existence at rebirth .... that has the 
sense-impression, that feels, desires, 
becomes attached, continues and at 
rebirth again enters a new existence" (
Vis.M. XVII. 117).
While in the case of the first two 
characteristics it is stated that all 
formations (sabbe sankha^ra^) are 
impermanent and subject to suffering, 
the corresponding text for the third 
characteristic states that "all things 
are not-self" (sabbe dhamma^ anatta^; M.
 35, Dhp. 279). This is for emphasizing 
that the false view of an abiding self 
or substance is neither applicable to 
any 'formation' or conditioned 
phenomenon, nor to Nibba^na, the 
Unconditioned Element (asankhata^ dha^tu
).
<pb n="49"/>
The Anatta^-lakkhana Sutta, the '
Discourse on the Characteristic of Not-
self', was the second discourse after 
Enlightenment, preached by the Buddha to
 his first five disciples, who after 
hearing it attained to perfect Holiness 
(arahatta).
The contemplation of not-self (anatta^
nupassana^) leads to the emptiness 
liberation (sun~n~ata^-vimokkha, s. 
vimokkha). Herein the faculty of wisdom 
(pan~n~indriya) is outstanding, and one 
who attains in that way the path of 
Stream-entry is called a Dhamma-devotee 
(dhamma^nusa^ri; s. ariya-puggala); at 
the next two stages of sainthood he 
becomes a vision-attainer (ditthippatta)
; and at the highest stage, i.e. 
Holiness, he is called 'liberated by 
wisdom' (pan~n~a^-vimutta).

<xa>anicca</xa>
  'impermanent' (or, as abstract noun, 
aniccata^, 'impermanence') ... 
is the first of the three 
characteristics of existence (tilakkhana
, q.v.). It is from the fact of 
impermanence that, in most texts, the 
other two characteristics, suffering (
dukkha) and not-self (anatta^), are 
derived (S.22. 15; Ud.IV. I)
"Impermanence of things is the rising, 
passing and changing of things, or the 
disappearance of things that have become
 or arisen. The meaning is that these 
things never persist in the same way, 
but that they are vanishing dissolving 
from moment to moment" (Vis.M. VII, 3).
Impermanence is a basic feature of all 
conditioned phenomena, be they material 
or mental, coarse or subtle, one's own 
or external: All formations are 
impermanent" (sabbe sankha^ra^ anicca^; 
M. 35, Dhp. 277). That the totality of 
existence is impermanent is also often 
stated in terms of the five aggregates (
khandha, q.v.), the twelve personal and 
external sense bases (a^yatana q.v.), 
etc. Only Nibba^na (q.v.), which is 
unconditioned and not a formation (
asankhata), is permanent (nicca, dhuva).
<pb n="52"/>
The insight leading to the first stage 
of deliverance, Stream-entry (sota^patti
; s. ariya-puggala), is often expressed 
in terms of impermanence: "Whatever is 
subject to origination, is subject to 
cessation" (s. Dhammacakkappavattana 
Sutta, S.46. 11). In his last 
exhortation, before his Parinibba^na, 
the Buddha reminded his monks of the 
impermanence of existence as a spur to 
earnest effort: "Behold now, Bhikkhus, I
 exhort you: Formations are bound to 
vanish. Strive earnestly!" (vayadhamma^ 
sankha^ra^, appama^dena sampa^detha; D. 
16).
Without the deep insight into the 
impermanence and insubstantiality of all
 phenomena of existence there is no 
attainment of deliverance. Hence 
comprehension of impermanence gained by 
direct meditative experience heads two 
lists of insight knowledge: 
(a) contemplation of impermanence (
anicca^nupassana^) is the first of the 
18 chief kinds of insight (q.v.);  
(b) the contemplation of arising and 
vanishing (udayabbaya^nupassana^-n~a^na)
 is the first of 9 kinds of knowledge 
which lead to the 'purification by 
knowledge and vision of the path-
<pb n="53"/>
progress' (s. visuddhi, VI). -  
Contemplation of impermanence leads to 
the conditionless deliverance (animitta-
vimokkha; s. vimokkha). As herein the 
faculty of confidence (saddhindriya) is 
outstanding, he who attains in that way 
the path of Stream-entry is called a 
faith-devotee (saddha^nusa^ri^; s. ariya
-puggala) and at the seven higher stages
 he is called faith-liberated (saddha^-
vimutta), - See also anicca-san~n~a^.

<xa>anicca^nupassana^</xa>
  'contemplation of impermanence', is 
one of the 18 chief kinds of insight (s.
 vipassana^).

<xa>anicca san~n~a^</xa>
 'perception of impermanence', ... 
'perception of impermanence', is defined
 in the Girimananda Sutta (A.X. 60) as 
meditation on the impermanence of the 
five groups of existence.
"Though, with a faithful heart, one 
takes refuge in the Buddha, his Teaching
 and the Community of Monks; or with a 
faithful heart observes the rules of 
morality, or develops a mind full of 
<pb n="54"/>

 is if one cultivates the perception of 
impermanence, be it only for a moment" (
A.X. 20).

<xa>an~n~a^</xa>
  'highest knowledge', gnosis, refers to
 the perfect knowledge of the Saint (
Arahat; s. ariya-puggala). The following
 passage occurs frequently in the Suttas
, when a monk indicates his attainment 
of Holiness (arahatta): "He makes known 
highest knowledge (an~n~am vya^karoti), 
thus: 'Rebirth has ceased, fulfilled is 
the holy life, the task is accomplished,
<pb n="55"/>
 and there is no more of this to come.' 
"
The 'faculty of highest knowledge' (an~n
~' indriya = an~n~a^-indriya; s. indriya
), however, is present in six of the 
eight stages of holiness, that is, 
beginning with the fruition of Stream-
Winning (sota^patti-phala) up to the 
path of Holiness (arahatta-magga). See

immediately before either reaching the 
absorptions (jha^na, q.v.) or the 
supermundane paths (s. ariya-puggala). 
These 4 moments of impulsion are: the 
preparation (parikamma), access (upaca^

s. javana, gotrabhú.

<xa>anuloma n~a^na</xa>
 'adaptation-knowledge' or conformity-

- 7 fold: "The seven contemplation's: (1
) Contemplating (formations) as 
impermanent, one abandons the perception

<xa>anupubba nirodha</xa>
 The 9 'successive extinctions', are the
 8 extinctions reached through the 8 
absorptions (jha^na, q.v.) and the 
extinction of feeling and perception' (s
. nirodha-sama^patti), as it is said in 
A. IX, 31 and D. 33:
"In him who has entered the 1st 
<pb n="58"/>
absorption, the sensuous perceptions (ka
^ma-san~n~a^) are extinguished. Having 
entered the 2nd absorption, thought-
conception and discursive thinking (
vitakkavica^ra, q.v.) are extinguished. 
Having entered the 3rd absorption, 
rapture (pi^ti, q.v.) is extinguished. 
Having entered the 4th absorption, in-
and-out breathing (assa^sa-passa^sa, q.v
.) are extinguished. Having entered the 
sphere of boundless space (a^ka^sa^nan~
ca^yatana), the corporeality perceptions
 (rúpa-san~n~a^) are extinguished. 
Having entered the sphere of boundless 
consciousness (vin~n~a^nan~ca^yatana), 
the perception of the sphere of 
boundless space is extinguished. Having 
entered the sphere of nothingness (a^kin
~can~n~a^yatana), the perception of the 
sphere of boundless consciousness is 
extinguished. Having entered the sphere 
of neither-perception-nor-non-perception
 (neva-san~n~a^-na^san~n~a^yatana) the 
perception of the sphere of nothingness 
is extinguished. Having entered the 
extinction of perception and feeling (
san~n~a^vedayitanirodha) perception and 
feeling are extinguished." For further 
details, s. jha^na, nirodha-sama^patti.

<pb n="59"/>
<xa>anupubba viha^ra</xa>
 the 9 'successive abodes', are 
identical with the 9 anupubba-nirodha (s
. above). In A. IX, 33 they are called 
successive attainments (anupubba-sama^
patti).

<xa>a^nupubbi^ katha^</xa>
 'gradual instruction', progressive 
sermon; given by the Buddha when it was 
necessary to prepare first the listener'
s mind before speaking to him on the 
advanced teaching of the Four Noble 
Truths. The stock passage (e.g. D. 3; D 
14; M. 56) runs as follows:
"Then the Blessed One gave him a gradual
 instruction - that is to say, he spoke 
on liberality ('giving', da^na, q.v.), 
on moral conduct (si^la) and on the 
heaven (sagga); he explained the peril, 
the vanity and the depravity of sensual 
pleasures, and the advantage
of renunciation. When the Blessed One 
perceived that the listener's mind was 
prepared, pliant, free from obstacles, 
elevated and lucid; then he explained to
 him that exalted teaching particular to
 the Buddhas (buddha^nam sa^mukkamsika^ 
desana^), that is: suffering, its cause,
 its ceasing, and the path."
<pb n="60"/>

<xa>anurakkhana padha^na</xa>
 the 'effort to maintain' wholesome 
states; s. padha^na.

<xa>anusaya</xa>
  the 7 'proclivities', inclinations, or
 tendencies are: sensuous greed (ka^ma-
ra^ga, s. samyojana), grudge (patigha), 
speculative opinion (ditthi, q.v.), 
sceptical doubt (vicikiccha^, q.v.), 
conceit (ma^na, q.v.), craving for 
continued existence (bhavara^ga), 
ignorance (avijja^, q.v.) (D. 33; A. VII
, 11, 12).
"These things are called 'proclivities' 
since, in consequence of their 
pertinacity, they ever and again tend to
 become the conditions for the arising 
of ever new sensuous greed, etc.'' (Vis.
M. XXII, 60).
Yam. VII, first determines in which 
beings such and such proclivities exist,
 and which proclivities, and with regard
 to what, and in which sphere of 
existence. Thereafter it gives an 
explanation concerning their overcoming,
 their penetration, etc. Cf. Guide VI (
vii). According to Kath. several ancient
 Buddhist schools erroneously held the 
<pb n="61"/>
opinion that the anusayas, as such, 
meant merely latent, hence karmically 
neutral qualities, which however 
Contradicts the Therava^da conception. 
Cf. Guide V, 88, 108, 139.

<xa>anussati</xa>
  'recollection', meditation, 
contemplation. The six recollections 
often described in the Suttas (e.g. A. 
VI, 10, 25; D. 33) are: (1) recollection
 of the Buddha, (2) his Doctrine, (3) 
his Community of noble disciples, (4) of
 morality, (5) liberality, (6) heavenly 
beings (buddha^nussati, dhamma^nussati, 
sangha^nussati, si^la^nussati, ca^ga^
nussati, devata^nussati).
(1) "The noble disciple, Maha^na^ma, 
recollects thus: 'This Blessed One is 
holy, a fully Enlightened One, perfected
 in wisdom and conduct, faring happily, 
knower of the worlds, unsurpassed leader
 of men to be trained, teacher of 
heavenly beings and men, a Buddha, a 
Blessed One.'
(2) 'Well proclaimed by the Blessed One 
is the Doctrine (dhamma), directly 
visible, with immediate fruit, inviting 
investigation, leading on to Nibba^na, 
to be comprehended by the wise, each by 
<pb n="62"/>
himself.'
(3) 'Of good conduct is the Community (
Sangha) of the Blessed One's disciples, 
of upright conduct, living on the right 
path, performing their duties, to wit: 
the 4 pairs of men or 8 individuals (s. 
ariya puggala). This Community of the 
Blessed One's disciples is worthy of 
offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy
 of gifts, worthy of reverence with 
raised hands, the unsurpassed field for 
doing meritorious deeds.'
(4) "The noble disciple further 
recollects his own morality (si^la) 
which is unbroken, without any breach, 
undefiled, untarnished, conducive to 
liberation, praised by the wise, not 
dependent (on craving or opinions), 
leading to concentration.
(5) "The noble disciple further 
recollects his own liberality (ca^ga) 
thus: 'Blessed truly am I, highly 
blessed am I who, amongst beings defiled
 with the filth of stinginess, live with
 heart free from stinginess, liberal, 
open-handed, rejoicing in giving, ready 
to give anything asked for, glad to give
 and share with others.'
(6) "The noble disciple further 
recollects the heavenly beings (devata^)
<pb n="63"/>
: 'There are the heavenly beings of the 
retinue of the Four Great Kings, the 
heavenly beings of the World of the 
Thirty-Three, the Ya^madevas ... and 
there are heavenly beings besides (s. 
deva). Such faith, such morality, such 
knowledge, such liberality, such insight
, possessed of which those heavenly 
beings, after vanishing from here, are 
reborn in those worlds, such things are 
also found in me.' " (A. III,70; VI,10; 
XI,12).
"At the time when the noble disciple 
recollects the Perfect One ... at such a
 time his mind is neither possessed of 
greed, nor of hate, nor of delusion. 
Quite upright at such a time is his mind
 owing to the Perfect One ... With 
upright mind the noble disciple attains 
understanding of the sense, 
understanding of the law, attains joy 
through the law. In the joyous one 
rapture arises. With heart enraptured, 
his whole being becomes stilled. Stilled
 within his being, he feels happiness; 
and the mind of the happy one becomes 
firm. Of this noble disciple it is said 
that amongst those gone astray, he walks
 on the right path, among those 
suffering he abides free from suffering.
<pb n="64"/>
 Thus having reached the stream of the 
law, he develops the recollection of the
 Enlightened One...." (A. VI, 10).
In A. I, 21 (PTS: I, xvi) and A. I, 27 (
PTS: xx. 2) another 4 recollections are 
added: mindfulness on death (marana-sati
, q.v.), on the body (ka^yagata^-.sati, 
q.v.), on breathing (a^na^pa^na-sati, q.
v.), and the recollection of peace (
upasama^nussati, q.v.).
The first six recollections are fully 
explained in Vis.M. VII, the latter four
 in Vis.M. VIII.

(A) The 8 ,a. are those who have 
realized one of the 8 stages of holiness
, i.e. the 4 supermundane paths (magga) 
and the 4 supermundane fruitions (phala)
 of these paths. There are 4 pairs:
1. The one realizing the path of Stream-
winning (sota^pattimagga).
2. The one realizing the fruition of 
Stream-winning (sota^pattiphala).
3. The one realizing the path of Once-
return (sakada^ga^miphala).
4. The one realizing the fruition of 
Once-return (sakada^ga^miphala).
5. The one realizing the path of Non-
return (ana^ga^mimagga).
6. The one realizing the fruition of Non
-return (ana^ga^miphala).
7. The one realizing the path of 
Holiness (arahatta-magga).
8. The one realizing the fruition of 
Holiness (arahatta-phala).
Summed up, there are 4 noble individuals
 (ariya-puggala): the Stream-winner (
Sota^panna), the Once-Returner (Sakada^
<pb n="70"/>
ga^mi), the Non-Returner (Ana^ga^mi^), 
the Holy One (Arahat).
In A. VIII,10 and A. IX, 16 the gotrabhú
 (q.v.) is listed as the 9th noble 
individual.
According to the Abhidhamma, '
supermundane path', or simply 'path' (
magga), is a designation of the moment 
of entering into one of the 4 stages of 
holiness - Nibba^na being the object - 
produced by intuitional insight (
vipassana^) into the impermanence, 
misery and impersonality of existence, 
flashing forth and forever transforming 
one's life and nature. By 'fruition' (
phala) is meant those moments of 
consciousness which follow immediately 
thereafter as the result of the path, 
and which in certain circumstances may 
repeat for innumerable times during the 
life-time.
(I) Through the path of Stream-winning (
sota^patti-magga) one 'becomes' free (
whereas in realizing the fruition, one '
is' free) from the first 3 fetters (
samyojana, q.v.) which bind beings to 
existence in the sensuous sphere, to wit
: (1) personality-belief (sakka^ya-
ditthi; s. ditthi), (2) skeptical doubt 
(vicikiccha^, q.v.), (3) attachment to 
<pb n="71"/>
mere rules and rituals (si^labbata-para^
ma^sa; s. upa^da^na).
(II) Through the path of Once-return (
sakada^ga^mi-magga) one becomes nearly 
free from the 4th and 5th fetters, to 
wit: (4) sensuous craving (ka^ma-cchanda
 = ka^ma-ra^ga; s. ra^ga), (5) ill-will 
(vya^pa^da = dosa, s. múla).
(III) Through the path of Non-return (
ana^ga^mi-magga) one becomes fully free 
from the above-mentioned 5 lower fetters
.
(IV) Through the path of Holiness (
arahatta-magga) one further becomes free
 from the 5 higher fetters, to wit: (6) 
craving for fine material existence (rú
pa-ra^ga), (7) craving for immaterial 
existence. (arúpa-ra^ga), (8) conceit (
ma^na, q.v.), (9) restlessness (uddhacca
, q.v.), (10) ignorance (avijja^, q.v.).
The stereotype Sutta text runs as 
follows:
(I) "After the disappearance of the 
three fetters, the monk has won the 
stream (to Nibba^na) and is no more 
subject to rebirth in lower worlds, is 
firmly established, destined for full 
enlightenment.
(II) "After the disappearance of the 
three fetters and reduction of greed, 
<pb n="72"/>
hatred and delusion, he will return only
 once more; and having once more 
returned to this world, he will put an 
end to suffering.
(III) "After the disappearance of the 
five fetters he appears in a higher 
world, and there he reaches Nibba^na 
without ever returning from that world (
to the sensuous sphere).
(IV) "Through the extinction of all 
cankers (a^sava-kkhaya) he reaches 
already in this very life the 
deliverance of mind, the deliverance 
through wisdom, which is free from 
cankers, and which he himself has 
understood and realized."
For the various classes of Stream-
winners and Non-Returners, s. Sota^panna
, Ana^ga^mi^.
(B) The sevenfold grouping of the noble 
disciples is as follows:
(1) the faith-devotee (saddha^nusa^ri^),
 (2) the faith-liberated one (saddha^
vimutta), (3) the body-witness (ka^ya-
sakkhi^), (4) the both-ways-liberated 
one (ubhato-bha^ga-vimutta), (5) the 
Dhamma-devotee (dhamma^nusa^ri^), (6) 
the vision-attainer (ditthippatta), (7) 
the wisdom-liberated one (pan~n~a^-
vimutta). This group of seven noble 
<pb n="73"/>
disciples is thus explained in Vis.M. 
XXI, 73:
(1) "He who is filled with resolution (
adhimokkha) and, in considering the 
formations as impermanent (anicca), 
gains the faculty of faith, he, at the 
moment of the path to Stream-winning (A.
1) is called a faith-devotee (saddha^

<xa>ariya sacca</xa>
 The Four 'Noble Truths'; s. sacca.

<xa>ariya vamsa</xa>
 The four 'noble usage's', are: 
contentedness (of the monk) with any 
robe, contentedness with any alms-food, 
contentedness with any dwelling, and 
delight in meditation and detachment. In
 the Ariya-vamsa Sutta, (A. IV , 28) and
 similarly in D. 33, it is said :
"Now the monk is contented with any robe
, with any alms-food, with any dwelling,
 finds pleasure and enjoyment in mental 
training and detachment . But neither is
 he haughty on that account, nor does he
 look down upon others. Now, of a monk 
who herein is fit and indefatigable, who
 remains clearly conscious and mindful, 
of such a monk it is said that he is 
firmly established in the ancient, noble
 usage's known as the most lofty ones."

 an Abhidhamma term signifying a 'state

<xa>a^sava</xa>
  (lit: influxes), 'cankers', taints, 
corruption's, intoxicant biases. There 
is a list of four (as in D. 16, Pts.M., 
Vibh.): the canker of sense-desire (ka^
ma^sava), of (desiring eternal) 
existence (bhava^sava), of (wrong) views
 (dittha^sava), and of ignorance (avijja
^sava). A list of three, omitting the 
canker of views, is possibly older and 
is more frequent in the Suttas, e.g. in 
M. 2, M. 9, D. 33; A. III, 59, 67; A. VI
, 63. - In Vibh. (Khuddakavatthu Vibh.) 
both the 3-fold and 4-fold division are 
mentioned. The fourfold division also 
occurs under the name of 'floods' (ogha)
 and 'yokes' (yoga).
Through the path of Stream-Entry, the 
canker of views is destroyed; through 
the path of Non-Returning, the canker of
 sense-desire; through the path of 
Arahatship, the cankers of existence and
 ignorance. M. 2 shows how to overcome 
the cankers, namely, through insight, 
sense-control, avoidance, wise use of 
the necessities of life, etc. For a 
commentarial exposition, see Atthasa^
lini Tr. I, p. 63f: II, pp. 475ff.
Khi^na^sava, 'one whose cankers are 
destroyed', or 'one who is canker-free',
<pb n="78"/>
 is a name for the Arahat or Holy One. 
The state of Arahatship is frequently 
called a^savakkhaya, 'the destruction of
 the cankers'. Suttas concluding with 
the attainment of Arahatship by the 
listeners, often end with the words: "
During this utterance, the hearts of the
 Bhikkhus were freed from the cankers 
through clinging no more" (anupa^da^ya a
^savehi citta^ni vimuccimsú'ti).

name for the Arahat, the Holy One (s. 
ariya-puggala), since he has reached the
 perfection in higher moral training, 
higher mind training and higher wisdom 
training (s. sikkha^) and needs no 
longer to train himself therein.

<xa>a^sevana paccaya</xa>
 'repetition', is one of the 24 
conditions (paccaya, q.v.).

<xa>asmi ma^na</xa>
 (lit.: 'I am'-conceit), 'ego-conceit', 
may range from the coarsest pride and 
self-assertion to a subtle feeling of 
one's distinctiveness or superiority 
that persists, as the 8th fetter (
samyojana, q.v.), until the attainment 
of Arahatship or Holiness. It is based 
upon the comparison of oneself with 
others, and may, therefore, manifest 
itself also as a feeling of inferiority 
or the claim to be equal (s. ma^na). It 
has to be distinguished from 'ego-belief
' (sakka^ya-ditthi, q.v.) which implies 
a definite belief or view (ditthi) 
concerning the assumption of a self or 
soul, and, being the 1st of the fetters,
 disappears at attainment of Stream-
Entry (sota^patti; s. ariya-puggala).
"Even when the five lower fetters have 
vanished in a noble disciple, there is 
still in him, with regard to the five 
groups of clinging, a slight undiscarded
 measure of the conceit 'I am', of the 
will 'I am', of the proclivity 'I am' "

are called 'meditation-subjects of 
impurity' (asubha-kammattha^na; s. bha^

 50), however, the perception of 
impurity (asubha-san~n~a^) refers to the
 contemplation of the 32 parts of the 
body (s. ka^ya-gata^-sati). The 
contemplation of the body's impurity is 
an antidote against the hindrance of 
sense-desire (s. ni^varana) and the 
mental perversion (vipalla^sa, q.v.) 
<pb n="81"/>
which sees what is truly impure as pure 
and beautiful. See S. XLVI, 51; A. V. 36

 one of the three constituents of right 
thought (samma^-sankappa), i.e. the 2nd 
factor of the Eightfold Path (s. magga).
 In the several lists of 'elements' (dha

harmlessness' (avihesa^-dha^tu), in the 
sense of an elementary quality of noble 
thought. See Dhp. 225, 261, 270, 300.

<xa>avijja^</xa>
  'ignorance,' nescience, unknowing; 
synonymous with delusion (moha, s. múla)
, is the primary root of all evil and 
suffering in the world, veiling man's 
<pb n="87"/>
mental eyes and preventing him from 
seeing the true nature of things. It is 
the delusion tricking beings by making 
life appear to them as permanent, happy,
 substantial and beautiful and 
preventing them from seeing that 
everything in reality is impermanent, 
liable to suffering, void of 'I' and '
mine', and basically impure (s. vipalla^
sa). Ignorance is defined as 'not 
knowing the four truths, namely, 
suffering, its origin, its cessation, 
and the way to its cessation' (S. XII, 4
).
As ignorance is the foundation of all 
life-affirming actions, of all evil and 
suffering, therefore it stands first in 
the formula of Dependent Origination (
paticca-samuppa^da, q.v.). But for that 
reason, says Vis.M. (XVII, 36f) 
ignorance should not be regarded as "the
 causeless root-cause of the world ... 
It is not causeless. For a cause of it 
is stated thus 'With the arising of 
cankers (a^sava, q.v.) there is the 
arising of ignorance' (M. 9). But there 
is a figurative way in which it can be 
treated as a root-cause; namely, when it
 is made to serve as a starting point in
 an exposition of the Round of Existence
<pb n="88"/>
 ... As it is said: 'No first beginning 
of ignorance can be perceived, Bhikkhus,
 before which ignorance was not, and 
after which it came to be. But it can be
 perceived that ignorance has its 
specific condition (idappaccaya)" (A. X,
 61). The same statement is made (A. X, 
62) about the craving for existence (
bhava-tanha^; s. tanha^). The latter and
 ignorance are called "the outstanding 
causes of kamma that lead to unhappy and
 happy destinies" (Vis.M. XVII, 38).
As ignorance still exists - though in a 
very refined way until the attainment of
 Arahatship or Holiness, it is counted 
as the last of the 10 fetters (samyojana
, q.v.) which bind beings to the cycle 
of rebirths. As the first two roots of 
evil, greed and hate (s. múla), are on 
their part rooted in ignorance, 
consequently all unwholesome states of 
mind are inseparably bound up with it. 
Ignorance (or delusion) is the most 
obstinate of the three roots of evil.
Ignorance is one of the cankers (a^sava,
 q.v.) and proclivities (anusaya, q.v.).
 It is often called a hindrance (ni^
varana; e.g. in S.XV, 3; A.X, 61) but 
does not appear together with the usual 
list of five hindrances.
<pb n="89"/>

<xa>avikkhepa</xa>
  'undistractedness', is a synonym of 
concentration (sama^dhi, q.v.), one-
pointedness of mind (citt'ekaggata^) and
 tranquillity (samatha, q.v.; further s.
 samatha-vipassana^).

  lit. 'indeterminate' - i.e. neither

 2. The 12 'bases' or 'sources' on which
 depend the mental processes, consist of
 five physical sense-organs and 
consciousness, being the six personal (
ajjhattika) bases; and the six objects, 
the so-called external (ba^hira) bases -
 namely:
eye, or visual organ visible object
ear, or auditory organ sound, or audible
 object
nose, or olfactory organ odour, or 
olfactive object
tongue, or gustatory organ taste, or 
gustative object
body, or tactile organ body-impression, 
or tactile object
mind-base, or consciousness mind-object
(mana^yatana) (dhamma^yatana)
<pb n="91"/>
 
"By the visual organ (cakkha^yatana) is 
meant the sensitive part of the eye (
cakkhu-pasa^da) built up of the four 
elements ... responding to sense-stimuli
" (sa-ppatigha).... (Vibh. II). Similar 
is the explanation of the four remaining
 physical sense-organs.
Mind-base (mana^yatana) is a collective 
term for all consciousness whatever, and
 should therefore not be confounded with
 the mind-element (mano-dha^tu; s. dha^
tu II, 16), which latter performs only 
the functions of adverting (a^vajjana) 
to the sense-object, and of receiving (
sampaticchana) the sense-object. On the 
functions of the mind, s. vin~n~a^na-
kicca.
The visible object (rúpa^yatana) is 
described in Vibh. II as "that 
phenomenon which is built up of the four
 physical elements and appears as color,
 etc." What is' seen by-visual 
perception, i.e. by eye-consciousness (
cakkhu-vin~n~a^na) are colors and 
differences of light, but not three 
dimensional bodily things.
'Mind-object-base' (dhamma^yatana) is 
identical with 'mind-object-element' (
dhamma-dha^tu; s. dha^tu II) and dhamma^
<pb n="92"/>
rammana (s. a^rammana). It may be 
physical or mental, past, present or 
future, real or imaginary.
The 5 physical sense-organs are also 
called faculties (indriya, q.v.), and of
 these faculties it is said in M. 43: "
Each of the five faculties owns a 
different sphere, and none of them 
partakes of the sphere of another one; .
.. they have mind as their support... 
are conditioned by vitality, ... but 
vitality again is conditioned by heat, 
heat again by vitality, just as the 
light and flame of a burning lamp are 
mutually conditioned."
The 12 bases are fully discussed in Vis.
M. XV. In Yam III (s Guide, p 98f) the 
12 terms are subjected to a logical 
investigation The six personal bases 
form the 5th link of dependent 
origination (paticca-samuppa^da 5, q.v.)
.

<xa>a^yúhana</xa>
  (karmic) 'accumulation', is a name 
used in the commentarial literature for 
the wholesome and unwholesome volitional
 activities (karma, q.v.) or karma-
formations (sankha^ra; s. paticca-
samuppa^da), being the bases of future 
<pb n="93"/>
rebirth. " 'Accumulation', is a name for
 the karma-formations, and signifies 
those volitions (cetana^) which arise at
 the performance of a karma, first while
 thinking 'I will give alms', and then 
while actually giving alms (e.g.) for 
one month or a year. The volition, 
however, at the time when one is handing
 the alms over to the recipient; is 
called karma-process (kamma-bhava, s. 
Vis.M. XVII, IX, X). Or, the volitions 
during the first six impulsive-moments (
javana, q.v.) depending on one and the 
same state of advertence (a^vajjana, s. 
vin~n~a^na-kicca), these are called the 
karma-formations, whilst the 7th 
impulsive moment is called the karma-
process (kamma-bhava).... Or, each 
volition is called 'karma-process' and 
the accumulation connected with it, '
karma-formation'. " (Vis.M. XVII). Cf. 
paticca-samuppa^da (2, 10) - (App.).

<xa>bahula kamma</xa>
 'habitual karma': s. karma.

<xa>bala</xa>
  'powers'. Among various groups of 
powers the following five are most 
frequently met with in the texts: (1) 
<pb n="94"/>
faith (saddha^, q.v.), (2) energy (
viriya, q.v.), (3) mindfulness (sati, q.
v.), (4) concentration (sama^dhi, q.v.),
 (5) wisdom (pan~n~a^, q.v.).
Their particular aspect, distinguishing 
them from the corresponding 5 spiritual 
faculties (indriya, q.v.), is that they 
are unshakable by their opposites: (1) 
the power of faith is unshakable by 
faithlessness (unbelief); (2) energy, by
 laziness; (3) mindfulness, by 
forgetfulness; (4) concentration, by 
distractedness; (5) wisdom, by ignorance
 (see Pts.M., n~a^na Katha^). They 
represent, therefore, the aspect of 
firmness in the spiritual faculties.
According to A.V. 15, the power (1) 
becomes manifest in the 4 qualities of 
the Stream-winner (sota^pannassa anga^ni
, q.v.), (2) in the 4 right efforts (s. 
padha^na), (3) in the 4 foundations of 
mindfulness (satipattha^na, q.v.), (4) 
in the 4 absorptions (jha^na, q.v.), (5)

Noble Truths (sacca, q.v.) .

 'knowledge consisting in contemplation 
of dissolution' (of all forms of 
existence), is one kind of insight: s. 
visuddhi (VI, 2).

<xa>bhava</xa>
  'becoming', 'process of existence', 
consists of 3 planes: sensuous existence
 (ka^ma-bhava), fine-material existence 
(rúpa-bhava), immaterial existence (arú
pa-bhava). Cf. loka.
The whole process of existence may be 
divided into two aspects:
(1) Karma-process (kamma-bhava), i.e. 
the karmically active side of existence,
 being the cause of rebirth and 
consisting in wholesome and unwholesome 
volitional actions. See Karma, paticca-
samuppa^da (IX).
(2) Karma-produced rebirth, or 
regenerating process (uppattibhava), i.e
<pb n="97"/>
. the karmically passive side of 
existence consisting in the arising and 
developing of the karma-produced and 
therefore morally neutral mental and 
bodily phenomena of existence. Cf. Tab. 
- (App.).

<xa>bha^va</xa>
  (feminine and masculine) 'nature', 
refers to the sexual characteristics of 
the body, and belongs to the group of 
corporeality (s. khandha). It is a

femininity and masculinity (s. indriya 7
, 8). (App.).

<xa>bhava ditthi</xa>
 'belief in being' (eternal personality)
; s. sassataditthi, ditthi.

<xa>bha^vana^</xa>
  'mental development' (lit. 'calling 
into existence, producing') is what in 
English is generally but rather vaguely 
called 'meditation'. One has to 
distinguish 2 kinds: development of 
tranquillity (samatha-bha^vana^), i.e. 
concentration (sama^dhi), and 
development of insight (vipassana^-bha^
vana^), i.e. wisdom (pan~n~a^).
<pb n="98"/>
These two important terms, tranquillity 
and insight (s. samatha-vipassana^), are
 very often met with and explained in 
the Sutta, as well as in the Abhidhamma.
Tranquillity (samatha) is the 
concentrated, unshaken, peaceful, and 
therefore undefiled state of mind, 
whilst insight (vipassana^) is the 
intuitive insight into the impermanence,
 misery and impersonality (anicca, 
dukkha, anatta^; s. tilakkhana) of all 
bodily and mental phenomena of existence
, included in the 5 groups of existence,
 namely, corporeality, feeling, 
perception, mental formations and 
consciousness; s. khandha.
Tranquillity, or concentration of mind, 
according to Sankhepavannana (Commentary
 to Abhidhammattha-sangaha), bestows a 
threefold blessing: favourable rebirth, 
present happy life, and purity of mind 
which is the condition of insight. 
Concentration (sama^dhi) is the 
indispensable foundation and 
precondition of insight by purifying the
 mind from the 5 mental defilements or 
hindrances (ni^varana, q.v.), whilst 
insight (vipassana^) produces the 4 
supra mundane stages of holiness and 
deliverance of mind. The Buddha 
<pb n="99"/>
therefore says: "May you develop mental 
concentration, o monks; for who is 
mentally concentrated, sees things 
according to reality" (S. XXII, 5). And 
in Mil. it is said: "Just as when a 
lighted lamp is brought into a dark 
chamber, the lamp-light Will destroy the
 darkness and produce and spread the 
light, just so will insight, once arisen
, destroy the darkness of ignorance and 
produce the light of knowledge."
Vis.M. III-XI gives full directions how 
to attain full concentration and the 
absorptions (jha^na, q.v.) by means of 
the following 40 meditation subjects (
kammattha^na):
10 kasina-exercises (s. kasina). These 
produce the 4 absorptions
10 loathsome subjects (asubha, q.v.). 
These produce the 1st absorption.
10 recollections (anussati, q.v.): of 
the Buddha (buddha^nussati), the 
Doctrine (dhamma^nussati), the 
Brotherhood of the Noble Ones (sangha^
nussati), morality, liberality, the 
heavenly beings, death (maranasati, q.v.
 ), the body (ka^yagata^sati, q.v.), in-
and-outbreathing (a^na^pa^na-sati, q.v.)
 and peace (upasama^nussati, q.v.). 
Among these, the recollection (or 
<pb n="100"/>
mindfulness) of in-and-out breathing may
 produce all the 4 absorptions, that of 
the body the 1st absorption, the rest 
only neighbourhood-concentration (upaca^
ra-sama^dhi, s. sama^dhi).
4 sublime abodes (brahma-viha^ra, q.v.):
 loving-kindness, compassion, altruistic
 joy, equanimity (metta^, karuna^, 
mudita^, upekkha^). Of these, the first 
3 exercises may produce 3 absorptions, 
the last one the 4th absorption only.
4 immaterial spheres (arúpa^yatana, s. 
jha^na): of unbounded space, unbounded 
consciousness, nothingness, neither-
perception-nor-non-perception. These are
 based upon the 4th absorption.
1 perception of the loathsomeness of 
food (a^ha^re patikkúla-san~n~a^), which
 may produce neighbourhood-concentration
1 analysis of the 4 elements (catudha^tu
-vavattha^na, s. dha^tu-vavattha^na), 
which may produce neighbourhood-
concentration.
Mental development forms one of the 3 
kinds of meritorious action (pun~n~a-
kiriya-vatthu, q.v.). 'Delight in 
meditation' (bha^vana^-ra^mata^) is one 
of the noble usages (ariya-vamsa, q.v.) 
.

<xa>bhavanga santa^na</xa>

<xa>bhavanga</xa>
 sota and bhavanga citta: The first term
 may tentatively be rendered as the '
undercurrent forming the condition of 
being, or existence', and the second as 
'subconsciousness', though, as will be 
evident from the following, it differs 
in several respects from the usage of 
that term in Western psychology. 
Bhavanga (bhava-anga), which, in the 
canonical works, is mentioned twice or 
thrice in the Pattha^na, is explained in
 the Abhidhamma commentaries as the 
foundation or condition (ka^rana) of 
existence (bhava), as the sine qua non 
of life, having the nature of a process,
 lit. a flux or stream (sota). Herein, 
since time immemorial, all impressions 
and experiences are, as it were, stored 
<pb n="102"/>
up, or better said, are functioning, but
 concealed as such to- full 
consciousness, from where however they 
occasionally emerge as subconscious 
phenomena and approach the threshold of 
full consciousness, or crossing it 
become fully conscious. This so-called '
subconscious life-stream' or 
undercurrent of life is that by which 
might be explained the faculty of memory
, paranormal psychic phenomena, mental 
and physical growth, karma and rebirth. 
etc. An alternative rendering is 'life-
continuum'.
It should be noted that bhavanga-citta 
is a karma-resultant state of 
consciousness (vipa^ka, q.v.), and that,
 in birth as a human or in higher forms 
of existence, it is always the result of
 good, or wholesome karma (kusala-kamma-
vipa^ka), though in varying degrees of 
strength (s. patisandhi, end of the 
article). The same holds true for 
rebirth consciousness (patisandhi) and 
death consciousness (cuti), which are 
only particular manifestations of 
subconsciousness. In Vis.M. XIV it is 
said:
"As soon as rebirth-consciousness (in 
the embryo at the time of conception) 
<pb n="103"/>
has ceased, there arises a similar 
subconsciousness with exactly the same 
object, following immediately upon 
rebirth-consciousness and being the 
result of this or that karma (volitional
 action done in a former birth and 
remembered there at the moment before 
death). And again a further similar 
state of subconsciousness arises. Now, 
as long as no other consciousness arises
 to interrupt the continuity of the life
-stream, so long the life-stream, like 
the flow of a river, rises in the same 
way again and again, even during 
dreamless sleep and at other times. In 
this way one has to understand the 
continuous arising of those states of 
consciousness in the life-stream." Cf. 
vin~n~a^na-kicca. For more details, s. 
Fund. 11. (App.).

<xa>bhikkhu</xa>
  A fully ordained disciple of the 
Buddha is called a bhikkhu. "Mendicant 
monk" may be suggested as the closest 
equivalent for "Bhikkhu", literally it 
means "he who begs" but bhikkhus do not 
beg. They silently stand at the door for
 alms. They live on what is 
spontaneously given by the supporters. 
He is not a priest as he is no mediator 
between God and man. He has no vows for 
life, but he is bound by his rules which
 he takes of his own accord. He leads a 
life of voluntary poverty and celibacy. 
If he is unable to live the Holy Life, 
he can discard the robe at any time.

holy life, knowing: 'In this way I shall
 dispel the former pain (of hunger, etc.
) and no new pain shall I let arise, and
 long life, blamelessness and ease will 
be my share ' This, o monks, is knowing 
the measure in eating." (A. III. 16). "
How o monks, would it be possible for 
Nanda to lead the absolutely pure life 
of holiness, if he did not watch over 
his senses and did not know the measure 
in eating?" (A. VII, 9).

 (from verbal root budhi, to awaken, to

awakens from the slumber or stupor (
inflicted upon the mind) by the 
defilements (kilesa, q.v.) and 
comprehends the Four Noble Truths (sacca
, q.v.)" (Com. to M. 10).
The enlightenment of a Buddha is called 
samma^-sambodhi (q.v.) 'perfect 
<pb n="106"/>
enlightenment'. The faith (saddha^, q.v.
) of a lay follower of the Buddha is 
described as "he believes in the 
enlightenment of the Perfect One" (
saddahati Tatha^gatassa bodhim: M. 53, A
. III, 2).
As components of the state of 
enlightenment and contributory factors 
to its achievement, are mentioned in the
 texts: the 7 factors of enlightenment (
bojjhanga (q.v.)= bodhi-anga) and the 37
 'things pertaining to enlightenment' (
bodhipakkhiya-dhamma^, q.v.). In one of 
the later books of the Sutta-Pitaka, the
 Buddhavamsa, 10 bodhipa^cana-dhamma^ 
are mentioned, i.e. qualities that lead 
to the ripening of perfect enlightenment
; these are the 10 perfections (pa^rami^
, q.v.).
There is a threefold classification of 
enlightenment: 1. that of a noble 
disciple (sa^vaka-bodhi, q.v.). i.e. of 
an Arahat, 2. of an Independently 
Enlightened One (pacceka-bodhi, q.v.), 
and 3. of a Perfect Enlightened One (
samma^-sambodhi). This 3-fold division, 
however, is of later origin, and in this
 form it neither occurs in the canonical
 texts nor in the older Sutta 
commentaries. The closest approximation 
<pb n="107"/>
to it is found in a verse sutta which is
 probably of a comparatively later 
period, the Treasure Store Sutta (
Nidhikkanda Sutta) of the Khuddakapa^tha
, where the following 3 terms are 
mentioned in stanza 15: sa^vaka-pa^rami^
, pacceka-bodhi, buddha-bhúmi (see Khp. 
Tr., pp. 247f.).
The commentaries (e.g. to M., 
Buddhavamsa, Cariyapitaka) generally 
give a 4-fold explanation of the word 
bodhi: 1. the tree of enlightenment, 2. 
the holy path (ariya-magga), 3. Nibba^na
, 4 omniscience (of the Buddha: sabban~n
~uta^-n~a^na). As to (2), the 
commentaries quote Cula-Nidesa where 
bodhi is defined as the knowledge 
relating to the 4 paths (of Stream-entry
, etc.; catúsu maggesu n~a^na).
Neither in the canonical texts nor in 
the old commentaries is it stated that a
 follower of the Buddha may choose 
between the three kinds of enlightenment
 and aspire either to become a Buddha, a
 Pacceka-Buddha, or an Arahat-disciple. 
This conception of a choice between 
three aspirations is, however, 
frequently found in present-day Therava^
da countries, e.g. in Sri Lanka.

<pb n="108"/>
<xa>bodhipakkhiya dhamma^</xa>
 The 37 'things pertaining to 
enlightenment', or 'requisites of 
enlightenment' comprise the entire 
doctrines of the Buddha. They are:
the 4 foundations of mindfulness (
satipattha^na, q.v.),
the 4 right efforts (s. padha^na),
the 4 roads to power (iddhi-pa^da, q.v.)
,
the 5 spiritual faculties (indriya; s. 
bala),
the 5 spiritual powers (bala, q.v.),
the 7 factors of enlightenment (
bojjhanga, q.v.),
the Noble 8-fold Path (s. magga).
In M. 77 all the 37 bodhipakkhiya-dhamma
^ are enumerated and explained though 
not called by that name. A detailed 
explanation of them is given in Vis.M. 
XXII. In S.XLVII, 51, 67, only the five 
spiritual faculties (indriya) are called
 bodhipakkhiya-dhamma^; and in the Jha^
na Vibhanga, only the 7 factors of 
enlightenment (bojjhanga).
See The Requisites of Enlightenment, by 
Ledi Sayadaw (WHEEL 169/172).

<xa>Bodhisatta</xa>
  'Enlightenment Being', is a being 
<pb n="109"/>
destined to Buddhahood, a future Buddha.
 According to the traditional belief a 
Bodhisatta, before reaching his last 
birth as a Buddha on this earth, is 
living in the Tusita-heaven (s. deva), 
the heaven of bliss. Cf. A. IV, 127; 
VIII, 70.
In the Pa^li Canon and commentaries, the
 designation 'Bodhisatta' is given only 
to Prince Siddhattha before his 
enlightenment and to his former 
existences. The Buddha himself uses this
 term when speaking of his life prior to
 enlightenment (e.g. M. 4, M. 26). 
Bodhisattahood is neither mentioned nor 
recommended as an ideal higher than or 
alternative to Arahatship; nor is there 
any record in the Pa^li scriptures of a 
disciple declaring it as his aspiration.

<xa>bojjhanga</xa>
  'the 7 factors of enlightenment', are:
 mindfulness (sati-sambojjhanga; s. sati

vicaya-sambojjhanga), energy (viriya-
sambojjhanga; s. viriya, padha^na), 
rapture (pi^ti-sambojjhanga, q.v.) 
tranquillity (passaddhi-sambojjhanga, q.
v.), concentration (sama^dhi-
sambojjhanga, q.v.), equanimity (upekkha
^, q.v.). "Because they lead to 
enlightenment, therefore they are called
 factors of enlightenment" (S. XLVI, 5).
Though in the 2nd factor, dhamma-vicaya,
 the word dhamma is taken by most 
translators to stand for the Buddhist 
doctrine, it probably refers to the 
bodily and mental phenomena (na^ma-rúpa-
dhamma^) as presented to the 
investigating mind by mindfulness, the 
1st factor. With that interpretation, 
the term may be rendered by '
investigation of phenomena'.
In A.X. 102, the 7 factors are said to 
<pb n="111"/>
be the means of attaining the threefold 
wisdom (s. tevijja^).
They may be attained by means of the 4 
foundations of mindfulness (satipattha^
na, q.v.), as it is said in S. XLVI, 1 
and explained in M. 118:
(1) "Whenever, o monks, the monk dwells 
contemplating the body (ka^ya), feeling 
(vedana^), mind (citta) and mind-objects
 (dhamma^), strenuous, clearly-conscious
, mindful, after subduing worldly greed 
and grief, at such a time his 
mindfulness is present and undisturbed; 
and whenever his mindfulness is present 
and undisturbed, at such a time he has 
gained and is developing the factor of 
enlightenment 'mindfulness' (sati-
sambojjhanga), and thus this factor of 
enlightenment reaches fullest perfection
.
(2) "Whenever, while dwelling with 
mindfulness, he wisely investigates, 
examines and thinks over the law ... at 
such a time he has gained and is 
developing the factor of enlightenment '
investigation of the law' (dhamma-vicaya
°) ....
(3) "Whenever, while wisely 
investigating his energy is firm and 
unshaken ... at such a time he has 
<pb n="112"/>
gained and is developing the factor of 
enlightenment 'energy' (viriya°) ....
(4) "Whenever in him, while firm in 
energy, arises supersensuous rapture ...
 at such a time he has gained and is 
developing the factor of enlightenment '
rapture' (pi^ti°) ..
(5) "Whenever, while enraptured in mind,
 his body and his mind become composed .
.. at such a time he has gained and is 
developing the factor of enlightenment '
tranquillity' (passaddhi°).
(6) "Whenever, while being composed in 
his body and happy, his mind becomes 
concentrated ... at such a time he has 
gained and is developing the factor of 
enlightenment 'concentration' (sama^dhi°
)
(7) "Whenever he looks with complete 
indifference on his mind thus 
concentrated ... at such a time he has 
gained and is developing the factor of 
enlightenment 'equanimity' (upekkha^).

<xa>brahma loka</xa>
 'Brahma-world', in the widest sense, is

first three heavens of the fine-material
 world. Cf. Brahma-ka^yika-deva.

<xa>brahma viha^ra</xa>
 the 4 'sublime' or 'divine abodes', 
also called the 4 boundless states (

metta^), compassion (karuna^), 
altruistic (or sympathetic) joy (mudita^
), equanimity (upekkha^).
The stereotype text on the development 
<pb n="115"/>
of these 4 sublime abodes (brahma-viha^
ra-bha^vana^; s. bha^vana^), often met 
with in the Suttas,- is as follows: "'
There, o monks, the monk with a mind 
full of loving-kindness pervading first 
one direction, then a second one, then a
 third one, then the fourth one, just so
 above, below and all around; and 
everywhere identifying himself with all,
 he is pervading the whole world with 
mind full of loving-kindness, with mind 
wide, developed, unbounded, free from 
hate and ill-will." Hereafter follows 
the same theme with compassion, 
altruistic joy, and equanimity.

<xa>cetana^</xa>
  'volition', will, is one of the seven 
mental factors (cetasika, q.v.) 
inseparably bound up with all 
consciousness, namely sensorial or 
mental impression (phassa), feeling (
vedana^), perception (san~n~a^), 
volition (cetana^), concentration (sama^
dhi), vitality (ji^vita), advertence (
manasika^ra). Cf. Tab. II, III.
With regard to karmical volition (i.e. 
wholesome or unwholesome karma) it is 
said in A. VI, 13: "Volition is action (
karma), thus I say, o monks; for as soon
 as volition arises, one does the action
, be it by body, speech or mind." For 
details, s. paticca-samuppa^da (10), 
karma.

<xa>cetasika</xa>
  'mental things, mental factors', are 
those mental concomitants which are 
bound up with the simultaneously arising
 consciousness (citta = vin~n~a^na) and 
conditioned by its presence . Whereas in
 the Suttas all phenomena of existence 
<pb n="121"/>
are summed up under the aspect of 5 
groups: corporeality, feeling, 
perception, mental formations, 
consciousness (s. khandha), the 
Abhidhamma as a rule treats them under 
the more philosophical 3 aspects: 
consciousness, mental factors and 
corporeality (citta, cetasika, rúpa). 
Thus, of these 3 aspects, the mental 
factors (cetasika) comprise feeling, 
perception and the 50 mental formations,
 altogether 52 mental concomitants. Of 
these, 25 are lofty qualities (either 
karmically wholesome or neutral), 14 
karmically unwholesome, while 13 are as 
such karmically neutral, their karmical 
quality depending on whether they are 
associated with wholesome, unwholesome 
or neutral consciousness. For details s.
 Tab. II, III. Cf. prec. (App . )

<xa>cetaso vinibandha</xa>
 'mental bondages', are 5 things which 
hinder the mind from making right 
exertion, namely: lust for sensuous 
objects, for the body, for visible 
things, for eating and sleeping, and 
leading the monk's life for the sake of 
heavenly rebirth. For details, s. A.V,

<xa>cetokhila</xa>
  'mental obduracies', are 5 things 
which stiffen and hinder the mind from

about the (holy) Brotherhood, about the 
training, and anger against one's fellow
-monks. For details s. A.V, 206, X 14; D

<xa>ceto pariya n~a^na</xa>
 'penetrating knowledge of the mind (of 
others)', is one of the 6 higher powers 
(abhin~n~a^ 3, q.v.).

<xa>ceto vimutti</xa>
 'deliverance of mind'. In the highest 
sense it signifies the fruition of 
Arahatship (s. ariya-puggala), and in 
particular, the concentration associated
 with it. It is often linked with the '
deliverance through wisdom' (pan~n~a^-
vimutti, q.v.), e.g. in the ten powers 
of a Perfect One (s. dasa-bala). See 
vimokkha I.
It is also called 'unshakable 
deliverance of mind' (akuppa-c.); 
further 'boundless d. of m'. (appama^na-
c.); 'd. of m. from the conditions of 
<pb n="123"/>
existence, or signless d. of m.' (
animitta^-c.); 'd. of m. from the 
appendages' (a^kincan~n~a-c.), since 
that state of mind is free from the 3 
bonds, conditions and appendants, i.e. 
from greed, hatred and ignorance; and 
since it is void thereof, it is called 
the 'void deliverance of mind' (sun~n~
ata^-c.)
In a more restricted sense, 'boundless 
deliverance of mind' is a name for the 4
 boundless states, i.e. loving-kindness,
 compassion, altruistic joy and 
equanimity (s. brahma-viha^ra); 'd. of m
. from the appendages' stands for the '
sphere of nothingness' (a^kin~can~n~a^
yatana s. jha^na 7); 'd. of mind from 
the conditions of existence', for d. of 
mind due to non-attention to all 
conditions of existence; 'void d. of m' 
for d. of m. due to contemplating 
voidness of self. For further details, s

<xa>chanda</xa>
  intention, desire, will.
1. As an ethically neutral psychological
 term, in the sense of 'intention', it 
is one of those general mental factors (
cetasika, q.v. Tab. II) taught in the 
Abhidhamma, the moral quality of which 
is determined by the character of the 
volition (cetana^, q.v.) associated 
therewith. The Com. explains it as 'a 
wish to do' (kattu-kamyata^-chanda). If 
intensified, it acts also as a '
predominance condition' (s. paccaya 3).
2. As an evil quality it has the meaning
 of 'desire', and is frequently coupled 
with terms for 'sensuality', 'greed', 
etc., for instance: ka^ma-cchanda, '
sensuous desire', one of the 5 
hindrances (s. ni^varana); chanda-ra^ga,
 'lustful desire' (s. ka^ma). It is one 
of the 4 wrong paths (s. agati).
3. As a good quality it is a righteous 
will or zeal (dhamma-chanda) and occurs,
 e.g. in the formula of the 4 right 
efforts (s. padha^na): "The monk rouses 
his will (chandam janeti)...." If 
intensified, it is one of the 4 roads to
 power (s. iddhipa^da).

consciousness (citta), mental 
concomitants (cetasika, q.v.) and

In adhicitta, 'higher mentality', it 
signifies the concentrated, quietened

 'consciousness-moment', is the time 
occupied by one single stage in the

cittavi^thi; s. vin~n~a^na-kicca). This 
moment again is subdivided into the 
genetic (uppa^da), static (thiti) and 
dissolving (bhanga) moment. One such 
moment is said in the commentaries to be
<pb n="127"/>
 of inconceivably short duration and to 
last not longer than the billionth part 
of the time occupied by a flash of 
lightning. However that may be, we 
ourselves know from experience that it 
is possible within one single second to 
dream of innumerable things and events. 
In A. I, 10 it is said: "Nothing, o

 as consciousness. Scarcely anything may

Therefore long life, good appearance, 
happiness and strength will be his share
, whether amongst heavenly beings or 
amongst men" (A. IV, 57).
"Five blessings accrue to the giver of 
alms: the affection of many, noble 
association, good reputation, self-
confidence, and heavenly rebirth" (see A
<pb n="134"/>
. V, 34). Seven further blessings are 
given in A. VII, 54.
Liberality, especially the offering of 
robes, food, etc., to the monks, is 
highly praised in all Buddhist countries
 of Southern Asia as a fundamental 
virtue and as a means to suppress man's 
inborn greed and egoism. But, as in any 
other good or bad action, so also in 
offering gifts, it is the noble 
intention and volition that really 
counts as the action, not the mere 
outward deed.
Almsgiving or liberality (da^na), 
constitutes the first. kind of 
meritorious activity, the two others 
being morality (si^la, q.v.) and mental 
development (bha^vana^); s. pun~n~a-

 (lit: the Radiant Ones; related to Lat.

 worlds, and who, as a rule, are 
invisible to the human eye. They are 
subject, however, just like all human 
and other beings, to ever-repeated 
rebirth, old age and death, and thus are
 not freed from the cycle of existence 
and from misery. There are many classes 
of heavenly beings.
I. The 6 classes of heavenly beings of 
the sensuous sphere (ka^ma^vacara or ka^
ma-loka; s. avacara loka), are Ca^tumaha
^ra^jika-deva, Ta^vatimsa, Ya^ma, Tusita
 (s. Bodhisatta), Nimma^na-rati, 
Paranimmita-vasavatti. Cf. anussati. (6)
<pb n="140"/>
.
II. The heavenly beings of the fine-
material sphere (rúpa^vacara or rúpaloka
) are:
1. Brahma-pa^risajja, Brahma-purohita, 
Maha^-brahma^no (s. brahma-ka^yika-deva)
. Amongst these 3 classes will be reborn
 those with a weak, medium or full 
experience of the 1st absorption (jha^na
, q.v.).
2. Paritta^bha, Appama^na^bha, a^
bhassara. Here will be reborn those with
 experience of the 2nd absorption.
3. Paritta-subha, Appama^na-subha, Subha
-kinna (or kinha). Here will be reborn 
those with experience of the 3rd 
absorption.
4. Vehapphala, Asan~n~a-satta (q.v.), 
Suddha^va^sa (q.v.; further s. Ana^ga^mi
). Amongst the first 2 classes will be 
reborn those with experience of the 4th 
absorption, but amongst the 3rd class 
only Ana^ga^mis (q.v.).
III. The 4 grades of heavenly beings of 
the immaterial sphere (arúpa^vacara or 
arúpa-loka) are: the heavenly beings of 
the sphere of unbounded space (a^ka^sa^
nan~ca^yatanúpaga-deva^), of unbounded 
consciousness (vin~n~a^nan~ca^yatanúpaga
-deva), of nothingness (a^kin~can~n~a^
<pb n="141"/>
yatanúpaga deva^), of neither-perception
-nor- non-perception (nevasan~n~a^-na^
san~n~a^yatanúpaga-deva^). Here will be 
reborn those with experience of the 4 
immaterial spheres (arúpa^yatana; s. jha
^na 5-8).

Story (WHEEL 180/181).

<xa>deva dúta</xa>
 'divine messengers', is a symbolic name
 for old age, disease and death, since 
these three things remind man of his 
future and rouse him to earnest striving
. In A. III, 35, it is said:
"Did you, o man, never see in the world 
a man or a woman eighty, ninety or a 
hundred years old, frail, crooked as a 
gable-roof, bent down, resting on 
crutches, with tottering steps, infirm, 
youth long since fled, with broken teeth
, grey and scanty hair, or baldheaded, 
wrinkled, with blotched limbs? And did 
it never occur to you that you also are 
subject to old age, that you also cannot
 escape it?
"Did you never see in the world a man or
 a woman, who being sick, afflicted and 
grievously ill, and wallowing in their 
own filth, was lifted up by some people,
<pb n="142"/>
 and put down by others? And did it 
never occur to you that you also are 
subject to disease, that you also cannot
 escape it?
"Did you never see in the world the 
corpse of a man or a woman, one or two 
or three days after death, swollen up, 
blue-black in colour, and full of 
corruption? And did it never occur to 
you that you also are subject to death, 
that you also cannot escape it?" - See M

  lit. the 'bearer', constitution (or

doctrine; justice, righteousness; 
quality; thing, object of mind (s. a^

meanings the word 'dhamma' is to be met 
with in the texts. The Com. to D. 
instances 4 applications of this term 
guna (quality, virtue), desana^ (
instruction), pariyatti (text), nijji^
vata^ (soullessness, e.g. "all dhamma^, 
phenomena, are impersonal," etc.). The 
Com. to Dhs. has hetu (condition)

<xa>dha^tu</xa>
  'elements', are the ultimate 
constituents of a whole.
(1) The 4 physical elements (dha^tu or 
maha^-bhúta), popularly called earth, 
water, fire and wind, are to be 
understood as the primary qualities of 
matter. They are named in Pa^li: pathavi
^-dha^tu, a^po-dha^tu, tejo-dha^tu, and 
va^yo-dha^tu. In Vis.M. XI, 2 the four 
elements are defined thus: "Whatever is 
characterized by hardness (thaddha-
lakkkhana) is the earth or solid-element
; by cohesion (a^bandhana) or fluidity, 
the water-element; by heating (paripa^
cana), the fire or heat-element; by 
strengthening or supporting (
vitthambhana), the wind or motion-
element. All four are present in every 
material object, though in varying 
degrees of strength. If, for instance, 
<pb n="147"/>
the earth element predominates, the 
material object is called 'solid', etc. 
- For the analysis of the 4 elements, s.
 dha^tu-vavattha^na.
(II) The 18 physical and mental elements
 that constitute the conditions or 
foundations of the process of perception
, are:
 
1. visual organ (eye) 9. gustative 
object
2. auditory organ (ear) 10. body-
impression
3. olfactory organ (nose) 11. eye-
consciousness
4. gustatory organ (tongue) 12. ear-
consciousness
5. tactile organ (body) 13. nose-
consciousness
6. visible object 14. tongue-
consciousness
7. sound or audible object 15. body-
consciousness
8. odour or olfactive object
16. mind-element 17. mind-object
(mano-dha^tu) (dhamma-dha^tu)
18. mind-consciousness-element
(mano-vin~n~a^na-dha^tu)
 
1-10 are physical; 11-16 and 18 are 
<pb n="148"/>
mental; 17 may be either physical or 
mental. - 16 performs the function of 
advertence (a^vajjana) towards the 
object at the inception of a process of 
sensuous consciousness; it further 
performs the function of receiving (
sampaticchana) the sensuous object. 18 
performs, e.g., the function of 
investigation (santi^rana), determining 
(votthapana) and registering (tada^
rammana) - (for its other functions, s. 
Table I). For the 14 functions of 
consciousness, s. vin~n~a^na-kicca.
Cf. M. 115; S. XIV and especially Vibh. 
II (Guide p. 28f), Vis.M. XV, 17ff.
Of the many further groupings of 
elements (enumerated in M. 115), the 
best known is that of the 3 world-
elements: the sensuous world (ka^ma-dha^
tu), the fine-material world (rúpa-dha^
tu), the immaterial world (arúpa-dha^tu)
; further the sixfold group: the solid, 
liquid, heat, motion, space, 
consciousness (pathavi^, a^po, tejo, va^
yo, a^ka^sa, vin~n~a^na; s. above I), 
described in M. 140; see also M. 112.

<xa>dha^tu vavattha^na</xa>
 'analysis (or determining) of the 4 
elements', is described in Vis.M. XI, 2,
<pb n="149"/>
 as the last of the 40 mental exercises 
(s. bha^vana^). In a condensed form this
 exercise is handed down in D. 22 and M.
 10 (s. satipattha^na), but in detail 
explained in M. 28, 62, 140. The simile 
of the butcher in M. 10 ("Just, o monks,
 as a skilled butcher or butcher's 
apprentice, after having slaughtered a 
cow and divided it into separate 
portions, should sit down at the 
junction of four highroads; just so does
 the disciple contemplate this body with
 regard to the elements") is thus 
explained in Vis.M. XI.: "To the butcher
, who rears the cow, brings it to the 
slaughter-house, ties it, puts it there,
 slaughters it, or looks at the 
slaughtered and dead cow, the idea 'cow'
 does not disappear as long as he has 
not yet cut the body open and taken it 
to pieces. As soon, however, as he sits 
down, after having cut it open and taken
 it to pieces, the idea 'cow' disappears
 to him, and the idea 'meat' arises. And
 he does not think: 'A cow do I sell, or
 'A cow do they buy.' Just so, when the 
monk formerly was still an ignorant 
worldling, layman or a homeless one, the
 ideas 'living being' or 'man' or '
individual' had not yet disappeared as 
<pb n="150"/>
long as he had not taken this body, 
whatever position or direction it had, 
to pieces and analysed it piece by piece
. As soon, however, as he analysed this 
body into its elements, the idea 'living
 being' disappeared to him, and his mind
 became established in the contemplation
 of the elements." - (App.).

<xa>dhuta^nga</xa>
  (lit. 'means of shaking off (the 
defilements)'); 'means of purification',
 ascetic or austere practices. These are
 strict observances recommended by the 
Buddha to monks as a help to cultivate 
contentedness, renunciation, energy and 
the like. One or more of them may be 
observed for a shorter or longer period 
of time.
"The monk training himself in morality 
should take upon himself the means of 
purification, in order to gain those 
virtues through which the purity of 
morality will become accomplished, to 
wit: fewness of needs, contentedness, 
austerity, detachment, energy, 
moderation, etc." (Vis.M. II).
 
Vis.M. II describes 13 dhutangas, 
consisting in the vows of
<pb n="151"/>
1. wearing patched-up robes: pamsukúlik'
anga,
2. wearing only three robes: teci^varik'
anga,
3. going for alms: pindapa^tik'anga,
4. not omitting any house whilst going 
for alms: sapada^nikanga,
5. eating at one sitting: eka^sanik'anga
,
6. eating only from the alms-bowl: 
pattapindik'anga,
7. refusing all further food: khalu-
paccha^-bhattik'anga,
8. living in the forest: a^ran~n~ik'anga
,
9. living under a tree: rukkha-múlik'
anga,
10. living in the open air: abbhoka^sik'
anga,
11. living in a cemetery: susa^nik'anga,
12. being satisfied with whatever 
dwelling: yatha^-santhatik'anga,
13. sleeping in the sitting position (
and never lying down): nesajjik'anga.
 
These 13 exercises are all, without 
exception, mentioned in the old sutta 
texts (e.g. M. 5, 113; A.V., 181-90), 
but never together in one and the same 
place.
<pb n="152"/>
"Without doubt, o monks, it is a great 
advantage to live in the forest as a 
hermit, to collect one's alms, to make 
one's robes from picked-up rags, to be 
satisfied with three robes" (A.I, 30).
The vow, e.g. of No. 1, is taken in the 
words: "I reject robes offered to me by 
householders," or "I take upon myself 
the vow of wearing only robes made from 
picked-up rags." Some of the exercises 
may also be observed by the lay-adherent
.
Here it may be mentioned that each newly
 ordained monk, immediately after his 
being admitted to the Order, is advised 
to be satisfied with whatever robes, 
alms-food, dwelling and medicine he gets
: "The life of the monks depends on the 
collected alms as food ... on the root 
of a tree as dwelling ... on robes made 
from patched-up rags ... on stale cow's 
urine as medicine. May you train 
yourself therein all your life."
Since the moral quality of any action 
depends entirely upon the accompanying 
intention and volition, this is also the
 case with these ascetic practices, as 
is expressly stated in Vis.M. Thus the 
mere external performance is not the 
real exercise, as it is said (Pug. 275-
<pb n="153"/>
84): "Some one might be going for alms; 
etc. out of stupidity and foolishness - 
or with evil intention and filled with 
desires - or out of insanity and mental 
derangement - or because such practice 
had been praised by the Noble Ones...." 
These exercises are, however properly 
observed "if they are taken up only for 
the sake of frugality, of contentedness,
 of purity, etc."(App.)

life; s. karma.

<xa>ditthi</xa>
 (lit. 'sight'; ? dis, to see): view, 
belief, speculative opinion, insight. If
 not qualified by samma^, 'right', it 
mostly refers to wrong and evil view or 
opinion, and only in a few instances to 
right view, understanding or insight (e.
g. ditthi-ppatta, q.v.; ditthi-visuddhi,
 purification of insight; ditthi-
sampanna, possessed of insight).
Wrong or evil views (ditthi or miccha^-
ditthi) are declared as utterly 
rejectable for being a source of wrong 
and evil aspirations and conduct, and 
liable at times to lead man to the 
deepest abysses of depravity, as it is 
said in A. I, 22:
"No other thing than evil views do I 
know, o monks, whereby to such an extent
 the unwholesome things not yet arisen 
arise, and the unwholesome things 
already arisen are brought to growth and
 fullness. No other thing than evil 
views do I know, whereby to such an 
extent the wholesome things not yet 
arisen are hindered in their arising, 
and the wholesome things already arisen 
disappear. No other thing than evil 
<pb n="156"/>
views do I know, whereby to such an 
extent human beings at the dissolution 
of the body, at death, are passing to a 
way of suffering, into a world of woe, 
into hell." Further in A. I, 23: "
Whatever a man filled with evil views 
performs or undertakes, or whatever he 
possesses of will, aspiration, longing 
and tendencies, all these things lead 
him to an undesirable, unpleasant and 
disagreeable state, to woe and suffering
."
From the Abhidhamma (Dhs) it may be 
inferred that evil views, whenever they 
arise, are associated with greed (s. Tab
. I. 22, 23, 26, 27).
Numerous speculative opinions and 
theories, which at all times have 
influenced and still are influencing 
mankind, are quoted in the sutta-texts. 
Amongst them, however, the wrong view 
which everywhere, and at all times, has 
most misled and deluded mankind is the 
personality-belief, the ego-illusion. 
This personality-belief (sakka^ya-ditthi
), or ego-illusion (atta-ditthi), is of 
2 kinds: eternity-belief and 
annihilation-belief.
Eternity-belief (sassata-ditthi) is the 
belief in the existence of a persisting 
<pb n="157"/>
ego-entity, soul or personality, 
existing independently of those physical
 and mental processes that constitute 
life and continuing even after death.
Annihilation-belief (uccheda-ditthi), on
 the other hand, is the belief in the 
existence of an ego-entity or 
personality as being more or less 
identical with those physical and mental
 processes, and which therefore, at the 
dissolution at death, will come to be 
annihilated. - For the 20 kinds of 
personality-belief, see sakka^ya-ditthi.
Now, the Buddha neither teaches a 
personality which will continue after 
death, nor does he teach a personality 
which will be annihilated at death, but 
he shows us that 'personality', 'ego', '
individual', 'man', etc., are nothing 
but mere conventional designations (voha
^ra-vacana) and that in the ultimate 
sense (s. paramattha-sacca) there is 
only this self-consuming process of 
physical and mental phenomena which 
continually arise and again disappear 
immediately. - For further details, s. 
anatta^, khandha, paticcasamuppa^da.
"The Perfect One is free from any theory
 (ditthigata), for the Perfect One has 
seen what corporeality is, and how it 
<pb n="158"/>
arises and passes away. He has seen what
 feeling ... perception ... mental 
formations ... consciousness are, and 
how they arise and pass away. Therefore 
I say that the Perfect One has won 
complete deliverance through the 
extinction, fading away, disappearance, 
rejection and casting out of all 
imaginings and conjectures, of all 
inclination to the 'vain-glory of 'I' 
and 'mine." (M. 72).
The rejection of speculative views and 
theories is a prominent feature in a 
chapter of the Sutta-Nipa^ta, the 
Atthaka-Vagga.
The so-called 'evil views with fixed 
destiny' (niyata-miccha^ditthi) 
constituting the last of the 10 
unwholesome courses of action (
kammapatha, q.v.), are the following 
three: (1) the fatalistic 'view of the 
uncausedness' of existence (
ahetukaditthi), (2) the view of the 
inefficacy of action' (akiriyaditthi), (
3) nihilism (natthikaditthi).
(1) was taught by Makkhali-Gosa^la, a 
contemporary of the Buddha who denied 
every cause for the corruptness and 
purity of beings, and asserted that 
everything is minutely predestined by 
<pb n="159"/>
fate.
(2) was taught by Púrana-Kassapa, 
another contemporary of the Buddha who 
denied every karmical effect of good and
 bad actions: "To him who kills, steals,
 robs, etc., nothing bad will happen. 
For generosity, self-restraint and 
truthfulness, etc. no reward is to be 
expected."
(3) was taught by Ajita-Kesakambali, a 
third contemporary of the Buddha who 
asserted that any belief in good action 
and its reward is a mere delusion, that 
after death no further life would follow
, that man at death would become 
dissolved into the elements, etc.
For further details about these 3 views,
 s. D. 2, M. 60; commentarial exposition
 in WHEEL 98/99, P. 23.
Frequently mentioned are also the 10 
antinomies (antaga^hika^ miccha^-ditthi)
: 'Finite is the world' or 'infinite is 
the world' ... 'body and soul are 
identical' or 'body and soul are 
different' (e.g. M. 63).
In the Brahma^jala Sutta .(D.1), 62 
false views are classified and described
, comprising all conceivable wrong views
 and speculations about man and world.

<xa>dukkha</xa>
  (1) 'pain', painful feeling, which may
 be bodily and mental (s. vedana^).
(2) 'Suffering', 'ill'. As the first of 
the Four Noble Truths (s. sacca) and the
 second of the three characteristics of 
existence (s. ti-lakkhana), the term 
dukkha is not limited to painful 
experience as under (1), but refers to 
the unsatisfactory nature and the 
general insecurity of all conditioned 
phenomena which, on account of their 
impermanence, are all liable to 
suffering, and this includes also 
<pb n="164"/>
pleasurable experience. Hence '
unsatisfactoriness' or 'liability to 
suffering' would be more adequate 
renderings, if not for stylistic reasons
. Hence the first truth does not deny 
the existence of pleasurable experience,
 as is sometimes wrongly assumed. This 
is illustrated by the following texts:
"Seeking satisfaction in the world, 
monks, I had pursued my way. That 
satisfaction in the world I found. In so
 far as satisfaction existed in the 
world, I have well perceived it by 
wisdom. Seeking for misery in the world,
 monks, I had pursued my way. That 
misery in the world I found. In so far 
as misery existed in the world, I have 
well perceived it by wisdom. Seeking for
 the escape from the world, monks, I had
 pursued my way. That escape from the 
world I found. In so far as an escape 
from the world existed, I have well 
perceived it by wisdom" (A. 111, 101).
"If there were no satisfaction to be 
found in the world, beings would not be 
attached to the world .... If there were
 no misery to be found in the world, 
beings would not be repelled by the 
world .... If there were no escape from 
the world, beings could not escape 
<pb n="165"/>
therefrom" (A. 111, 102).

 Suffering, see W. of B. and 'Path'.

<xa>dukkhata^</xa>
 (abstr. noun fr. dukkha): 'the state of
 suffering', painfulness, unpleasantness

There are three kinds of suffering: (1) 
suffering as pain (dukkha-dukkhata^), (2
) the suffering inherent in the 
formations (sankha^ra-dukkhata^), (3) 
the suffering in change (viparina^ma-

(1) is the bodily or mental feeling of 
pain as actual]y felt. (2) refers to the
 oppressive nature of all formations of 
existence (i.e. all conditioned 
phenomena), due to their continual 
arising and passing away; this includes 
also experiences associated with neutral
 feeling. (3) refers to bodily and 
mental pleasant feelings, "because they 
are the cause for the arising of pain 
when they change" (Vis.M. XIV, 34f).

immediately preceding the entering into

II. The 'Matured One'. "He who is 
endowed with those things, immediately 
upon which follows the entrance into the
 noble path (ariya-magga), this person 
<pb n="178"/>
is called a 'Matured One'." (Pug 10). In
 the Com. to this passage it is said: "
He who through perceiving Nibba^na, 
leaves behind the whole multitude of 
worldlings (puthujjana, q.v.), the 
family of worldlings, the circle of 
worldlings, the designation of a 
worldling and enters into the multitude 
of the Noble Ones, the family of the 
Noble Ones, the circle of the Noble Ones
, and obtains the designation of a Noble
 One, such a being is called a Matured 
One." By this state of consciousness is 
meant the lightning-like transitional

and that of a Sota^panna; s. ariya-

<xa>hadaya vatthu</xa>
 'heart as physical base' of mental life
. The heart, according to the 
commentaries as well as to the general 
Buddhist tradition, forms the physical 
base (vatthu) of consciousness In the 
canonical texts, however, even in the 
Abhidhamma Pitaka, no such base is ever 
localized, a fact which seems to have 
first been discovered by Shwe Zan Aung (
Compendium of Philosophy, pp. 277ff.). 
In the Patth. we find repeatedly only 
the passage: "That material thing based 
on which mind-element and mind-
consciousness element function" (yam rú
pam nissa^ya manodha^tu ca mano-vin~n~a^
na-dha^tu ca vattanti, tam rúpam).

 morality, etc. connected with progress;
 nibbedha-bha^giya si^la, etc.: morality
, etc. connected with penetration. Cf. A

" 'Decline' (ha^na) is to be understood 
with regard to the arising of opposing 
qualities, 'standstill' (thiti) with 
regard to the standstill of the 
corresponding attentiveness, 'progress' 
(visesa) with regard to higher 
excellency, 'penetration' (nibbedha)

  'cause', condition, reason; (

usage it is almost synonymous with 
paccaya, 'condition', and often occurs 
together with it ('What is the cause, 
what is the condition', ko hetu ko 
paccayo).
In Abhidhamma, it denotes the wholesome 
and unwholesome roots (múla, q.v.). In 
that sense, as 'root-condition' (hetu-
paccaya; s. paccaya), it is the first of
 the 24 conditions given in the 
introduction to the Pattha^na (s. Guide,
 p. 117). The Dhs (1052-1082) and Pattha
^na (Duka-patth; Guide, p. 144) have 
sections on roots (hetu). - The term is 
also used (a) for the classification of 
consciousness, as sa-hetuka and a-hetuka
, with and without concomitant root-
conditions; (b) for a division of 
rebirth consciousness into ahetuka, 
dvihetuka and tihetuka, without, with 2,
 or with 3 root-conditions (s. 
patisandhi).

"To be ashamed of what one ought to be 
ashamed of, to be ashamed of performing 
evil and unwholesome things: this is 
called moral shame. To be in dread of 
what one ought to be in dread of, to be 
in dread of performing evil and 
unwholesome things: this is called moral
 dread" (Pug, 79, 80).
"Two lucid things, o monks, protect the 
world: moral shame and moral dread. If 
these two things were not to protect the
 world, then one would respect neither 
one's mother, nor one's mother's sister,
 nor one's brother's wife, nor one's

<xa>iddhi</xa>
  'power', 'magical power'. The magical 
powers constitute one of the 6 kinds of 
higher spiritual powers (abhin~n~a^, q.v
.). One distinguishes many kinds of 
magical powers: the power of 
determination (adhittha^n' iddhi), i.e. 
the power of becoming oneself manifold; 
the power of transformation (vikubbana 
iddhi), i.e. the power of adopting 
another form; the power of spiritual 
creation (manomaya iddhi), i.e. the 
power of letting issue from this body 
another mentally produced body; the 
power of penetrating knowledge (n~a^na-
vipphara iddhi), i.e. the power of 
inherent insight to remain unhurt in 
danger; the power of penetrating 
concentration (sama^dhivipphara^ iddhi) 
producing the same result. The magical 
powers are treated in detail in Vis.M. 
XII; Pts.M., Vibh. - (App.). They are 
not a necessary condition for final 
<pb n="186"/>
deliverance.
'Noble power' (ariya^-iddhi) is the 
power of controlling one's ideas in such
 a way that one may consider something 
not repulsive as repulsive and something
 repulsive as not repulsive, and remain 
all the time imperturbable and full of 
equanimity. This training of mind is 
frequently mentioned in the Suttas (e.g.
 M. 152, A.V. 144), but only once the 
name of ariya^-iddhi is applied to it (D
. 28). See further Pts.M., Iddhi-katha^,
 Vis.M. XII.

<xa>iddhi pa^da</xa>
 'roads to power' (or success) are the 4
 following qualities, "for as guides, 
they indicate the road to power 
connected therewith; and because they 
form, by way of preparation, the roads 
to the power constituting the fruition 
of the path" (Vis.M. XII), namely: "
concentration of intention (chanda-sama^
dhi) accompanied by effort of will (
padha^na-sankha^ra-samanna^gata), 
concentration of energy (viriya-sama^dhi
) ... concentration of consciousness (
citta-sama^dhi) ... and concentration of
 investigation (vimamsa-sama^dhi) 
accompanied by effort of will." As such,
<pb n="187"/>
 they are supermundane (lokuttara, i.e. 
connected with the path or the fruition 
of the path; s. ariyapuggala) But they 
are mundane (lokiya, q.v.) as 
predominant factors (adhipati; s. 
paccaya 3), for it is said: "Because the
 monk, through making intention a 
predominant factor, reaches 
concentration, it is called the 
concentration of intention (chanda-sama^
dhi), etc." (Vis.M. XII).
"These 4 roads of power lead to the 
attaining and acquiring of magical power
, to the power of magical transformation
, to the generation of magical power, 
and to mastery and skill therein" (Pts.M
. II. 205, PTS). For a detailed 
explanation, s. Vis.M. XII.
"Once the monk has thus developed and 
often practised the 4 roads to power, he
 enjoys various magical powers, ... 
hears with the divine ear heavenly and 
human sounds, ... perceives with his 
mind the mind of other beings ... 
remembers many a former existence ... 
perceives with the divine eye beings 
passing away and reappearing, ... 
attains, after the extinction of cankers
, deliverance of mind and deliverance 
through wisdom, free from. cankers.... (
<pb n="188"/>
S. LI, 2). For a detailed explanation of
 these 6 higher powers, s. abhin~n~a^.
"Whosoever, o monks, has missed the 4 
roads to power, he has missed the right 
path leading to the extinction of 
suffering; but whosoever, o monks, has 
reached the 4 roads to power, he has 
reached the right path leading to the 
extinction of suffering" (S. LI, 2).

<xa>indriya samatta</xa>
 'equilibrium, balance, or harmony of 
faculties', relates to the 5 spiritual 
faculties: faith, energy, mindfulness, 
concentration and wisdom (s. indriya 15-
19). Of these there are two pairs of 
faculties, in each of which both 
faculties should well counter-balance 
each other, namely: faith and wisdom (
saddha^, pan~n~a^, q.v.) on the one hand
 and energy and concentration (viriya, 
sama^dhi, q.v.) on the other. For

<xa>javana</xa>
 (fr. javati, to impel): 'impulsion', is
<pb n="199"/>
 the phase of full cognition in the 
cognitive series, or perceptual process 
(citta-vi^thi; s. vin~n~a^na-kicca) 
occurring at its climax, if the 
respective object is large or distinct. 
It is at this phase that karma is 
produced, i.e. wholesome or unwholesome 
volition concerning the perception that 
was the object of the previous stages of
 the respective process of consciousness
. There are normally 7 impulsive moments
. In mundane consciousness (lokiya, q.v.
), any of the 17 karmically wholesome 
classes of consciousness (Tab. I, 1-17) 
or of the 12 unwholesome ones (Tab. I, 
22-23) may arise at the phase of 
impulsion. For the Arahat, however, 
impulsion has no longer a karmic, i.e. 
rebirth-producing character, but is a 
karmically independent function (kiriya,
 q.v.; Tab. I, 72-89). There are further
 8 supermundane classes of impulsion (
Tab. I, 18-21, 66-69).
The 4 impulsive moments immediately 
before entering an absorption (jha^na, q
.v.) or one of the supermundane paths (
magga; s. ariyapuggala) are: the 
preparatory (parikamma), approach (upaca
^ra), adaptation (anuloma), and maturity
-moment (gotrabhú, q.v.) In connection 
<pb n="200"/>
with entering the earth-kasina 
absorption (s. kasina), they are 
explained as follows, in Vis.M. IV: "
After the breaking off of the 
subconscious stream of being (bhavanga-
sota, q.v.), there arises the '
advertence at the mind-door' (manodva^ra
^vajjana, s. vin~n~a^nakicca), taking as
 object the earthkasina (whilst thinking
), 'Earth! Earth!' Thereupon, 4 or 5 
impulsive moments flash forth, amongst 
which the last one (maturity-moment) 
belongs to the fine-material sphere (rú
pa^vacara), whereas the rest belong to 
the sense-sphere (ka^ma^vacara; s. 
avacara), though the last one is more 
powerful in thought conception, 
discursive thinking, interest (rapture),
 joy and concentration (cf. jha^na) than
 the states of consciousness belonging 
to the sense-sphere. They are called '
preparatory' (parikamma-sama^dhi), as 
they are preparing for the attainment-
concentration (appana^-sama^dhi); '
approaching' (upaca^ra-sama^dhi), as 
they are close to the attainment-
concentration and are moving in its 
neighbourhood; 'adaptive' (anuloma), as 
they adapt themselves to the preceding 
preparatory states and to the succeeding
<pb n="201"/>
 attainment concentration. The last one 
of the four is called 'matured' (gotrabh
ú). In a similar way, the impulsive 
moments before reaching the divine ear 
are described in Vis.M. XIII, 1. - Cf. 
Karma - (App.).

<xa>jewels</xa>
  The 3: ti-ratana (q.v.).

<xa>jha^na</xa>
  'absorption' (meditation) refers 
chiefly to the four meditative 
absorptions of the fine-material sphere 
(rúpa-jjha^na or rúpa^vacara-jjha^na; s.
 avacara). They are achieved through the
 attainment of full (or attainment -, or
 ecstatic) concentration (appana^, s. 
sama^dhi), during which there is a 
complete, though temporary, suspension 
of fivefold sense-activity and of the 5 
hindrances (s. ni^varana). The state of 
consciousness, however, is one of full 
alertness and lucidity. This high degree
 of concentration is generally developed
 by the practice of one of the 40 
subjects of tranquillity meditation (
samatha-kammattha^na; s. bha^vana^). 
Often also the 4 immaterial spheres (arú
pa^yatana) are called absorptions of the
<pb n="202"/>
 immaterial sphere (arúpa-jjha^na or arú
pa^vacara-jjha^na). The stereotype text,
 often met with in the Suttas, runs as 
follows:
(1) "Detached from sensual objects, o 
monks, detached from unwholesome 
consciousness, attached with thought-
conception (vitakka) and discursive 
thinking (vica^ra), born of detachment (
vivekaja) and filled with rapture (pi^ti
) and joy (sukha) he enters the first 
absorption.
(2) "After the subsiding of thought-
conception and discursive thinking, and 
by gaining inner tranquillity and 
oneness of mind, he enters into a state 
free from thought-conception and 
discursive thinking, the second 
absorption, which is born of 
concentration (sama^dhi), and filled 
with rapture (pi^ti) and joy (sukha).
(3) "After the fading away of rapture he
 dwells in equanimity, mindful, clearly 
conscious; and he experiences in his 
person that feeling of which the Noble 
Ones say, 'Happy lives the man of 
equanimity and attentive mind'; thus he 
enters the 3rd absorption.
(4) "After having given up pleasure and 
pain, and through the disappearance of 
<pb n="203"/>
previous joy and grief, he enters into a
 state beyond pleasure and pain, into 
the 4th absorption, which is purified by
 equanimity (upekkha^) and mindfulness.
(5) "Through the total overcoming of the
 perceptions of matter, however, and 
through the vanishing of sense-reactions
 and the non-attention to the 
perceptions of variety, with the idea, '
Boundless is space', he reaches the 
sphere of boundless space (a^ka^sa^nan~
ca^yatana) and abides therein.
 
["By 'perceptions of matter' (rúpa-san~n
~a^) are meant the absorptions of the 
fine-material sphere, as well as those 
objects themselves . . . " (Vis.M. X, 1)
.
"By 'perceptions of sense-reactions' (
patigha-san~n~a^) are meant those 
perceptions that have arisen due to the 
impact of sense-organs (eye, etc.) and 
the sense-objects (visible objects, etc.
). They are a name for the perception of
 visible objects, as it is said (Jha^na-
Vibh . ): 'What are here the perceptions
 of sense-reactions? They are the 
perceptions of visible objects, sounds, 
etc.' - Surely, they do no longer exist 
even for one who has entered the 1st 
<pb n="204"/>
absorption, etc., for at such a time the
 five-sense consciousness is no longer 
functioning. Nevertheless, this is to be
 understood as having been said in 
praise of this immaterial absorption, in
 order to incite the striving for it" (
Vis.M. X, 16).
"Perceptions of variety (n~a^natta-san~n
~a^) are the perceptions that arise in 
various fields, or the various 
perceptions" (ib.). Hereby, according to
 Vis.M. X, 20, are meant the multiform 
perceptions outside the absorptions.]
 
(6) "Through the total overcoming of the
 sphere of boundless space, and with the
 idea 'Boundless is consciousness', he 
reaches the sphere of boundless 
consciousness (vin~n~a^nan~ca^yatana) 
and abides therein.
(7) "Through the total overcoming of the
 sphere of boundless consciousness, and 
with the idea 'Nothing is there', he 
reaches the sphere of nothingness (a^kin
~can~n~a^yatana) and abides therein.
(8) "Through the total overcoming of the
 sphere of nothingness he reaches the 
sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-
perception (nevasan~n~a^-n'asan~n~a^
yatana) and abides therein."
<pb n="205"/>
"Thus the 1st absorption is free from 5 
things (i.e. the hindrances, ni^varana, 
q.v.), and 5 things are present (i.e. 
the factors of absorption; jha^nanga). 
Whenever the monk enters the 1st 
absorption, there have vanished sensuous
 desire, ill-will, sloth and torpor, 
restlessness and scruples, doubts; and 
there are present: thought-conception (
vitakka), discursive thinking (vica^ra) 
rapture (pi^ti), joy (sukha), and 
concentration (sama^dhi). In the 2nd 
absorption there are present: rapture, 
joy and concentration; in the 3rd: joy 
and concentration; in the 4th: 
equanimity (upekkha^) and concentration"
 (Vis.M. IV).
The 4 absorptions of the immaterial 
sphere (s. above 5-8) still belong, 
properly speaking, to the 4th absorption
 as they possess the same two 
constituents. The 4th fine-material 
absorption is also the base or starting 
point (pa^daka-jha^na, q.v.) for the 
attaining of the higher spiritual powers
 (abhin~n~a^, q.v.).
In the Abhidhamma, generally a fivefold 
instead of a fourfold division of the 
fine-material absorptions is used: the 
2nd absorption has still the constituent
<pb n="206"/>
 'discursive thinking' (but without 
thought-conception), while the 3rd, 4th 
and 5th correspond to the 2nd, 3rd and 
4th, respectively, of the fourfold 
division (s. Tab. I, 9- 13) . This 
fivefold division is based on sutta 
texts like A . VIII, 63 .
For the 8 absorptions as objects for the
 development of insight (vipassana^), 
see samatha-vipassana^. - Full details 
in Vis.M. IV-X.
Jha^na in its widest sense (e.g. as one 
of the 24 conditions; s. paccaya 17), 
denotes any, even momentary or weak 
absorption of mind, when directed on a 
single object.

<xa>ji^va</xa>
  life, vital principle, individual soul
. 'Soul (life) and body are identical' 
and 'Soul and body are different', these
 two frequently quoted wrong views fall 
<pb n="207"/>
under the 2 kinds of personality-belief 
(sakka^ya-ditthi; s. ditthi), i.e. the 
first one under the annihilation-belief 
(uccheda-ditthi) and the second under 
the eternity-belief (sassata-ditthi).
"Verily, if one holds the view that the 
soul (life) is identical with the body, 
in that case a holy life is not possible
; or if one holds the view that the soul
 (life) is something quite different, 
also in that case a holy life is 
impossible. Both these extremes the 
Perfect One has avoided and shown the 
Middle Doctrine, which says: 'On 
ignorance depend the karma-formations, 
on the karma-formations depends 
consciousness', etc." (S. XII. 35).

<xa>ji^vita</xa>
 and ji^vitindriya: 'Life, vitality', 
may be either physical (rúpa-ji^

mental factors inseparably associated 
with all consciousness; cf. na^ma, 
cetana^, phassa.

<xa>kabalinka^ra^ha^ra</xa>
  lit. 'food formed into balls', i.e. 
food formed into mouthfuls for eating (
according to Indian custom); it denotes 
'material food' and belongs, together 
with the three mental nutriments, to the
 group of four nutriments (s. a^ha^ra).

<xa>kala^pa</xa>
  'group', 'unit': 1. 'corporeal unit' (
s. rúpa-kala^pa); 2. It has the meaning 
of 'group of existence' (khandha) in 
kala^pasammasana (s. sammasana), i.e. '
comprehension by groups', which is the 
application of 'methodical (or inductive
) insight' (naya-vipassana^) to the 
comprehension of the 5 aggregates (
khandha) as impermanent, painful and not
-self. It is a process of methodical 
summarization, or generalization, from 
one's own meditative experience that is 
applied to each of the 5 aggregates, 
viewed as past, present, future, as 
internal and external, etc. In Vis.M. XX
, where the 'comprehension by groups' is
 treated in detail, it is said to 
<pb n="209"/>
constitute 'the beginning of insight' as
 it leads to the 'knowledge of rise and 
fall', being the first of the 8 
insightknowledges (s. visuddhi VI). It 
is necessary for accomplishing the 5th 
purification (s. visuddhi V; Vis.M. XX, 
2, 6ff.).

<xa>kalpa</xa>

<xa>kalya^na mitta</xa>
 'noble (or good) friend', is called a 
senior monk who is the mentor and friend
 of his pupil, "wishing for his welfare 
and concerned with his progress", 
guiding his meditation; in particular, 
the meditation teacher (kammattha^na^
cariya) is so called. For details see 
Vis.M. III, 28,57ff. The Buddha said 
that "noble friendship is the entire 
holy life" (S. III, 18; XLV, 2), and he 
himself is the good friend par 
excellence: "Ananda, it is owing to my 
being a good friend to them that living 
beings subject to birth are freed from 
birth" (S. III, 18).

<xa>ka^ma</xa>
 may denote: 1. subjective sensuality, '
<pb n="210"/>
sense-desire'; 2. objective sensuality, 
the five sense-objects.
1. Subjective sensuality, or sense-
desire, is directed to all five sense-
objects, and is synonymous with ka^ma-
cchanda, 'sensuous desire', one of the 5
 hindrances (ni^varana, q.v.); ka^ma-ra^
ga, sensuous lust', one of the ten 
fetters (samyojana, q.v.); ka^ma-tanha^,
 'sensuous craving', one of the 3 
cravings (tanha^, q.v.); ka^ma-vitakka, 
'sensuous thought', one of the 3 wrong 
thoughts (miccha^-sankappa; s. vitakka).
 - Sense-desire is also one of the 
cankers (a^sava, q.v.) and clingings (
upa^da^na, q.v.).
2. Objective sensuality is, in the 
canonical texts, mostly called ka^ma-
guna, 'cords (or strands) of sensuality'
.
"There are 5 cords of sensuality: the 
visible objects, cognizable by eye-
consciousness, that are desirable, 
cherished, pleasant, lovely, sensuous 
and alluring; the sounds ... smells ... 
tastes ... bodily impressions cognizable
 by body-consciousness, that are 
desirable .... " (D. 33; M. 13, 26, 59, 
66).
These two kinds of ka^ma are called 1. 
<pb n="211"/>
kilesa-ka^ma, i.e. ka^ma as a mental 
defilement, 2. vatthu-ka^ma, i.e. ka^ma 
as the object-base of sensuality; first 
in MNid.. I, p. 1, and frequently in the
 commentaries.
Sense-desire is finally eliminated at 
the stage of the Non-Returner (Ana^ga^mi
; s. ariya-puggala, samyojana).
The peril and misery of sense-desire is 
often described in the texts, e.g. in 
stirring similes at M. 22, 54, and in 
the 'gradual instruction' (s. a^nupubbi^
-katha^). See further M. 13, 45, 75; Sn.
 v. 766ff.; Dhp. 186, 215.
The texts often stress the fact that 
what fetters man to the world of the 
senses are not the sense-organs nor the 
sense-objects but lustful desire (
chandara^ga). On this see A. VI, 63; S. 
XXXV, 122, 191. - (App.).

 under guardianship. The abstaining from
 this unlawful act is one of the 5 moral
 rules (s. sikkha^pada) binding upon all
<pb n="213"/>
 Buddhists. Through any other sexual act
 one does not become guilty of the above
 transgression, which is considered a 
great crime. The monk, however, has to 
observe perfect chastity.
In many Suttas (e.g. A.X., 176) we find 
the following explanation: "He avoids 
unlawful sexual intercourse, abstains 
from it. He has no intercourse with 
girls who are still under the protection
 of father or mother, brother, sister or
 relatives, nor with married women, nor 
female convicts, nor, lastly, with 
betrothed girls."

<xa>kammanta</xa>
  samma^-: 'right action'; s. magga.

<xa>kamma paccaya</xa>

<xa>kamma patha</xa>
 'course of action', is a name for the 
group of 10 kinds of either unwholesome 
or wholesome actions, viz.
I. The tenfold unwholesome courses of 
action (akusala-kamma-patha):
3 bodily actions: killing, stealing, 
unlawful sexual intercourse;
4 verbal actions: lying, slandering, 
rude speech, foolish babble;
3 mental actions: covetousness, ill-will
, evil views.
Unwholesome mental courses of action 
comprise only extreme forms of defiled 
thought: the greedy wish to appropriate 
others' property, the hateful thought of
 harming others, and pernicious views. 
Milder forms of mental defilement are 
also unwholesome, but do not constitute 
'courses of action'.
II. The tenfold wholesome course of 
action (kusala-kamma-patha):
<pb n="215"/>
3 bodily actions: avoidance of killing, 
stealing, unlawful sexual intercourse;
4 verbal actions: avoidance of lying, 
slandering, rude speech, foolish babble;
 i.e. true, conciliatory, mild, and wise
 speech;
3 mental actions: unselfishness, good-
will, right views.
Both lists occur repeatedly, e.g. in A. 
X, 28, 176; M. 9; they are explained in 
detail in M. 114, and in Com. to M. 9 (R
. Und., p. 14), Atthasa^lini Tr. I,

  'sensuous clinging', is one of the 4 
kinds of clinging (upa^da^na, q.v.).

<xa>kankha^</xa>
  'doubt', may be either an intellectual
, critical doubt or an ethically and 
psychologically detrimental doubt. The 
latter may either be a persistent 
negative skepticism or wavering 
indecision. Only the detrimental doubt (
identical with vicikiccha^, q.v.) is to 
be rejected as karmically unwholesome, 
as it paralyses thinking and hinders the
 inner development of man. Reasoned, 
critical doubt in dubious matters is 
thereby not discouraged.
The 16 doubts enumerated in the Suttas (
e.g. M. 2) are the following: "Have I 
been in the past? Or, have I not been in
 the past? What have I been in the past?
 How have I been in the past? From what 
state into what state did I change in 
the past? - Shall I be in the future? Or
, shall I not be in the future? What 
shall I be in the future? How shall I be
 in the future? From what state into 
what state shall I change in the future?
 - Am I? Or, am I not? What am I? How am
 I? Whence has this being come? Whither 
will it go?"
<pb n="217"/>

<xa>kankha^ vitarana visuddhi</xa>
 'purification by overcoming doubt', is 
the 4th of the 7 stages of purification 
(visuddhi, q.v.).

<xa>kappa</xa>
 (Sanskrit kalpa): 'world-period', an 
inconceivably long space of time, an 
aeon. This again is subdivided into 4 
sections: world-dissolution (samvatta-
kappa) dissolving world), continuation 
of the chaos (samvatta-ttha^yi^), world-
formation (vivatta-kappa), continuation 
of the formed world (vivatta-ttha^yi^).
"How long a world-dissolution will 
continue, how long the chaos, how long 
the formation, how long the continuation
 of the formed world, of these things; o
 monks, one hardly can say that it will 
be so many years, or so many centuries, 
or so many millennia, or so many hundred
 thousands of years" (A. IV, 156)
A detailed description of the 4 world-
periods is given in that stirring 
discourse on the all-embracing 
impermanence in A. VII, 62.
The beautiful simile in S. XV, 5 may be 
mentioned here: "Suppose, o monks, there
 was a huge rock of one solid mass, one 
<pb n="218"/>
mile long, one mile wide, one mile high,
 without split or flaw. And at the end 
of every hundred years a man should come
 and rub against it once with a silken 
cloth. Then that huge rock would wear 
off and disappear quicker than a world-
period. But of such world-periods, o 
monks, many have passed away, many 
hundreds, many thousands, many hundred 
thousands. And how is this possible? 
Inconceivable, o monks, is this samsa^ra
 (q.v.), not to be discovered is any 
first beginning of beings, who 
obstructed by ignorance and ensnared by 
craving, are hurrying and hastening 
through this round of rebirths."
Compare here Grimm's German fairy-tale 
of the little shepherdboy: 'In Farther 
Pommerania there is the diamond-mountain
, one hour high, one hour wide, one hour
 deep. There every hundred years a 
little bird comes and whets its little 
beak on it. And when the whole mountain 
is ground off, then the first second of 
eternity has passed."

<xa>karma</xa>
 (Sanskrit), Pa^li: kamma: 'action', 
correctly speaking denotes the wholesome
 and unwholesome volitions (kusala- and 
<pb n="219"/>
akusala-cetana^) and their concomitant 
mental factors, causing rebirth and 
shaping the destiny of beings. These 
karmical volitions (kamma cetana^) 
become manifest as wholesome or 
unwholesome actions by body (ka^ya-kamma
), speech (vaci^-kamma) and mind (mano-
kamma). Thus the Buddhist term 'karma' 
by no means signifies the result of 
actions, and quite certainly not the 
fate of man, or perhaps even of whole 
nations (the so-called wholesale or mass
-karma), misconceptions which, through 
the influence of theosophy, have become 
widely spread in the West.
"Volition (cetana^), o monks, is what I 
call action (cetana^ham bhikkhave kammam
 vada^mi), for through volition one 
performs the action by body, speech or 
mind. . There is karma (action), o monks
, that ripens in hell.... Karma that 
ripens in the animal world.. Karma that 
ripens in the world of men.... Karma 
that ripens in the heavenly world.... 
Threefold, however, is the fruit of 
karma: ripening during the life-time (
dittha-dhamma-vedani^ya-kamma), ripening
 in the next birth (upapajja-vedani^ya-
kamma), ripening in later births (apara^
pariya-vedani^ya kamma) ...." (A.VI, 63)
<pb n="220"/>
.
The 3 conditions or roots (múla, q.v.) 
of unwholesome karma (actions) are greed
, hatred, delusion (lobha, dosa, moha); 
those of wholesome karma are: 
unselfishness (alobha), hatelessness (
adosa = metta^, good-will), 
undeludedness (amoha = pan~n~a^, 
knowledge) .
"Greed, o monks, is a condition for the 
arising of karma; hatred is a condition 
for the arising of karma; delusion is a 
condition for the arising of karma ...."
 (A. III, 109).
"The unwholesome actions are of 3 kinds,
 conditioned by greed, or hate, or 
delusion.
"Killing ... stealing ... unlawful 
sexual intercourse ... lying ... 
slandering ... rude speech ... foolish 
babble, if practised, carried on, and 
frequently cultivated, leads to rebirth 
in hell, or amongst the animals, or 
amongst the ghosts" (A. III, 40). "He 
who kills and is cruel goes either to 
hell or, if reborn as man, will be short
-lived. He who torments others will be 
afflicted with disease. The angry one 
will look ugly, the envious one will be 
without influence, the stingy one will 
<pb n="221"/>
be poor, the stubborn one will be of low
 descent, the indolent one will be 
without knowledge. In the contrary case,
 man will be reborn in heaven or reborn 
as man, he will be long-lived, possessed
 of beauty, influence, noble descent and
 knowledge" (cf. M. 135).
For the above 10-fold wholesome and 
unwholesome course of action, see kamma-
patha. For the 5 heinous crimes with 
immediate result, s. a^nantarika-kamma.
"Owners of their karma are the beings, 
heirs of their karma, their karma is 
their womb from which they are born, 
their karma is their friend, their 
refuge. Whatever karma they perform, 
good or bad, thereof they will be the 
heirs" (M. 135).
With regard to the time of the taking 
place of the karma-result (vipa^ka), one
 distinguishes, as mentioned above, 3 
kinds of karma:
1. karma ripening during the life-time (
dittha-dhamma-vedani^ya kamma);
2. karma ripening in the next birth (
upapajja-vedani^ya-kamma);
3. karma ripening in later births (apara
^pariya-vedani^ya-kamma).
The first two kinds of karma may be 
without karma-result (vipa^ka), if the 
<pb n="222"/>
circumstances required for the taking 
place of the karma-result are missing, 
or if, through the preponderance of 
counteractive karma and their being too 
weak, they are unable to produce any 
result. In this case they are called 
ahosi-kamma, lit. 'karma that has been',
 in other words, ineffectual karma.
The third type of karma, however, which 
bears fruit in later lives, will, 
whenever and wherever there is an 
opportunity, be productive of karma-
result. Before its result has ripened, 
it will never become ineffective as long
 as the life-process is kept going by 
craving and ignorance.
According to the Com., e.g. Vis.M. XIX, 
the 1st of the 7 karmical impulsive-
moments (kamma javana; s. javana) is 
considered as 'karma ripening during the
 life-time', the 7th moment as 'karma 
ripening in the next birth', the 
remaining 5 moments as 'karma ripening 
in later births'.
With regard to their functions one 
distinguishes:
1. regenerative (or productive) karma (
janaka-kamma),
2. supportive (or consolidating) karma (
upatthambhaka-kamma),
<pb n="223"/>
3. counteractive (suppressive or 
frustrating) karma (upapi^laka-kamma),
4. destructive (or supplanting) karma (
upagha^taka- or upacchedaka-kamma).
(1) produces the 5 groups of existence (
corporeality, feeling, perception, 
mental formations, consciousness) at 
rebirth as well as during life-
continuity.
(2) does not produce karma-results but 
is only able to maintain the already 
produced karma-results.
(3) counteracts or suppresses the karma-
results.
(4) destroys the influence of a weaker 
karma and effects only its own result.
With regard to the priority of their 
result one distinguishes:
1. weighty karma (garuka-kamma),
2. habitual karma (a^cinnaka- or bahula-
kamma),
3. death-proximate karma (marana^sanna-
kamma),
4. stored-up karma (katatta^-kamma).
(1, 2) The weighty (garuka) and the 
habitual (bahula) wholesome or 
unwholesome karma are ripening earlier 
than the light and rarely performed 
karma. (3) The death-proximate (marana^
sanna) karma - i.e. the wholesome or 
<pb n="224"/>
unwholesome volition present immediately
 before death, which often may be the 
reflex of some previously performed good
 or evil action (kamma), or of a sign of
 it (kamma-nimitta), or of a sign of the
 future existence (gati-nimitta) - 
produces rebirth. (4) In the absence of 
any of these three actions at the moment
 before death, the stored-up (katatta^) 
karma will produce rebirth.
A real, and in the ultimate sense true, 
understanding of Buddhist karma doctrine
 is possible only through a deep insight
 into the impersonality (s. anatta^) and
 conditionality (s. paticcasamuppa^da, 
paccaya) of all phenomena of existence. 
"Everywhere, in all the forms of 
existence ... such a one is beholding 
merely mental and physical phenomena 
kept going by their being bound up 
through causes and effects.
"No doer does he see behind the deeds, 
no recipient apart from the karma-fruit.
 And with full insight he clearly 
understands that the wise ones are using
 merely conventional terms when, with 
regard to the taking place of any action
, they speak of a doer, or when they 
speak of a receiver of the karma-results
 at their arising. Therefore the ancient
<pb n="225"/>
 masters have said:
'No doer of the deeds is found,
No one who ever reaps their fruits;
Empty phenomena roll on:
This view alone is right and true.
 
'And whilst the deeds and their results
Roll on, based on conditions all,
There no beginning can be seen,
Just as it is with seed and tree.' " (
Vis.M. XIX)
 
Karma (kamma-paccaya) is one of the 24 
conditions (paccaya, q.v.) (App.: Kamma)

<xa>kasina</xa>
  (perhaps related to Sanskrit krtsna, '
all, complete, whole'), is the name for 
a purely external device to produce and 
<pb n="227"/>
develop concentration of mind and attain
 the 4 absorptions (jha^na q.v.). It 
consists in concentrating one's full and
 undivided attention on one visible 
object as preparatory image (parikamma-
nimitta), e.g. a colored spot or disc, 
or a piece of earth, or a pond at some 
distance, etc., until at last one 
perceives, even with the eyes closed, a 
mental reflex, the acquired image (
uggaha-nimitta). Now, while continuing 
to direct one's attention to this image,
 there may arise the spotless and 
immovable counter-image (patibha^ga-
nimitta), and together with it the 
neighbourhood-concentration (upaca^ra-
sama^dhi) will have been reached. While 
still persevering in the concentration 
on the object, one finally will reach a 
state of mind where all sense-activity 
is suspended, where there is no more 
seeing and hearing, no more perception 
of bodily impression and feeling, i.e. 
the state of the 1st mental absorption (
jha^na, q.v.).
The 10 kasinas mentioned in the Suttas 
are: earth-kasina, water, fire, wind, 
blue, yellow, red, white, space, and 
consciousness. "There are 10 kasina-
spheres: someone sees the earth kasina, 
<pb n="228"/>
above, below, on all sides, undivided, 
unbounded .... someone see the water-
kasina, above, below, etc." (M. 77; D. 
33) Cf. abhibha^yatan, bha^vana^; 
further s. Fund. IV.
For space and consciousness-kasina we 
find in Vis.M. V the names limited space
-kasina (paricchinna^ka^sa-kasina; . . .
 s. App. ) and light-kasina (a^loka-
kasina).

<xa>katatta^ kamma</xa>

<xa>ka^ya</xa>
 (lit: accumulation): 'group', 'body', 
may either refer to the physical body (r
úpa-ka^ya) or to the mental body (na^ma-
ka^ya). In the latter case it is either 
a collective name for the mental groups 
(feeling, perception, mental formations,
 consciousness; s. khandha), or merely 
for feeling, perception and a few of the
 mental formations (s. na^ma), e.g. in 
ka^ya-lahuta^, etc. (cf. Tab. II). Ka^ya
 has this same meaning in the standard 
description of the 3rd absorption (jha^
na, q.v.) "and he feels joy in his mind 
<pb n="229"/>
or his mental constitution (ka^ya)", and
 (e.g. Pug. 1-8) of the attainment of 
the 8 deliverances (vimokkha, q.v.); "
having attained the 8 deliverances in 
his mind, or his person (ka^ya)." - Ka^
ya is also the 5th sense-organ, the body
-organ; s. a^yatana, dha^tu, indriya.

<xa>ka^ya gata^ sati</xa>
 'mindfulness with regard to the body', 
refers sometimes (e.g. Vis.M. VIII, 2) 
only to the contemplation on the 32 
parts of the body, sometimes (e.g. M. 
119) to all the various meditations 
comprised under the 'contemplation of 
the body' (ka^ya^nupassana^), the 1st of
 the 4 'foundations of mindfulness' (
satipattha^na, q.v.), consisting partly 
in concentration (sama^dhi) exercises, 
partly in insight (vipassana^) exercises
. On the other hand, the cemetery 
meditations (si^vathika, q.v.) mentioned
 in the Satipattha^na S.(M. 10) are 
nearly the same as the 10 contemplations
 of loathsomeness (asubha-bha^vana^, q.v
.). of Vis.M. VI, whereas elsewhere the 
contemplation on the 32 parts of the 
body is called the 'reflection on 
impurity' (patikkúla-san~n~a^).
In such texts as: 'One thing, o monks, 
<pb n="230"/>
developed and repeatedly practised, 
leads to the attainment of wisdom. It is
 the contemplation on the body' (A.I), 
the reference is to all exercises 
mentioned in the 1st Satipattha^na.
Vis.M. VIII, 2 gives a detailed 
description and explanation of the 
method of developing the contemplation 
on the 32 parts of the body. This 
exercise can produce the 1st absorption 
only (jha^na, q.v.) The stereotype text 
given in the Satipattha^na Sutta and 
elsewhere - but leaving out the brain - 
runs as follows:
"And further, o monks, the monk 
contemplates this body from the soles of
 the feet upward, and from the tops of 
the hairs downward, with skin stretched 
over it, and filled with manifold 
impurities: 'This body has hairs of the 
head, hairs of the body, nails, teeth, 
skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, 
kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen
, lungs, intestines, bowels, stomach, 
excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, 
sweat, fat, tears, skin grease, spittle,
 nasal mucus, oil of the joints, and 
urine ...."
Vis.M. VIII, 2 says "By repeating the 
words of this exercise one will become 
<pb n="231"/>
well acquainted with the wording, the 
mind will not rush here and there, the 
different parts will become distinct and
 appear like a row of fingers, or a row 
of hedge-poles. Now, just as one repeats
 the exercise in words, one should do it
 also in mind. The repeating in mind 
forms the condition for the penetration 
of the characteristic marks.... He who 
thus has examined the parts of the body 
as to colour, shape, region, locality 
and limits, and considers them one by 
one, and not too hurriedly, as something
 loathsome, to such a one, while 
contemplating the body, all these things
 at the same time are appearing 
distinctly clear. But also when keeping 
one's attention fixed outwardly (i.e. to
 the bodies of other beings), and when 
all the parts appear distinctly, then 
all men and animals moving about lose 
the appearance of living beings and 
appear like heaps of many different 
things. And it looks as if those foods 
and drinks, being swallowed by them, 
were being inserted into this heap of 
things. Now, while again and again one 
is conceiving the idea 'Disgusting! 
Disgusting!' - omitting in due course 
several parts - gradually the attainment
<pb n="232"/>
 - concentration (appana^-sama^dhi, i.e.
 the concentration of the jha^na) will 
be reached. In this connection, the 
appearing of forms ... is called the 
acquired image (uggaha-nimitta), the 
arising of loathsomeness, however, the 
counter-image (patibha^ganimitta)."

vimokkha, q.v.), and after wisely 
understanding the phenomena, the cankers
 have partly come to extinction" (Pug. 
32). In A. IX, 44 it is said: "A monk, o
 brother, attains the 1st absorption (
jha^na, q.v.), and as far as this domain
 reaches,- so far he has realized it in 
his own person. Thus the Blessed One 
calls such a person a body-witness in 
certain respects. (The same is then 
repeated with regard to the 7 higher 
absorptions). Further again, o brother, 
the monk attains the extinction of 
perception and feeling (s. nirodha-sama^
patti), and after wisely understanding 
the phenomena, all the cankers come to 
extinction. Thus, o brother, the Blessed
 One calls such a person a body-witness 
in all respects."

<xa>khandha</xa>
  the 5 'groups (of existence)' or '
groups of clinging' (upa^da^nakkhandha);
 alternative renderings: aggregates, 
categories of clinging's objects. These 
are the 5 aspects in which the Buddha 
has summed up all the physical and 
mental phenomena of existence, and which
 appear to the ignorant man as his ego, 
or personality, to wit:
(1) the corporeality group (rúpa-
kkhandha),
(2) the feeling group (vedana^-kkhandha)
,
(3) the perception group (san~n~a^-
kkhandha),
(4) the mental-formation group (sankha^
ra-kkhandha),
(5) the consciousness-group (vin~n~a^na-
kkhandha).
"Whatever there exists of corporeal 
things, whether past, present or future,
 one's own or external, gross or subtle,
 lofty or low, far or near, all that 
belongs to the corporeality group. 
Whatever there exists of feeling ... of 
<pb n="235"/>
perception ... of mental formations ... 
of consciousness ... all that belongs to
 the consciousness-group" (S. XXII, 48).
 - Another division is that into the 2 
groups: mind (2-5) and corporeality (1) 
(na^ma-rúpa), whilst in Dhamma Sangani^,
 the first book of the Abhidhamma, all 
the phenomena are treated by way of 3 
groups: consciousness (5), mental 
factors (2-4), corporeality (1), in Pa^
li citta, cetasika, rúpa. Cf. Guide I.
What is called individual existence is 
in reality nothing but a mere process of
 those mental and physical phenomena, a 
process that since time immemorial has 
been going on, and that also after death
 will still continue for unthinkably 
long periods of time. These 5 groups, 
however, neither singly nor collectively
 constitute any self-dependent real ego-
entity, or personality (atta^), nor is 
there to be found any such entity apart 
from them. Hence the belief in such an 
ego-entity or personality, as real in 
the ultimate sense, proves a mere 
illusion.
"When all constituent parts are there,
The designation 'cart' is used;
Just so, where the five groups exist,
Of 'living being' do we speak." (S. V. 
<pb n="236"/>
10).
The fact ought to be emphasized here 
that these 5 groups, correctly speaking,
 merely form an abstract classification 
by the Buddha, but that they as such, i.
e. as just these 5 complete groups, have
 no real existence, since only single 
representatives of these groups, mostly 
variable, can arise with any state of 
consciousness. For example, with one and
 the same unit of consciousness only one
 single kind of feeling, say joy or 
sorrow, can be associated and never more
 than one. Similarly, two different 
perceptions cannot arise at the same 
moment. Also, of the various kinds of 
sense-cognition or consciousness, only 
one can be present at a time, for 
example, seeing, hearing or inner 
consciousness, etc. Of the 50 mental 
formations, however, a smaller or larger
 number are always associated with every
 state of consciousness, as we shall see
 later on.
Some writers on Buddhism who have not 
understood that the five khandha are 
just classificatory groupings, have 
conceived them as compact entities ('
heaps', 'bundles'), while actually, as 
stated above, the groups never exist as 
<pb n="237"/>
such, i.e. they never occur in a 
simultaneous totality of all their 
constituents. Also those single 
constituents of a group which are 
present in any given body- and -mind 
process, are of an evanescent nature, 
and so also their varying combinations. 
Feeling, perception and mental 
formations are only different aspects 
and functions of a single unit of 
consciousness. They are to consciousness
 what redness, softness, sweetness, etc.
 are to an apple and have as little 
separate existence as those qualities.
In S. XXII, 56, there is the following 
short definition of these 5 groups:
"What, o monks, is the corporeality-
group? The 4 primary elements (maha^-bhú
ta or dha^tu) and corporeality depending
 thereon, this is called the 
corporeality-group.
"What, o monks, is the feeling-group? 
There are 6 classes of feeling: due to 
visual impression, to sound impression, 
to odour impression, to taste impression
, to bodily impression, and to mind 
impression....
"What, o monks, is the perception-group?
 There are 6 classes of perception: 
perception of visual objects, of sounds,
<pb n="238"/>
 of odours, of tastes, of bodily 
impressions, and of mental impressions..
..
"What, o monks, is the group of mental 
formations? There are 6 classes of 
volitional states (cetana^): with regard
 to visual objects, to sounds, to odours
, to tastes, to bodily impressions and 
to mind objects....
"What, o monks, is the consciousness-
group? There are 6 classes of 
consciousness: eye-consciousness, ear-
consciousness, nose-consciousness, 
tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness
, and mind-consciousness."
About the inseparability of the groups 
it is said:
''Whatever, o brother, there exists of 
feeling, of perception and of mental 
formations, these things are associated,
 not dissociated, and it is impossible 
to separate one from the other and show 
their difference. For whatever one feels
, one perceives; and whatever one 
perceives, of this one is conscious" (M.
 43).
Further: "Impossible is it for anyone to
 explain the passing out of one 
existence and the entering into a new 
existence, or the growth, increase and 
<pb n="239"/>
development of consciousness independent
 of corporeality, feeling, perception 
and mental formations" (S. XII, 53)
For the inseparability and mutual 
conditionality of the 4 mental groups s.
 paccaya (6, 7).
Regarding the impersonality (anatta^) 
and emptiness (sun~n~ata^) of the 5 
groups, it is said in S. XXII, 49:
"Whatever there is of corporeality, 
feeling, perception, mental formations 
and consciousness, whether past, present
 or future, one's own or external, gross
 or subtle, lofty or low, far or near, 
this one should understand according to 
reality and true wisdom: 'This does not 
belong to me, this am I not, this is not
 my Ego.' "
Further in S. XXII, 95: "Suppose that a 
man who is not blind were to behold the 
many bubbles on the Ganges as they are 
driving along; and he should watch them 
and carefully examine them. After 
carefully examining them, however, they 
will appear to him empty, unreal and 
unsubstantial. In exactly the same way 
does the monk behold all the corporeal 
phenomena ... feelings ... perceptions .
.. mental formations ... states of 
consciousness, whether they be of the 
<pb n="240"/>
past, present or future ... far or near.
 And he watches them and examines them 
carefully; and after carefully examining
 them, they appear to him empty, unreal 
and unsubstantial."
The 5 groups are compared, respectively,
 to a lump of froth, a bubble, a mirage,
 a coreless plantain stem, and a 
conjuring trick (S. XXII, 95).

SUMMARY OF THE 5 GROUPS
 
I. Corporeality Group
(rúpa-kkhandha)
 
A. Underived (no-upa^da^): 4 elements
 
the solid, or earth-element (pathavi^-
dha^tu)
the liquid, or water-element (a^po-dha^
tu)
heat, or fire-element (tejo-dha^tu)
motion, or wind-element (va^yo-dha^tu)
 
B. Derived (upa^da^): 24 secondary 
phenomena
 
Physical sense-organs of: seeing, 
<pb n="241"/>
hearing, smelling, tasting, body
Physical sense-objects: form, sound, 
odour, taste, (bodily impacts)
'Bodily impacts' (photthabba) are 
generally omitted in this list, because 
these physical objects of body-
sensitivity are identical with the afore
-mentioned solid element, heat and 
motion element. Hence their inclusion 
under 'derived corporeality' would be a 
duplication.

II. Feeling Group
(vedana^-kkhandha)
 
All feelings may, according to their 
nature, be classified as 5 kinds:
bodily agreeable feeling sukha = ka^yika
^ sukha^ vedana^
bodily painful feeling dukkha = ka^yika^
 dukkha^ vedana^
mentally agreeable feeling somanassa = 
cetasika^ sukha^ vedana^
mentally painful feeling domanassa = 
cetasika^ dukkha^ vedana^
indifferent feeling upekkha^ = adukkha-m
-asukha^ vedana^
 
III. Perception Group
(san~n~a^-kkhandha)
 
All perceptions are divided into 6 
classes: perception of form, sound, 
odour, taste, bodily impression, and 
mental impression.
 
IV. Group of Mental Formations
(sankha^ra-kkhandha)
 
This group comprises 50 mental phenomena
<pb n="243"/>
, of which 11 are general psychological 
elements, 25 lofty (sobhana) qualities, 
14 karmically unwholesome qualities. Cf.
 Tab. 11.
 
V. Consciousness Group
(vin~n~a^na-kkhandha)
 
The Suttas divide consciousness, 
according to the senses, into 6 classes:
 eye-, ear-, nose-, tongue-, body-, mind
-consciousness.
The Abhidhamma and commentaries, however
, distinguish, from the karmical or 
moral viewpoint, 89 classes of 
consciousness. Cf. vin~n~a^na and Tab. 1
.
The moral quality of feeling, perception
 and consciousness is determined by the 
mental formations.

 'the celestial beings corruptible by

and thereby become thoughtless, and in 
their thoughtlessness they fall from 
that world (D. 1; 24).

  'defilements', are mind-defiling, 
unwholesome qualities. Vis.M. XXII, 49, 
65: "There are 10 defilements, thus 
called because they are themselves 
defiled, and because they defile the 
<pb n="245"/>
mental factors associated with them. 
They are: (1) greed (lobha), (2) hate (
dosa), (3) delusion (moha), (4) conceit 
(ma^na), (5) speculative views (ditthi),
 (6) skeptical doubt (vicikiccha^), (7) 
mental torpor (thi^na), (8) restlessness
 (uddhacca); (9) shamelessness (ahirika)
, (10) lack of moral dread or 
unconscientiousness (anottappa)." For 1-

 Suttas, though the term occurs quite 
often in them. For the related term, 
upakkilesa (q.v.; 'impurities') 
different lists are given - (App.).

 'sensuality considered as defilement' (
s. kilesa) might well be called '

<xa>kin~cana</xa>
  'something', i.e. something evil that 
sticks or adheres to character. 'Evil 
appendant', is a name for the 3 
unwholesome roots (múla). "There are 3 
appendants: greed (lobha) is an 
appendant, hate (dosa) is an appendant, 
delusion (moha) is an appendant" (D. 33)
. 'Freed from appendants' (akin~cana) is
 a term for the perfectly Holy One (
Arahat).

<xa>kiriya</xa>
 (or kriya)-citta: 'functional 
consciousness' or 'karmically 
inoperative consciousness', is a name 
for such states of consciousness as are 
neither karmically wholesome (kusala), 
nor unwholesome (akusala), nor karma-
results (vipa^ka); that is, they 
function independently of karma. Thus 
are also called all those worldly mental
 states in the Arahat which are 
accompanied by 2 or 3 noble roots (
greedlessness, hatelessness, 
<pb n="247"/>
undeludedness), being in the Arahat 
karmically neutral and corresponding to 
the karmically wholesome states of a non
-Arahat (s. Tab. 1-8 and 73-89), as well
 as the rootless mirth-producing (
hasituppa^da) mind-consciousness-element
 of the Arahat (Tab. 72); further, that 
mind-element (mano-dha^tu) which 
performs the function of advertence (a^
vajjana) to the sense object (Tab. 70), 
and that mind-consciousness-element (
manovin~n~a^na-dha^tu) which performs 
the functions of deciding (votthapana) 
and advertence to the mental object (Tab
. 71). The last-named 2 elements, of 
course, occur in all beings.
Together with karma-resultant 
consciousness (vipa^ka) it belongs to 
the group of 'karmically neutral 
consciousness' (avya^kata). See Tab. I (
last column). - (App.).

<pb n="248"/>

<xa>kriya</xa>
 citta = kiriya (q.v.).

<xa>kukkucca</xa>
  lit. 'wrongly-performed-ness' (ku+krta
+ya), i.e. scruples, remorse, uneasiness
 of conscience, worry, is one of the 
karmically unwholesome (akusala) mental 
faculties (Tab. II) which, whenever it 
arises, is associated with hateful (
discontented) consciousness (Tab. I and 
III, 30, 31). It is the 'repentance over
 wrong things done, and right things 
neglected' (Com. to A. I). Restlessness 
and scruples (uddhacca-kukkucca), 
combined, are counted as one of the 5 
mental hindrances (ni^varana, q.v.).

<xa>kuppa</xa>
 dhamma 'liable to perturbation', is one
 who has not yet attained full mastery 
over the absorptions. In Pug. 3 it is 
said: "What person is liable to 
perturbation? Such a person gains the 
attainments of the fine-material and 
immaterial sphere (s. avacara). But he 
does not gain them at his wish, nor 
without toil and exertion; and not at 
his wish as regards place, object and 
<pb n="249"/>
duration, does he enter them or arise 
from them. Thus it is well possible that
 in case of such a person, through 
negligence, the attainments will become 
perturbed. This person is liable to 
perturbation."

<xa>kusala</xa>
  'karmically wholesome' or 'profitable'
, salutary, morally good, (skillful) 
Connotations of the term, according to 
Com. (Atthasa^lini), are: of good health
, blameless, productive of favourable 
karma-result, skillful. It should be 
noted that Com. excludes the meaning '
skillful', when the term is applied to 
states of consciousness.
It is defined in M. 9 as the 10 
wholesome courses of action (s. 
kammapatha). In psychological terms, '
karmically wholesome' are all those 
karmical volitions (kamma-cetana^) and 
the consciousness and mental factors 
associated therewith, which are 
accompanied by 2 or 3 wholesome roots (s
. múla), i.e. by greedlessness (alobha) 
and hatelessness (adosa), and in some 
cases also by non-delusion (amoha: 
wisdom, understanding). Such states of 
consciousness are regarded as '
<pb n="250"/>
karmically wholesome' as they are causes
 of favourable karma results and contain
 the seeds of a happy destiny or rebirth
. From this explanation, two facts 
should be noted: (1) it is volition that
 makes a state of consciousness, or an 
act, 'good' or 'bad'; (2) the moral 
criterion in Buddhism is the presence or
 absence of the 3 wholesome or moral 
roots (s. múla).
The above explanations refer to mundane 
(lokiya, q.v.) wholesome consciousness. 
Supermundane wholesome (lokuttara-kusala
) states, i.e. the four paths of 
sanctity (s. ariyapuggala), have as 
results only the corresponding four 
fruitions; they do not constitute karma,
 nor do they lead to rebirth, and this 
applies also to the good actions of an 
Arahat (Tab. I, 73-80) and his 
meditative states (Tab. 1, 81-89), which
 are all karmically inoperative (
functional; s. kiriya).
Kusala belongs to a threefold division 
of all consciousness, as found in the 
Abhidhamma (Dhs.), into wholesome (
kusala), unwholesome (akusala) and 
karmically neutral (avya^kata), which is
 the first of the triads (tika) in the 
Abhidhamma schedule (ma^tika^); s. Guide

<xa>loka</xa>
  'world', denotes the 3 spheres of 
existence comprising the whole universe,
 i.e. (1) the sensuous world (ka^ma-loka
), or the world of the 5 senses; (2) the
 fine-material world (rúpa-loka), 
corresponding to the 4 fine-material 
absorptions (s. jha^na 1-4); (3) the 
immaterial world (arúpa-loka), 
corresponding to the 4 immaterial 
absorptions (s. jha^na, 5-8).
The sensuous world comprises the hells (
niraya), the animal kingdom (tiraccha^na
-yoni), the ghost-realm (peta-loka), the
 demon world (asura-nika^ya), the human 
world (manussa-loka) and the 6 lower 
celestial worlds (s. deva I). In the 
fine-material world (s. deva II) still 
<pb n="254"/>
exist the faculties of seeing and 
hearing, which, together with the other 
sense faculties, are temporarily 
suspended in the 4 absorptions. In the 
immaterial world (s. deva III) there is 
no corporeality whatsoever, only the 
four mental groups (s. khandha) exist 
there.
Though the term loka is not applied in 
the Suttas to those 3 worlds, but only 
the term bhava, 'existence' (e.g. M. 43)
, there is no doubt that the teaching 
about the 3 worlds belongs to the 
earliest, i.e. sutta-period, of the 
Buddhist scriptures, as many relevant 
passages show.

<xa>loka dhamma</xa>
 'worldly conditions'. "Eight things are
 called worldly conditions, since they 
arise in connection with worldly life, 
namely: gain and loss, honour and 
dishonour, happiness and misery, praise 
and blame" (Vis.M. XXII). Cf. also A. 
VIII, 5.

<xa>lokiya</xa>
  'mundane', are all those states of

. 56).

<xa>mada</xa>
  'infatuation'. "Infatuation is of 3 
kinds: youth-infatuation, health-
infatuation, life-infatuation" (D. 33). 
"Infatuated by youth-infatuation, by 
health-infatuation and by life-
infatuation, the ignorant worldling 
pursues an evil course in bodily actions
, speech and thought, and thereby, at 
the dissolution of the body, after death
, passes to a lower world, to a woeful 
course of existence, to a state of 
suffering and hell" (A. III, 39).

<xa>magga</xa>
  'path'. 1. For the 4 supermundane 
paths (lokuttara-magga), s. ariya-
puggala - 2. The Eightfold Path (
atthangika-magga) is the path leading to
 the extinction of suffering, i.e. the 
last of the 4 Noble Truths (sacca, q.v.)
, namely:
 
Wisdom (pan~n~a^) III.
<pb n="257"/>
1. Right view (samma^-ditthi)
2. Right thought (samma^-sankappa)
Morality (si^la) I.
3. Right speech (samma^-va^ca^)
4. Right bodily action (samma^-kammanta)
5. Right livelihood (samma^-a^ji^va)
Concentration (sama^dhi) II.
6. Right effort (samma^-va^ya^ma)
7. Right mindfulness (samma^-sati)
8. Right concentration (samma^-sama^dhi)
 
1. Right view or right understanding (
samma^-ditthi) is the understanding of 
the 4 Noble Truths about the 
universality of suffering (
unsatisfactoriness), of its origin, its 
cessation, and the path leading to that 
cessation. - See the Discourse on 'Right
 Understanding' (M. 9, tr. and Com. in '
R. Und.').
2. Right thought (samma^-sankappa): 
thoughts free from sensuous desire, from
 ill-will, and cruelty.
3. Right speech (samma^-va^ca^): 
abstaining from lying, tale-bearing, 
harsh language, and foolish babble.
4 Right bodily action (samma^-kammanta):
 abstaining from killing, stealing, and 
unlawful sexual intercourse.
5. Right livelihood (samma^-a^ji^va): 
<pb n="258"/>
abstaining from a livelihood that brings
 harm to other beings, such as trading 
in arms, in living beings, intoxicating 
drinks, poison; slaughtering, fishing, 
soldiering, deceit, treachery 
soothsaying, trickery, usury, etc.
6. Right effort (samma^-va^ya^ma): the 
effort of avoiding or overcoming evil 
and unwholesome things, and of 
developing and maintaining wholesome 
things (s. padha^na).
7. Right mindfulness (samma^-sati): 
mindfulness and awareness in 
contemplating body, feelings, mind, and 
mind-objects (s. sati, satipattha^na).
8. Right concentration (samma^-sama^dhi)
: concentration of mind associated with 
wholesome (kusala) consciousness, which 
eventually may reach the absorptions (
jha^na, q.v.). Cf. sama^dhi.
There are to be distinguished 2 kinds of
 concentration, mundane (lokiya) and 
supermundane (lokuttara) concentration. 
The latter is associated with those 
states of consciousness known as the 4 
supermundane paths and fruitions (s. 
ariya-puggala). As it is said in M. 117:
"I tell you, o monks, there are 2 kinds 
of right view: the understanding that it
 is good to give alms and offerings, 
<pb n="259"/>
that both good and evil actions will 
bear fruit and will be followed by 
results.... This, o monks, is a view 
which, though still subject to the 
cankers, is meritorious, yields worldly 
fruits, and brings good results. But 
whatever there is of wisdom, of 
penetration, of right view conjoined 
with the path - the holy path being 
pursued, this is called the supermundane
 right view (lokuttara-samma^-ditthi), 
which is not of the world, but which is 
supermundane and conjoined with the path
."
In a similar way the remaining links of 
the path are to be understood.
As many of those who have written about 
the Eightfold Path have misunderstood 
its true nature, it is therefore 
appropriate to add here a few 
elucidating remarks about it, as this 
path is fundamental for the 
understanding and practice of the Buddha
's .teaching.
First of all, the figurative expression 
'path' should not be interpreted to mean
 that one has to advance step by step in
 the sequence of the enumeration until, 
after successively passing through all 
the eight stages, one finally may reach 
<pb n="260"/>
one's destination, Nibba^na. If this 
really were the case, one should have 
realized, first of all, right view and 
penetration of the truth, even before 
one could hope to proceed to the next 
steps, right thought and right speech; 
and each preceding stage would be the 
indispensable foundation and condition 
for each succeeding stage. In reality, 
however, the links 3-5 constituting 
moral training (si^la), are the first 3 
links to be cultivated, then the links 6
-8 constituting mental training (sama^
dhi), and at last right view, etc. 
constituting wisdom (pan~n~a^).
It is, however, true that a really 
unshakable and safe foundation to the 
path is provided only by right view 
which, starting from the tiniest germ of
 faith and knowledge, gradually, step by
 step, develops into penetrating insight
 (vipassana^) and thus forms the 
immediate condition for the entrance 
into the 4 supermundane paths and fruits
 of holiness, and for the realization of
 Nibba^na. Only with regard to this 
highest form of supermundane insight, 
may we indeed say that all the remaining
 links of the path are nothing but the 
outcome and the accompaniments of right 
<pb n="261"/>
view.
Regarding the mundane (lokiya) eightfold
 path, however, its links may arise 
without the first link, right view.
Here it must also be emphasized that the
 links of the path not only do not arise
 one after the other, as already 
indicated, but also that they, at least 
in part, arise simultaneously as 
inseparably associated mental factors in
 one and the same state of consciousness
. Thus, for instance, under all 
circumstances at least 4 links are 
inseparably bound up with any karmically
 wholesome consciousness, namely 2, 6, 7
 and 8, i.e. right thought, right effort
, right mindfulness and right 
concentration (M. 117), so that as soon 
as any one of these links arises, the 
three others also do so. On the other 
hand, right view is not necessarily 
present in every wholesome state of 
consciousness.

paccaya 18).

To give oneself up to indulgence in 
sensual pleasure (ka^ma-sukha), the base
, common, vulgar, unholy, unprofitable; 
and also to give oneself up to self-
torment (atta-kilamatha), the painful, 
<pb n="264"/>
unholy, unprofitable, both these two 
extremes the Perfect One has avoided and
 has found the Middle Path (s. magga), 
which causes one both to see and to know
, and which leads to peace, to 
discernment, to enlightenment, to Nibba^
na. It is the Noble Eightfold Path, the 
way that leads to the extinction of

inferiority-conceit (oma^na) and the 
<pb n="265"/>
superiority-conceit (atima^na): this 
threefold conceit should be overcome. 
For, after overcoming this threefold 
conceit, the monk, through the full 
penetration of conceit, is said to have 
put an end suffering" (A. VI, 49).
"Those ascetics and brahman priests who,
 relying on this impermanent, miserable 
and transitory nature of corporeality, 
feelings, perceptions, mental formations

these imagine thus through not 
understanding reality" (S. XXII, 49).
In reality no ego-entity is to be found.

the 7 mental factors (cetasika) that are
 inseparably associated with all states 
of consciousness (s. cetana^). In M. 9, 
it is given as one of the factors 
representative of mind (na^ma) It is the
 mind's first 'confrontation with an 
object' and 'binds the associated mental
<pb n="266"/>
 factors to the object.' It is, 
therefore, the prominent factor in two 
specific classes of consciousness: i.e. 
'advertence (a^vajjana, q.v.) at the 
five sense-doors' (Tab. I, 70) and at 
the mind-door (Tab. I, 71). These two 
states of consciousness, breaking 
through the subconscious life-continuum 
(bhavanga), form the first stage in the 
perceptual process (citta-vi^thi; s. vin
~n~a^na-kicca). See Vis.M. XIV, 152.
2. In a more general sense, the term 
appears frequently in the Suttas as 
yoniso-manasika^ra, 'wise (or reasoned, 
methodical) attention' or 'wise 
reflection'. It is said, in M. 2, to 
counteract the cankers (a^sava, q.v.); 
it is a condition for the arising of 
right view (s. M. 43), of Stream-entry (
s. sota^pattiyanga), and of the factors 
of enlightenment (s. S. XLVI, 2.49,51). 
- 'Unwise attention' (ayoniso-manasika^
ra) leads to the arising of the cankers 
(s. M. 2) and of the five hindrances (s.
 S. XLVI, 2.51).

<xa>mana^yatana</xa>
  'mind-base', is a collective term for 
all the different states of 
consciousness; s. a^yatana.
<pb n="267"/>

<xa>mangala</xa>
  means, in general usage, anything 
regarded as 'auspicious' 'lucky', or a '
good omen'. Against the contemporary 
superstitions notions about it, the 
Buddha, in the Maha^-mangala Sutta (Sn.,
 w. 258 ff.), set forth 36 'blessings' 
that are truly auspicious, i.e. 
conducive to happiness, beginning with 
the 'avoidance of bad company' and 
ending with a 'serene mind'. It is one 
of the most popular Suttas in Buddhist 
countries, and a fundamental text on 
Buddhist lay ethics.

<xa>mano</xa>
  'mind', is in the Abhidhamma used as 
synonym of vin~n~a^na (consciousness) 
and citta (state of consciousness, mind)
. According to the Com. to Vis.M., it 
sometimes means sub-consciousness (s. 
bhavanga-sota).

<xa>mano dha^tu</xa>
 'mind-element', is one of the 18 
elements (s. dha^tu II). This term, 
<pb n="268"/>
unlike mana^yatana, does not apply to 
the whole of consciousness, but 
designates only that special element of 
consciousness which first, at the 
beginning of the process of sense-
perception, performs the function of 
advertence (a^vajjana; Tab. I, 70) to 
the sense-object and, then after twice 
having become conscious of it performs 
the function of reception (sampaticchana
; Tab I- 39,.55) into mind-consciousness
. See vin~n~a^na-kicca.

<xa>mano kamma</xa>
 'mental action'; s. karma, kammapatha.

<xa>manomaya^ iddhi</xa>
 s. iddhi.

<xa>manopadosika deva</xa>
 'the celestial beings corruptible by 
temper', are a class of devas (q.v.) of 
the sensuous sphere. "They spend their 
time in becoming annoyed with one 
another, and getting into a temper, and 
thus by being bodily and mentally 
exhausted, they pass from that world" (D
. 1; 24).

<xa>manopavica^ra</xa>
<pb n="269"/>
  'mental indulging'. There are 
mentioned 18 ways of indulging: 6 in 
gladness (somanassúpavica^ra), 6 in 
sorrow (domanassa), 6 in indifference (
upekkha^). "Perceiving with the eye a 
visible form ... hearing with the ear a 
sound ... being in mind conscious of an 
object, one indulges in the joy-
producing object, the sorrow-producing 
object, the indifference-producing 
object... " (M. 137; A. III, 61). - In 
the Com. to A., upavica^ra is said to be
 identical with vitakka-vica^ra (q.v.).

<xa>mano san~cetana^</xa>
 'mental volition'; s. a^ha^ra.

<xa>manovinn~a^na dha^tu</xa>
 'mind-consciousness element', one of 
the 18 'elements' (s. dha^tu II). This 
term is generally used as a name for 
that consciousness-element which 
performs the functions of investigation 
(santi^rana), determining (votthapana), 
registering (tada^rammana), etc. See Tab
. I, 40, 41, 56, 71, 72.

<xa>Ma^ra</xa>
  (lit. 'the killer'), is the Buddhist '
Tempter-figure. He is often called 'Ma^
<pb n="270"/>
ra the Evil One' (pa^pima^ ma^ro) or 
Namuci (lit. 'the non-liberator', i.e. 
the opponent of liberation). He appears 
in the texts both as a real person (i.e.
 as a deity) and as personification of 
evil and passions, of the totality of 
worldly existence, and of death. Later 
Pa^li literature often speaks of a '
fivefold Ma^ra' (pan~ca-ma^ra): 1. M. as
 a deity (devaputta-ma^ra), 2. the M. of
 defilements (kilesa-m.), 3. the M. of 
the aggregates (khandha-m.), 4. the M. 
of the karma-formations (kamma-m.), and 
5. Ma^ra as death (maccu-m.).
As a real person, M. is regarded as the 
deity ruling over the highest heaven of 
the sensuous sphere (ka^ma^vacara), that
 of the paranimmitavasavatti-devas, the 
'deities wielding power over the 
creations of others' (Com. to M. 1). 
According to tradition, when the 
Bodhisatta was seated under the Bodhi-
tree, Ma^ra tried in vain to obstruct 
his attainment of Enlightenment, first 
by frightening him through his hosts of 
demons, etc., and then by his 3 
daughters' allurements. This episode is 
called 'Ma^ra's war' (ma^ra-yuddha). For
 7 years M. had followed the Buddha, 
looking for any weakness in him; that is
<pb n="271"/>
, 6 years before the Enlightenment and 
one year after it (Sn. v. 446). He also 
tried to induce the Buddha to pass away 
into Parinibba^na without proclaiming 
the Dhamma, and also when the time for 
the Buddha's Parinibba^na had come, he 
urged him on. But the Buddha acted on 
his own insight in both cases. See D. 16
.
For (3) M. as the aggregates, s. S. 
XXIII, 1, 11, 12, 23. See Padha^na Sutta
 (Sn. v. 425ff.); Ma^ra Samyutta (S. IV)
.

<xa>marana</xa>
  'death', in ordinary usage, means the 
disappearance of the vital faculty 
confined to a single life-time, and 
therewith of the psycho-physical life-
process conventionally called 'man, 
animal, personality, ego', etc. Strictly
 speaking, however, death is the 
continually repeated dissolution and 
vanishing of each momentary physical-
mental combination, and thus it takes 
place every moment. About this 
momentaneity of existence, it is said in
 Vis.M. VIII:
"In the absolute sense, beings have only
 a very short moment to live, life 
<pb n="272"/>
lasting as long as a single moment of 
consciousness lasts. Just as a cart-
wheel, whether rolling or whether at a 
standstill, at all times only rests on a
 single point of its periphery, even so 
the life of a living being lasts only 
for the duration of a single moment of 
consciousness. As soon as that moment 
ceases, the being also ceases. For it is
 said: 'The being of the past moment of 
consciousness has lived, but does not 
live now, nor will it live in future. 
The being of the future moment has not 
yet lived, nor does it live now, but it 
will live in the future. The being of 
the present moment has not lived, it 
does live just now, but it will not live
 in the future.' "
In another sense, the coming to an end 
of the psycho-physical life-process of 
the Arahat, or perfectly Holy One, at 
the moment of his passing away may be 
called the final and ultimate death, as 
up to that moment the psycho-physical 
life-process was still going on from 
life to life.
Death, in the ordinary sense, combined 
with old age, forms the 12th link in the
 formula of dependent origination (
paticca-samuppa^da q.v.).
<pb n="273"/>

consciousness, s. vin~n~a^na-kicca.

<xa>marana^nussati</xa>
  'recollection of death', is one of the
 10 recollections treated in detail in 
Vis.M. VIII:
''Recollection of death, developed and 
frequently practised, yields great 
reward, great blessing, has 
Deathlessness as its goal and object. 
But how may such recollection be 
developed?
"As soon as the day declines, or as the 
night vanishes and the day is breaking, 
the monk thus reflects: 'Truly, there 
are many possibilities for me to die: I 
may be bitten by a serpent, or be stung 
by a scorpion or a centipede, and 
thereby I may lose my life. But this 
would be an obstacle for me. Or I may 
stumble and fall to the ground, or the 
food eaten by me may not agree with my 
health; or bile, phlegm and piercing 
body gases may become disturbing, or men
 or ghosts may attack me, and thus I may
<pb n="274"/>
 lose my life. But this would be an 
obstacle for me.' Then the monk has to 
consider thus: 'Are there still to be 
found in me unsubdued evil, unwholesome 
things which, if I should die today or 
tonight, might lead me to suffering?' 
Now, if he understands that this is the 
case, he should use his utmost 
resolution, energy, effort, endeavour, 
steadfastness, attentiveness and clear-
mindedness in order to overcome these 
evil, unwholesome things" (A VIII, 74).
In Vis.M. VIII it is said: 'He who 
wishes to develop this meditation, 
should retreat to solitude, and whilst 
living secluded he should thus wisely 
reflect: 'Death will come to me! The 
vital energy will be cut off!' Or: '
Death! Death!' To him, namely, who does 
not wisely reflect, sorrow may arise by 
thinking on the death of a beloved 
person, just as to a mother whilst 
thinking on the death of her beloved 
child. Again, by reflecting on the death
 of a disliked person, joy may arise, 
just as to enemies whilst thinking on 
the death of their enemies. Through 
thinking on the death of an indifferent 
person, however, no emotion will arise, 
just as to a man whose work consists in 
<pb n="275"/>
cremating the dead at the sight of a 
dead body. And by reflecting on one's 
own death fright may arise ... just as 
at the sight of a murderer with drawn 
sword one becomes filled with horror. 
Thus, whenever seeing here or there 
slain or other dead beings, one should 
reflect on the death of such deceased 
persons who once lived in happiness, and
 one should rouse one's attentiveness, 
emotion and knowledge and consider thus:
 'Death will come, etc.' .... Only in 
him who considers in this way, will the 
hindrances (ni^varana, q.v.) be 
repressed; and through the idea of death
 attention becomes steadfast, and the 
exercise reaches neighbourhood-
concentration (upaca^ra-sama^dhi)."
According to Vis.M. VIII, one may also 
reflect on death in the following 
various ways: one may think of it as a 
murderer with a drawn sword standing in 
front of oneself; or one may bear in 
mind that all happiness ends in death; 
or that even the mightiest beings on 
this earth are subject to death; or that
 we must share this body with all those 
innumerable worms and other tiny beings 
residing therein; or that life is 
something dependent on in-and-out 
<pb n="276"/>
breathing, and bound up with it; or that
 life continues only as long as the 
elements, food, breath, etc. are 
properly performing their functions; or 
that nobody knows when, where, and under
 what circumstances, death will take 
place, and what kind of fate we have to 
expect after death; or, that life is 
very short and limited. As it is said: '
Short, indeed, is this life of men, 
limited, fleeting, full or woe and 
torment; it is just like a dewdrop that 
vanishes as soon as the sun rises; like 
a water-bubble; like a furrow drawn in 
the water; like a torrent dragging 
everything along and never standing 
still; like cattle for slaughter that 
every moment look death in the face" (A.
 VII, 74).
"The monk devoted to this recollection 
of death is at all time indefatigable, 
gains the idea of disgust with regard to
 all forms of existence, gives up 
delight in life, detests evil, does not 
hoard up things, is free from stinginess
 with regard to the necessities of life,
 the idea of impermanence (anicca) 
becomes familiar to him; and through 
pursuing it, the idea of misery (dukkha)
 and of impersonality (anatta^) become 
<pb n="277"/>
present to him .... Free from fear and 
bewilderment will he pass away at death;
 and should he not yet realize the 
Deathless State in his life-time, he 
will at the dissolution of the body 
attain to a happy course of existence" (
Vis.M. VIII).

 eating. Just as the karmical, i.e. 
moral, quality of any action is 
determined by the quality of volition (

independently of this volition nothing 
whatever can be called karmically 
wholesome or unwholesome (kusala,

external act of meat-eating, this being 
as such purely non-moral, i.e. 
karmically neutral (avya^kata).
'In 3 circumstances meat-eating is to be
 rejected: if one has seen, or heard, or
 suspects (that the animal has been 
slaughtered expressly for one's own sake
)" (M. 55). For if in such a case one 
should partake of the meat, one would as
 it were approve the murder of animals, 
and thus encourage the animal-murderer 
in his murderous deeds. Besides, that 
the Buddha never objected, in ordinary 
circumstances, to meat-eating may be 
clearly understood from many passages of
<pb n="279"/>
 the Suttas (e.g. A. V. 44; VIII, 12; M.
 55, etc.), as also from the Vinaya, 
where it is related that the Buddha 
firmly rejected Devadatta's proposal to 
forbid meat-eating to the monks; further
 from the fact that 10 kinds of meat 
were (for merely external reasons) 
forbidden to the monks, namely from 
elephants, tigers, serpents, etc.

<xa>múla</xa>
  'roots', also called hetu (q.v.; s. 
paccaya, 1), are those conditions which 
through their presence determine the 
actual moral quality of a volitional 
state (cetana^), and the consciousness 
and mental factors associated therewith,
 in other words, the quality of karma (q
.v.). There are 6 such roots, 3 
karmically wholesome and 3 unwholesome 
roots, viz.,: greed, hate, delusion (
lobha, dosa, moha), and greedlessness, 
hatelessness, undeludedness (alobha, 
adosa, amoha).
In A. III, 68 it is said that greed 
arises through unwise reflection on an 
attractive object, hate through unwise 
reflection on a repulsive object. Thus, 
greed (lobha or ra^ga) comprises all 
degrees of 'attractedness' towards an 
object from the faintest trace of a 
longing thought up to grossest egoism, 
whilst hatred (dosa) comprises all 
degrees of 'repulsion' from the faintest
 trace of ill-humor up to the highest 
pitch of hate and wrath.
The 3 wholesome (kusala) roots, 
greedlessness, etc., though expressed in
 negative terms, nevertheless possess a 
distinctly positive character, just as 
<pb n="286"/>
is also often the case with negative 
terms in other languages, for example, 
the negative term 'immorality', which 
has a decidedly positive character.
Thus, greedlessness (alobha) is a name 
for unselfishness, liberality, etc., 
hatelessness (adosa) for kindness or 
goodwill (metta^), undeludedness (amoha)
 for wisdom (pan~n~a^).
"The perception of impurity is to be 
developed in order to overcome greed (
lust); loving-kindness in order to 
overcome hate; wisdom in order to 
overcome delusion" (A. VI, 107).
"Killing, stealing, unlawful sexual 
intercourse, lying, tale-bearing, harsh 
language, frivolous talk, covetousness, 
ill-will and wrong views (s. kammapatha)
, these things are due either to greed, 
or hate, or delusion" (A. X, 174).
"Enraptured with lust (greed), enraged 
with hate, blinded by delusion, 
overwhelmed, with mind ensnared, man 
aims at his own ruin, at others' ruin, 
at the ruin of both, and he experiences 
mental pain and grief. And he follows 
evil ways in deeds, words and thought...
 And he really knows neither his own 
welfare, nor the welfare of others, nor 
the welfare of both. These things make 
<pb n="287"/>
him blind and ignorant, hinder his 
knowledge, are painful, and do not lead 
him to peace."
The presence or absence of the 3 
unwholesome roots forms part of the mind
 contemplation in the Satipattha^na 
Sutta (M. 10). They are also used for 
the classification of unwholesome 
consciousness (s. Tab. I).

perception (san~n~a^), mental formations
 (sankha^ra) and consciousness (vin~n~a^
na). Within the 4th link (na^ma-rúpa) in
<pb n="288"/>
 the formula of the paticcasamuppa^da (q
.v.), however, it applies only to karma-
resultant (vipa^ka) feeling and 
perception and a few karma-resultant 
mental functions inseparable from any 
consciousness. As it is said (M. 9; D. 
15; S. XII, 2): "Feeling (vedana^), 
perception (san~n~a^), volition (cetana^
), impression (phassa), mental 
advertence (manasika^ra): this, o 
brother, is called mind (na^ma)." With 
the addition of 2 more mental factors, 
namely, mental vitality (ji^vita) and 
concentration (sama^dhi), here '
stationary phase of mind' (cittatthiti),
 these 7 factors are said in the 
Abhidhammattha Sangaha to be the 
inseparable mental factors in any state 
of consciousness.

mental formations of the sankha^ra-
kkhandha (not including feeling and 
perception), s. Tab. II.

<xa>na^ma ka^ya</xa>
 the 'mind-group' (as distinguished from
 rúpa-ka^ya, the corporeality-group) 
comprises the 4 immaterial groups of 
existence (arúpino khandha^; s. khandha)
. This twofold grouping, frequent in Com
<pb n="289"/>
., occurs first in D. 15, also in Pts.M.
 (I, 183); na^ma-ka^ya alone is 
mentioned in Sn. 1074.

<xa>na^ma</xa>
 rúpa (lit. 'name and form'): 'mind-and-

 the 4th link in the dependent 
origination (s. paticcasamuppa^da 3, 4) 
where it is conditioned by consciousness
, and on its part is the condition of 
the sixfold sense-base. In two texts (D.
 14, 15), which contain variations of 
the dependent origination, the mutual 
conditioning of consciousness and mind-
and-body is described (see also S. XII, 
67), and the latter is said to be a 
condition of sense-impression (phassa); 
so also in Sn. 872.
The third of the seven purifications (s.
 visuddhi), the purification of views, 
is defined in Vis.M. XVIII as the "
correct seeing of mind-and-body," and 
various methods for the discernment of 
mind-and-body by way of insight-
meditation (vipassana^, q.v.) are given 
there. In this context, 'mind' (na^ma) 
comprises all four mental groups, 
including consciousness. - See na^ma.
In five-group-existence (pan~ca-voka^ra-
<pb n="290"/>
bhava, q.v.), mind-and body are 
inseparable and interdependent; and this
 has been illustrated by comparing them 
with two sheaves of reeds propped 
against each other: when one falls the 
other will fall, too; and with a blind 
man with stout legs, carrying on his 
shoulders a lame cripple with keen eye-
sight: only by mutual assistance can 
they move about efficiently (s. Vis.M. 
XVIII, 32ff). On their mutual dependence
, see also paticca-samuppa^da (3).
With regard to the impersonality and 
dependent nature of mind and 
corporeality it is said:
"Sound is not a thing that dwells inside
 the conch-shell and comes out from time
 to time, but due to both, the conch-
shell and the man that blows it, sound 
comes to arise: Just so, due to the 
presence of vitality, heat and 
consciousness, this body may execute the
 acts of going, standing, sitting and 
lying down, and the 5 sense-organs and 
the mind may perform their various 
functions" (D. 23).
"Just as a wooden puppet though 
unsubstantial, lifeless and inactive may
 by means of pulling strings be made to 
move about, stand up, and appear full of
<pb n="291"/>
 life and activity; just so are mind and
 body, as such, something empty, 
lifeless and inactive; but by means of 
their mutual working together, this 
mental and bodily combination may move 
about, stand up, and appear full of life
 and activity."

 path of Stream-winning, Once-returning,
 Non-returning or Arahatship. Vis.M. 
XXII furnishes a detailed explanation of
 it (s. visuddhi, VII).

state, which is surpassed only by the 
state of complete suspense of

wisdom, on the level of the first 3 
paths of sanctity, nor has he completed 
his training as an Arahat. See sekha. -

<xa>neyyattha dhamma</xa>
 A 'teaching the meaning of which is 
implicit, or has to be inferred' as 
contrasted with a 'teaching with an 
explicit or evident meaning' (ni^tattha-
dhamma). In A. I, 60 (PTS) it is said: "
Whoso declares a sutta with an implicit 
meaning as a sutta with explicit meaning
 (and conversely), such a one makes a 
false statement with regard to the 
Blessed One." - See paramattha.

<xa>Nibba^na</xa>
  (Sanskrit nirva^na): lit. 'extinction'
 (nir + ? va, to cease blowing, to 
become extinguished); according to the 
commentaries, 'freedom from desire' (nir
+ vana). Nibba^na constitutes the 
highest and ultimate goal of all 
<pb n="296"/>
Buddhist aspirations, i.e. absolute 
extinction of that life-affirming will 
manifested as greed, hate and delusion, 
and convulsively clinging to existence; 
and therewith also the ultimate and 
absolute deliverance from all future 
rebirth, old age, disease and death, 
from all suffering and misery. Cf. 
Parinibba^na.
"Extinction of greed, extinction of hate
, extinction of delusion: this is called
 Nibba^na" (S. XXXVIII. 1).
The 2 aspects of Nibba^na are:
(1) The full extinction of defilements (
kilesa-parinibba^na), also called sa-upa
^di-sesa-nibba^na (s. It. 41), i.e. '
Nibba^na with the groups of existence 
still remaining' (s. upa^di). This takes
 place at the attainment of Arahatship, 
or perfect holiness (s. ariya-puggala).
(2) The full extinction of the groups of
 existence (khandha-parinibba^na), also 
called an-upa^di-sesa-nibba^na (s. It. 
41, A. IV, 118), i.e. 'Nibba^na without 
the groups remaining', in other words, 
the coming to rest, or rather the 'no-
more-continuing' of this physico-mental 
process of existence. This takes place 
at the death of the Arahat. - (App.: 
Nibba^na).
<pb n="297"/>
Sometimes both aspects take place at one
 and the same moment, i.e. at the death 
of the Arahat; s. sama-si^si^.
"This, o monks, truly is the peace, this
 is the highest, namely the end of all 
formations, the forsaking of every 
substratum of rebirth, the fading away 
of craving, detachment, extinction, 
Nibba^na" (A. III, 32).
"Enraptured with lust (ra^ga), enraged 
with anger (dosa), blinded by delusion (
moha), overwhelmed, with mind ensnared, 
man aims at his own ruin, at the ruin of
 others, at the ruin of both, and he 
experiences mental pain and grief. But 
if lust, anger and delusion are given up
, man aims neither at his own ruin, nor 
at the ruin of others, nor at the ruin 
of both, and he experiences no mental 
pain and grief. Thus is Nibba^na visible
 in this life, immediate, inviting, 
attractive, and comprehensible to the 
wise" (A. III, 55).
"Just as a rock of one solid mass 
remains unshaken by the wind, even so 
neither visible forms, nor sounds, nor 
odours, nor tastes, nor bodily 
impressions, neither the desired nor the
 undesired, can cause such a one to 
waver. Steadfast is his mind, gained is 
<pb n="298"/>
deliverance" (A, VI, 55).
"Verily, there is an Unborn, 
Unoriginated, Uncreated, Unformed. If 
there were not this Unborn, Unoriginated
, Uncreated, Unformed, escape from the 
world of the born, the originated, the 
created, the formed, would not be 
possible" (Ud. VIII, 3).
One cannot too often and too 
emphatically stress the fact that not 
only for the actual realization of the 
goal of Nibba^na, but also for a 
theoretical understanding of it, it is 
an indispensable preliminary condition 
to grasp fully the truth of anatta^ (q.v
.), the egolessness and insubstantiality
 of all forms of existence. Without such
 an understanding, one will necessarily 
misconceive Nibba^na - according to one'
s either materialistic or metaphysical 
leanings - either as annihilation of an 
ego, or as an eternal state of existence
 into which an ego or self enters or 
with which it merges. Hence it is said:
"Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is 
found;
The deed is, but no doer of the deed is 
there;
Nibba^na is, but not the man that enters
 it;
<pb n="299"/>
The path is, but no traveler on it is 
seen."
(Vis.M. XVI)

<xa>nimitta</xa>
  mark, sign; image; target, object; 
cause, condition. These meanings are 
used in, and adapted to, many contexts 
of which only the doctrinal ones are 
mentioned here.
1. 'Mental (reflex-) image', obtained in
 meditation. In full clarity, it will 
appear in the mind by successful 
practice of certain concentration-
exercises and will then appear as 
vividly as if seen by the eye. The 
object perceived at the very beginning 
of concentration is called the 
preparatory image (parikamma-nimitta). 
The still unsteady and unclear image, 
which arises when the mind has reached a
 weak degree of concentration, is called
 the acquired image (uggaha-nimitta). An
 entirely clear and immovable image 
arising at a higher degree of 
<pb n="301"/>
concentration is the counter-image (
patibha^ga-nimitta). As soon as this 
image arises, the stage of neighbourhood
 (or access) concentration (upaca^ra-
sama^dhi) is reached. For further 
details, s. kasina, sama^dhi.
2. 'Sign of (previous) kamma' (kamma-
nimitta) and 'sign of (the future) 
destiny' (gati-nimitta); these arise as 
mental objects of the last karmic 
consciousness before death (marana^sanna
-kamma; s. karma, III, 3).
Usages (1) and (2) are commentarial (s. 
App.). In sutta usage, the term occurs, 
e.g. as:
3. 'Outward appearance': of one who has 
sense-control it is said- that "he does 
not seize upon the general appearance' 
of an object (na nimittagga^hi^; M. 38, 
D. 2; expl. Vis I, 54f; see si^la).
4. 'Object': the six objects, i.e. 
visual, etc. (rúpa-nimitta; S. XXII, 3).
 Also, when in explanation of animitta-
cetovimutti, signless deliverance of 
mind (s. cetovimutti, vimokkha), it is 
said, 'sabba-nimitta^nam amanasika^ra^',
 it refers to the 6 sense-objects (Com. 
to M. 43), and has therefore to be 
rendered "by paying no attention to any 
object (or object-ideas)." - A pleasant 
<pb n="302"/>
or beautiful object (subha-nimitta, q.v.
) is a condition to the arising of the 
hindrance of sense-desire; a 'repellent 
object' (patigha-nimitta) for the 
hindrance of ill-will; contemplation on 
the impurity of an object (asubha-
nimitta; s. asubha) is an antidote to 
sense-desire.
5. In Pts.M. II, in a repetitive series 
of terms, nimitta appears together with 
uppa^do (origin of existence), pavattam 
(continuity of existence), and may then 
be rendered by 'condition of existence' 
(s. Path, 194f.).

 impermanence, etc., which are also

<xa>niraya</xa>
  lit. 'the downward-path', the nether

Buddhists are well aware that on account
 of the universal sway of impermanence a
 life in hell, just as in heaven, cannot
 last eternally, but will after 
exhaustion of the karma which has caused
 the respective form of rebirth, 
necessarily be followed again by a new 
death and a new rebirth, according to 
the stored-up karma.

<xa>nirodha</xa>
  'extinction'; s. nirodha-sama^patti, 
anupubba-nirodha.

<xa>nirodha^nupassana^</xa>
<pb n="304"/>
  'contemplation of extinction', is one 
of the 18 chief kinds of insight (
vipassana^ q.v.). See a^na^pa^nasati (15
).

<xa>nirodha sama^patti</xa>
 'attainment of extinction' (S. XIV, 11)
, also called san~n~a^-vedayita-nirodha,
 'extinction of feeling and perception',
 is the temporary suspension of all 
consciousness and mental activity, 
following immediately upon the semi-
conscious state called 'sphere of 
neither-perception-nor-non-perception' (
s. jha^na, 8). The absolutely necessary 
pre-conditions to its attainment are 
said to be perfect mastery of all the 8 
absorptions (jha^na), as well as the 
previous attainment of Ana^ga^mi or 
Arahatship (s. ariya-puggala).
According to Vis.M. XXIII, the entering 
into this state takes place in the 
following way: by means of mental 
tranquillity (samatha) and insight (
vipassana^) one has to pass through all 
the 8 absorptions one after the other up
 to the sphere of neither-perception-nor
-non-perception and then one has to 
bring this state to an end. If, namely, 
according to the Vis.M., the disciple (
<pb n="305"/>
Ana^ga^mi or Arahat) passes through the 
absorption merely by means of 
tranquillity, i.e. concentration, he 
will only attain the sphere of neither-
perception-nor-non-perception, and then 
come to a standstill; if, on the other 
hand, he proceeds only with insight, he 
will reach the fruition (phala) of Ana^
ga^mi or Arahatship. He, however, who by
 means of both faculties has risen from 
absorption to absorption and, having 
made the necessary preparations, brings 
the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non
-perception to an end, such a one 
reaches the state of extinction. Whilst 
the disciple is passing through the 8 
absorptions, he each time emerges from 
the absorption attained, and regards 
with his insight all the mental 
phenomena constituting that special 
absorption, as impermanent, miserable 
and impersonal. Then he again enters the
 next higher absorption, and thus, after
 each absorption practising insight, he 
at last reaches the state of neither-
perception-nor-non-perception, and 
thereafter the full extinction. This 
state, according to the Com., may last 
for 7 days or even longer. Immediately 
at the rising from this state, however, 
<pb n="306"/>
there arises in the Ana^ga^mi the 
fruition of Ana^ga^miship (ana^ga^mi-
phala), in the Arahat the fruition of 
Arahatship (arahatta-phala).
With regard to the difference existing 
between the monk abiding in this state 
of extinction on the one hand, and a 
dead person on the other hand, M 43 says
: "In him who is dead, and whose life 
has come to an end, the bodily (in-and-
outbreathing), verbal (thought-
conception and discursive thinking), and
 mental functions (s. sankha^ra, 2) have
 become suspended and come to a 
standstill, life is exhausted, the vital
 heat extinguished, the faculties are 
destroyed. Also in the monk who has 
reached 'extinction of perception and 
feeling' (san~n~a^-vedayita-nirodha), 
the bodily, verbal and mental functions 
have been suspended and come to a 
standstill, but life is not exhausted, 
the vital heat not extinguished, and the
 faculties are not destroyed."

" 'Based on craving' is that kind of 
morality which has come about by the 
desire for a happy existence, e.g.: 'O 
that by this morality I might become a 
godlike or heavenly being!' (A.IX, 172).
 'Based on views' is that morality which
 has been induced by the view that 
through the observation of certain moral
 rules purification may be attained" (

<xa>ni^varana</xa>
  'hindrances', are 5 qualities which 
are obstacles to the mind and blind our 
mental vision. In the presence of them 
we cannot reach neighbourhood-
concentration (upaca^ra-sama^dhi) and 
full concentration (appana^-sama^dhi), 
and are unable to discern clearly the 
truth. They are:
1. sensuous desire (ka^macchanda),
2. ill-will (vya^pa^da),
3. sloth and torpor (thi^na-middha),
4. restlessness and scruples (uddhacca-
kukkucca), and
5. skeptical doubt (vicikiccha^; q.v.).
In the beautiful similes in A. V, 193, 
sensuous desire is compared with water 
mixed with manifold colours, ill-will 
with boiling water, sloth and torpor 
with water covered by moss, restlessness
 and scruples with agitated water 
whipped by the wind, skeptical doubt 
with turbid and muddy water. Just as in 
<pb n="309"/>
such water one cannot perceive one's own
 reflection, so in the presence of these
 5 mental hindrances, one cannot clearly
 discern one's own benefit, nor that of 
others, nor that of both.
Regarding the temporary suspension of 
the 5 hindrances on entering the first 
absorption, the stereotype sutta text (e
 g. A. IX, 40) runs as follows:
"He has cast away sensuous desire; he 
dwells with a heart free from sensuous 
desire; from desire he cleanses his 
heart.
"He has cast away ill-will; he dwells 
with a heart free from ill-will, 
cherishing love and compassion toward 
all living beings, he cleanses his heart
 from ill-will.
"He has cast away sloth and torpor; he 
dwells free from sloth and torpor; 
loving the light, with watchful mind, 
with clear consciousness, he cleanses 
his mind from sloth and torpor.
"He has cast away restlessness and 
scruples; dwelling with mind undisturbed
, with heart full of peace, he cleanses 
his mind from restlessness and scruples.
"He has cast away skeptical doubt; 
dwelling free from doubt, full of 
confidence in the good, he cleanses his 
<pb n="310"/>
heart from doubt.
"He has put aside these 5 hindrances, 
and come to know these paralysing 
defilements of the mind. And far from 
sensual impressions, far from 
unwholesome things, he enters into the 
first absorption, etc."
The overcoming of these 5 hindrances by 
the absorptions is, as already pointed 
out, a merely temporary suspension, 
called 'overcoming through repression' (
vikkhambhana-paha^na). They disappear 
forever on entering the 4 supermundane 
paths (s. ariyapuggala), i.e. skeptical 
doubt on reaching Sota^panship; sensuous
 desire, ill-will and mental worry on 
reaching Ana^ga^miship; sloth, torpor 
and restlessness on reaching Arahatship.
For their origination and their 
overcoming, s. A. I, 2; VI, 21; S. XLVI,
 51.

<xa>paccavekkhana n~a^na</xa>
 'retrospective knowledge', refers to

 any absorption (jha^na q.v.), or any 
supermundane path, or fruition of the 
path, etc. (s. ariya-puggala). As it is 
said: "At the end of fruitional 
consciousness, consciousness sinks into 
the subconscious stream of existence (
bhavanga-sota, q.v.). Then, breaking off
 the stream of existence, mental 
advertence (manodva^ra^vajjana) arises 
at the mind-door, for the purpose of 
retrospecting the (just passed) path-
moment. Now, as soon as this stage has 
passed, 7 moments of impulsive 
consciousness (javana-citta), one after 
the other, flash up while retrospecting 
the path. After they again have sunk 
into the subconscious stream, there 
arise, for the purpose of retrospecting 
the fruition of the path the moments of 
advertence and impulsion, during whose 
arising the monk is retrospecting the 
<pb n="319"/>
path, retrospecting the fruition, 
retrospecting the abandoned defilements,
 retrospecting the still remaining 
defilements, retrospecting Nibba^na as 
object .... 'This blessing have I

<xa>paccaya</xa>
  'condition', is something on which 
something else, the so-called '
conditioned thing', is dependent, and 
without which the latter cannot be. 
Manifold are the ways in which one thing
, or one occurrence, may be the 
condition for some other thing, or 
occurrence. In the Pattha^na, the last 
book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka (
comprising 6 large vols. in the Siamese 
edition), these 24 modes of 
conditionality are enumerated and 
<pb n="320"/>
explained, and then applied to all 
conceivable mental and physical 
phenomena and occurrences, and thus 
their conditioned nature is demonstrated
.
The first two volumes of the Pattha^na 
have been translated into English by the
 Venerable U Na^rada (Múlapattha^na 
Sayadaw) of Burma, under the title 
Conditional Relations (Published by the 
Pa^li Text Society, London 1969, 1981). 
For a synopsis of this work, see Guide 
VII.
The 24 modes of conditionality are:
 
1. Root condition : hetu paccaya
2. Object " : a^rammana "
3. Predominance " : adhipati "
4. Priority " : anantara "

21. Presence " : atthi "
22. Absence " : natthi "
23. Disappearance " : vigata "
24. Non-disappearance " : avigata "
 
(1) Root-condition (hetu-paccaya) is 
that condition that resembles the root 
of a tree. Just as a tree rests on its 
root, and remains alive only as long as 
its root is not destroyed, similarly all
 karmically wholesome and unwholesome 
mental states are entirely dependent on 
the simultaneity and presence of their 
respective roots, i.e, of greed (lobha),
 hate (dosa), delusion (moha), or 
greedlessness (alobha), hatelessness (
adosa), undeludedness (amoha). For the 
definition of these 6 roots, s. múla.
"The roots are a condition by way of 
root for the (mental) phenomena 
associated with a root, and for the 
corporeal phenomena produced thereby (e.
g. for bodily expression)" (Patth).
(2) Object-condition (a^rammana-paccaya)
 is called something which, as object, 
<pb n="322"/>
forms the condition for consciousness 
and mental phenomena. Thus, the physical
 object of sight consisting in colour 
and light ('light-wave'), is the 
necessary condition and the sine qua non
 for the arising of eye-consciousness (
cakkhu-vin~n~a^na), etc.; sound ('sound 
wave') for ear-consciousness (sota^-vin~
n~a^na), etc.; further, any object 
arising in the mind is the condition for
 mind-consciousness (mano-vin~n~a^na). 
The mind-object may be anything whatever
, corporeal or mental, past, present or 
future, real or imaginary.
(3) Predominance-condition (adhipati-
paccaya) is the term for 4 things, on 
the preponderance and predominance of 
which are dependent the mental phenomena
 associated with them, namely: 
concentrated intention (chanda, q.v.), 
energy (viriya, q.v.), consciousness (
citta) and investigation (vi^mamsa^). In
 one and the same state of consciousness
, however, only one of these 4 phenomena
 can be predominant at a time. "Whenever
 such phenomena as consciousness and 
mental concomitants are arising by 
giving preponderance to one of these 4 
things, then this phenomenon is for the 
other phenomena a condition by way of 
<pb n="323"/>
predominance" (Patth.). Cf. iddhi-pa^da.
(4-5) Proximity and contiguity (or 
immediacy)-condition (anantara and 
samanantara-paccaya) - both being 
identical - refer to any state of 
consciousness and mental phenomena 
associated with them, which are the 
conditions for the immediately following
 stage in the process of consciousness. 
For example, in the visual process, eye-
consciousness is for the immediately 
following mindelement - performing the 
function of receiving the visible object
 - a condition by way of contiguity; and
 so is this mind-element for the next 
following mind-consciousness element, 
performing the function of investigating
 the object, etc. Cf. vin~n~a^na-kicca.
(6) Co-nascence condjtion (sahaja^ta-
paccaya), i.e. condition by way of 
simultaneous arising, is a phenomenon 
that for another one forms, a condition 
in such a way that, simultaneously with 
its arising, also the other thing must 
arise. Thus, for instance, in one and 
the same moment each of the 4 mental 
groups (feeling, perception, mental 
formations and consciousness) is for the
 3 other groups a condition by way of co
-nascence or co-arising; or again each 
<pb n="324"/>
of the 4 physical elements (solid, 
liquid, heat, motion) is such a 
condition for the other 3 elements. Only
 at the moment of conception in the 
mother's womb does corporeality (
physical base of mind) serve for the 4 
mental groups as a condition by way of 
conascence.
(7) Condition by way of mutuality (an~n~
a^man~n~a-paccaya). All the just 
mentioned associated and co-nascent 
mental phenomena, as well as the 4 
physical elements, are, of course, at 
the same time also conditioned by way of
 mutuality, "just like three sticks 
propped up one by another." The 4 mental
 groups are one for another a condition 
by way of mutuality. So also are the 4 
elements, and also mentality and 
corporeality at the moment of conception
.
(8) Support-condition (nissaya-paccaya).
 This condition refers either to a pre-
nascent (s. 10) or co-nascent (s. 6) 
phenomenon which is aiding other 
phenomena in the manner of a foundation 
or base, just as the trees have the 
earth as their foundation, or as the oil
-painting rests on the canvas. In this 
way, the 5 sense-organs and the physical
<pb n="325"/>
 base of the mind are for the 
corresponding 6 kinds of consciousness a
 prenascent, i.e. previously arisen, 
condition by way of support. Further all
 co-nascent (s. 6) phenomena are 
mutually (s. 7) conditioned by each 
other by way of support.
(9) Decisive-support (or inducement) 
condition (upanissaya-paccaya) is 
threefold, namely (a) by way of object (
a^rammanúpanissaya-paccaya), (b) by way 
of proximity (anantarúpanissaya), (c) 
natural decisive support (
pakatupanissaya). These conditions act 
as strong inducement or cogent reason.
(a) Anything past, present or future, 
corporeal or mental, real or imaginary, 
may, as object of our thinking, become a
 decisive support, or strong inducement,
 to moral, immoral or karmically neutral
 states of mind. Evil things, by wrong 
thinking about them, become an 
inducement to immoral life; by right 
thinking, an inducement to moral life. 
But good things may be an inducement not
 only to similarly good things, but also
 to bad things, such as self-conceit, 
vanity, envy, etc.
(b;) is identical with proximity 
condition (No. 4).
<pb n="326"/>
(c) Faith, virtue, etc., produced in one
's own mind, or the influence of climate
, food, etc., on one's body and mind, 
may act as natural and decisive support-
conditions. Faith may be a direct and 
natural inducement to charity, virtue to
 mental training, etc.; greed to theft, 
hate to murder; unsuitable food and 
climate to ill-health; friends to 
spiritual progress or deterioration.
(10) Pre-nascence-condition (pureja^ta-
paccaya) refers to something previously 
arisen, which forms a base for something
 arising later on. For example, the 5 
physical sense-organs and the physical 
base of mind, having already arisen at 
the time of birth, form the condition 
for the consciousness arising later, and
 for the mental phenomena associated 
therewith.
(11) Post-nascence-condition (paccha^-ja
^ta-paccaya) refers to consciousness and
 the phenomena therewith associated, 
because they are - just as is the 
feeling of hunger- a necessary condition
 for the preservation of this already 
arisen body.
(12) Repetition-condition (a^sevana-
paccaya) refers to the karmical 
consciousness, in which each time the 
<pb n="327"/>
preceding impulsive moments (javana-
citta, q.v.) are for all the succeeding 
ones a condition by way of repetition 
and frequency, just as in learning by 
heart, through constant repetition, the 
later recitation becomes gradually 
easier and easier.
(13) Karma-condition (kamma-paccaya). 
The pre-natal karma (i.e karma-volitions
, kamma-cetana^, in a previous birth) is
 the generating condition (cause) of the
 5 sense-organs, the fivefold sense-
consciousness, and the other karma-
produced mental and corporeal phenomena 
in a later birth. - Karmical volition is
 also a condition by way of karma for 
the co-nascent mental phenomena 
associated therewith, but these 
phenomena are in no way karma-results.
(14) Karma-result-condition (vipa^ka-
paccaya). The karma-resultant 5 kinds of
 sense-consciousness are a condition by 
way of karma-result for the co-nascent 
mental and corporeal phenomena.
(15) Nutriment-condition (a^ha^ra-
paccaya). For the 4 nutriments, s. a^ha^
ra.
(16) Faculty-condition (indriya-paccaya)
. This condition applies to 20 faculties
 (indriya, q.v.), leaving out No. 7 and 
<pb n="328"/>
8 from the 22 faculties. Of these 20 
faculties, the 5 physical sense-organs (
1 - 5), in their capacity as faculties, 
form a condition only for uncorporeal 
phenomena (eye-consciousness etc.); 
physical vitality (6) and all the 
remaining faculties, for the co-nascent 
mental and corporeal phenomena.
(17) Jha^na-condition (jha^na-paccaya) 
is a name for the 7 so-called jha^na-
factors, as these form a condition to 
the co-nascent mental and corporeal 
phenomena, to wit: (1) thought-
conception (vitakka), (2) discursive 
thinking (vica^ra), (3) interest (pi^ti)
, (4) joy (sukha), (5) sadness (
domanassa), (6) indifference (upekkha^),
 (7) concentration (sama^dhi). (For 
definition s. Pa^li terms. )
1, 2, 3, 4, 7 are found in 4 classes of 
greedy consciousness (s. Tab. I. 22-25);
 1, 2, 5, 7 in hateful consciousness (ib
. 30, 31); 1, 2, 6, 7 in the classes of 
deluded consciousness (ib. 32, 33).
This condition does not only apply to 
jha^na alone, but also to the general 
intensifying ('absorbing') impact of 
these 7 factors.
(18) Path-condition (magga-paccaya) 
refers to the 12 path-factors, as these 
<pb n="329"/>
are for the karmically wholesome and 
unwholesome mental phenomena associated 
with them, a way of escape from this or 
that mental constitution, namely: (1) 
knowledge (pan~n~a^ = samma^ditthi, 
right understanding), (2) (right or 
wrong) thought-conception (vitakka), (3)
 right speech (samma^-va^ca^), (4) right
 bodily action (samma^-kammanta), (5) 
right livelihood (samma^-a^ji^va), (6) (
right or wrong) energy (viriya), (7) (
right or wrong) mindfulness (sati), (8) 
(right or wrong) concentration (sama^dhi
), (9) wrong views (miccha^ditthi), (10)
 wrong speech (miccha^-va^ca^), (11) 
wrong bodily action (miccha^-kammanta), 
(12) wrong livelihood (miccha^-a^ji^va).
 Cf. magga.
(19) Association-condition (sampayutta-
paccaya) refers to the co-nascent (s. 6)
 and mutually (s. 7) conditioned 4 
mental groups (khandha), "as they aid 
each other by their being associated, by
 having a common physical base, a common
 object, and by their arising and 
disappearing simultaneously" (Patth. Com
.).
(20) Dissociation-condition (vippayutta-
paccaya) refers to such phenomena as aid
 other phenomena by not baving the same 
<pb n="330"/>
physical base (eye, etc.) and objects. 
Thus corporeal phenomena are for mental 
phenomena, and conversely, a condition 
by way of dissociation, whether co-
nascent or not.
(2l) Presence-condition (atthi-paccaya) 
refers to a phenomenon - being pre-
nascent or co-nascent - which through 
its presence is a condition for other 
phenomena. This condition applies to the
 conditions Nos. 6, 7, 8, 10, 11.
(22) Absence-condition (natthi-paccaya) 
refers to consciousness, etc., which has
 just passed, and which thus forms the 
necessary condition for the immediately 
following stage of consciousness by 
giving it an opportunity to arise. Cf. 
No. 4.
(23) Disappearance-condition (vigata-
paccaya) is identical with No. 22.
(24) Non-disappearance-condition (
avigata-paccaya) is identical with No. 
21.
These 24 conditions should be known 
thoroughly for a detailed understanding 
of that famous formula of the dependent 
origination (paticcasamuppa^da, q.v.).

<xa>pacceka buddha</xa>
 an 'Independently Enlightened One'; or

Enlightened One (renderings by 'Silent' 
or 'Private Buddha' are not very apt). 
This is a term for an Arahat (s. ariya-
puggala) who has realized Nibba^na 
without having heard the Buddha's 
doctrine from others. He comprehends the
 4 Noble Truths individually (pacceka), 
independent of any teacher, by his own 
effort. He has, however, not the 
capacity to proclaim the Teaching 
effectively to others, and therefore 
does not become a 'Teacher of Gods and 
Men', a Perfect or Universal Buddha (
samma^-sambuddha). - Paccekabuddhas are 
described as frugal of speech, 
cherishing solitude. According to 
tradition, they do not arise while the 
Teaching of a Perfect Buddha is known; 
<pb n="332"/>
but for achieving their rank after many 
aeons of effort, they have to utter an 
aspiration before a Perfect Buddha.
Canonical references are few; Pug. 29 (

many Paccekabuddhas are given; in D. 16 
they are said to be worthy of a thúpa (
dagoba); the Treasure-Store Sutta (
Nidhikhandha Sutta, Khp.) mentions 
pacceka-bodhi; the C. Nidd. ascribes to 
individual Paccekabuddhas the verses of 
the Rhinoceros Sutta (Khaggavisa^na 
Sutta, Sn.) - See bodhi.

<xa>pa^daka jjha^na</xa>

<xa>pada parama</xa>
 'one for whom the words are the utmost 
attainment'. "Whoever, though having 
learned much, speaking much, knowing 
many things by heart, and discoursing 
much, has not penetrated the truth, such
 a man is called by that name" (Pug. 163
).

<xa>padha^na</xa>
  'effort.' The 4 right efforts (samma-
padha^na), forming the 6th stage of the 
8-fold Path (i.e. samma^-va^ya^ma, s. 
magga) are: (1) the effort to avoid (
samvara-padha^na), (2) to overcome (paha
^na-padha^na), (3) to develop (bha^vana^
-padha^na), (4) to maintain (anurakkhana
-padha^na), i.e. (1) the effort to avoid
 unwholesome (akusala) states, such as 
evil thoughts, etc. (2) to overcome 
unwholesome states, (3) to develop 
wholesome (kusala) states, such as the 7
 elements of enlightenment (bojjhanga, q
.v.), (4) to maintain the wholesome 
states.
"The monk rouses his will to avoid the 
arising of evil, unwholesome things not 
yet arisen ... to overcome them ... to 
<pb n="334"/>
develop wholesome things not yet arisen 
... to maintain them, and not to let 
them disappear, but to bring them to 
growth, to maturity and to the full 
perfection of development. And he makes 
effort, stirs up his energy, exerts his 
mind and strives" (A. IV, 13).
(1) "What now, o monks, is the effort to
 avoid? Perceiving a form, or a sound, 
or an odour, or a taste, or a bodily or 
mental impression, the monk neither 
adheres to the whole nor to its parts. 
And he strives to ward off that through 
which evil and unwholesome things might 
arise, such as greed and sorrow, if he 
remained with unguarded senses; and he 
watches over his senses, restrains his 
senses. This is called the effort to 
avoid.
(2) "What now is the effort to overcome?
 The monk does not retain any thought of
 sensual lust, or any other evil, 
unwholesome states that may have arisen;
 he abandons them, dispels them, 
destroys them, causes them to disappear.
 This is called the effort to overcome.
(3) "What now is the effort to develop? 
The monk develops the factors of 
enlightenment, bent on solitude, on 
detachment, on extinction, and ending in
<pb n="335"/>
 deliverance, namely: mindfulness (sati)
, investigation of the law (dhamma-
vicaya), energy (viriya), rapture (pi^ti
), tranquillity (passaddhi), 
concentraton (sama^dhi), equanimity (
upekkha^). This is called the effort to 
develop.
(4) "What now is the effort to maintain?
 The monk keeps firmly in his mind a 
favourable object of concentration, such
 as the mental image of a skeleton, a 
corpse infested by worms, a corpse 
blueblack in colour, a festering corpse,
 a corpse riddled with holes, a corpse 
swollen up. This is called the effort to
 maintain" (A. IV, 14).

<xa>padha^niyanga</xa>
  'elements of effort', are the 
following 5 qualities: faith, health, 
sincerity, energy, and wisdom (M. 85, 90

<xa>pa^gun~n~ata^</xa>

kinds of overcoming: (1) overcoming by 
repression (vikkhambhana-paha^na), i.e. 
the temporary suspension of the 5 
hindrances (ni^varana, q.v.) during the 
absorptions, (2) overcoming by the 
opposite (tadanga-paha^na), (3) 
overcoming by destruction (samuccheda-
paha^na), (4) overcoming by 
tranquillization (patipassaddhi-paha^na)
, (5) overcoming by escape (nissarana-
paha^na).
(1) "Among these, 'overcoming by 
repression' is the pushing back of 
adverse things, such as the 5 mental 
hindrances (ni^varana q.v), etc., 
through this or that mental 
concentration (sama^dhi, q.v.), just as 
a pot thrown into moss-clad water pushes
 the moss aside....
(2) " 'Overcoming by the opposite' is 
the overcoming by opposing this or that 
thing that is to be overcome, by this or
 that factor of knowledge belonging to 
insight (vipassana^ q.v.), just as a 
lighted lamp dispels the darkness of the
 night. In this way, the personality-
<pb n="337"/>
belief (sakka^yaditthi, s. ditthi) is 
overcome by determining the mental and 
corporeal phenomena ... the view of 
uncausedness of existence by 
investigation into the conditions... the
 idea of eternity by contemplation of 
impermanency ... the idea of happiness 
by contemplation of misery....
(3) "If through the knowledge of the 
noble path (s. ariyapuggala) the fetters
 and other evil things cannot continue 
any longer, just like a tree destroyed 
by lightning, then such an overcoming is
 called 'overcoming by destruction' " (
Vis.M. XXII, 110f.).
(4) When, after the disappearing of the 
fetters at the entrance into the paths, 
the fetters, from the moment of fruition
 (phala) onwards, are forever extinct 
and stilled, such overcoming is called 
the 'overcoming by tranquillization'.
(5) "The 'overcoming by escape' is 
identical with the extinction and Nibba^
na" (Pts.M. I. 27). (App.).

 'five-group existence', is a name for 
existence in the sensuous sphere (ka^ma^
vacara), or in the fine-material sphere 
(rúpa^vacara, s. avacara), since all the
 5 groups of existence (khandha, q.v.) 
are found there. In the immaterial 
sphere (arúpa^vacara, s. avacara), 
however, only the 4 mental groups are 
found, and in the world of unconscious 
beings (asan~n~a^-satta, q.v.) only the 
one corporeality group. Cf eka-voka^ra-
bhava and catu-pan~ca-voka^ra-bhava; 
further s. avacara. - (App.: voka^ra).

<xa>pan~ha^ bya^karana</xa>
 'answering questions'. "There are, o 
<pb n="340"/>
monks, 4 ways of answering questions: 
there are questions requiring a direct 
answer; questions requiring an 
explanation; questions to be answered by
 counter-questions; questions to be 
rejected (as wrongly put)." See D. 33; A
. III, 68; A. IV, 42.

<xa>pan~n~a^</xa>
  'understanding, knowledge, wisdom, 
insight', comprises a very wide field. 
The specific Buddhist knowledge or 
wisdom, however, as part of the Noble 
Eightfold Path (magga, q.v.) to 
deliverance, is insight (vipassana^, q.v
.), i.e. that intuitive knowledge which 
brings about the 4 stages of holiness 
and the realization of Nibba^na (s. 
ariyapuggala), and which consists in the
 penetration of the impermanency (anicca
, q.v.), misery (dukkha, s. sacca) and 
impersonality (anatta^) of all forms of 
existence. Further details, s. under 
tilakkhana.
With regard to the condition of its 
arising one distinguishes 3 kinds of 
knowledge knowledge based on thinking (
cinta^-maya^-pan~n~a^), knowledge based 
on learning (suta-maya^-pan~n~a^), 
knowledge based on mental development (
<pb n="341"/>
bha^vana^-maya^-pan~n~a^) (D. 33).
" 'Based on thinking' is that knowledge 
which one has accquired through one's 
own thinking, without having learnt it 
from others. 'Based on learning' is that
 knowledge which one has heard from 
others and thus acquired through 
learning. 'Based on mental development' 
is that knowledge which one has acquired
 through mental development in this or 
that way, and which has reached the 
stage of full concentration" (appana^, q
.v.) (Vis.M. XIV).
Wisdom is one of the 5 mental faculties 
(s. bala), one of the 3 kinds of 
training (sikkha^, q.v.), and one of the
 perfections (s. pa^rami^) For further 
details, s. vipassana^, and the detailed
 exposition in Vis.M. XIV, 1-32.

<xa>pan~n~atti  si^la</xa>
 'prescribed morality', is a name for 
the disciplinary rules of the monk or 
layman prescribed by the Buddha, as 
distinguished from natural or genuine 
morality (pakati-si^la; s. si^la).

<xa>pan~n~a^ vimutti</xa>
 'deliverance through wisdom' (or 
understanding'), signifies, according to
<pb n="342"/>
 Com. to A.V, 142, the wisdom associated
 with the fruition of holiness (arahatta
-phala). In Pug. 31 and similarly in M. 
70, it is said: "A monk may not have 
reached in his own person the 8 
liberations (=jha^na, q.v.), but through
 his wisdom the cankers have come to 
extinction in him. Such a person is 
called wisdom-liberated" (pan~n~a^-
vimutta). - Com. to Pug.: "He may be one
 of five persons: either a practiser of 
bare insight (sukkha-vipassako, q.v.), 
or one who has attained to Holiness 
after rising from one of the absorptions
." See S. XII, 7().
The term is often linked with ceto-
vimutti (q.v.), 'deliverance of mind'.

<xa>papan~ca</xa>
  (Sanskrit prapan~ca): In doctrinal 
usage, it signifies the expansion, 
differentiation, 'diffuseness' or '
manifoldness' of the world; and it may 
also refer to the 'phenomenal world' in 
general, and to the mental attitude of '
worldliness'. In A. IV, 173, it is said:
 "As far as the field of sixfold sense-
impression extends, so far reaches the 
world of diffuseness (or the phenomenal 
world; papan~cassa gati); as far as the 
<pb n="343"/>
world of diffuseness extends, so far 
extends the field of sixfold sense-
impression. Through the complete fading 
away and cessation of the field of 
sixfold sense-impression, there comes 
about the cessation and the coming-to-
rest of the world of diffuseness (papan~
ca-nirodho papan~ca-vupasamo)." The 
opposite term nippapan~ca is a name for 
Nibba^na (S. LIII), in the sense of '
freedom from samsaric diffuseness'. - 
Dhp. 254: "Mankind delights in the 
diffuseness of the world, the Perfect 
Ones are free from such diffuseness" (
papan~ca^bhirata^ paja^, nippapan~ca 
tatha^gata^). - The 8th of the 'thoughts
 of a great man' (maha^-purisa-vitakka; 
A. VIII, 30) has: "This Dhamma is for 
one who delights in non-diffuseness (the
 unworldly, Nibba^na); it is not for him
 who delights in worldliness (papan~ca).
" - For the psychological sense of '
differentiation', see M. 18 (
Madhupindika Sutta): "Whatever man 
conceives (vitakketi) that he 
differentiates (papan~ceti); and what he
 differentiates, by reason thereof ideas
 and considerations of differentiation (
papan~ca-san~n~a^-sankha^) arise in him.
" On this text and the term papan~ca, 
<pb n="344"/>
see Dr. Kurt Schmidt in German Buddhist 
Writers (WHEEL 74/75) p. 61ff. - See D. 
21 (Sakka's Quest; WHEEL 10, p.
In the commentaries, we often find a 
threefold classification tanha^-, ditthi
-, ma^na-papan~ca, which probably means 
the world's diffuseness created hy 
craving, false views and conceit. - See 
M. 123; A. IV, 173; A. VI, 14, Sn. 530, 
874, 916.
n~a^nananda Bhikkhu, in Concept and 
Reality: An Essay on Papan~ca and Papan~
ca-san~n~a^-sankha^ (Kandy 1971, 
Buddhist Publication Society), suggests 
that the term refers to man's "tendency 
towards proliferation in the realm of 
concepts" and proposes a rendering by "
conceptual proliferation," which appears
 convincing in psychological context, e.
g. in two of the texts quoted above, A. 
IV, 173 and M. 18. - The threefold 
classification of papan~ca, by way of 
craving, false views and conceit, is 
explained by the author as three aspects
, or instances, of the foremost of 
delusive conceptualisations, the ego-
concept.

<xa>para^ma^sa</xa>
  'adherence', attachment, '
<pb n="345"/>
misapprehension', is according to Vis.M.
 XXII a name for wrong views; in that 
sense it occurs in Dhs. 1174 ff. - See 
si^labbata-para^ma^sa.

<xa>paramattha</xa>
 (-sacca, -vacana, -desana^): 'truth (or
 term, exposition) that is true in the 
highest (or ultimate) sense', as 
contrasted with the 'conventional truth'
 (voha^ra-sacca), which is also called '
commonly accepted truth' (sammuti-sacca;
 in Skr: samvrti-satya). The Buddha, in 
explaining his doctrine, sometimes used 
conventional language and sometimes the 
philosophical mode of expression which 
is in accordance whith undeluded insight
 into reality. In that ultimate sense, 
existence is a mere process of physical 
and mental phenomena within which, or 
beyond which, no real ego-entity nor any
 abiding substance can ever be found. 
Thus, whenever the suttas speak of man, 
woman or person, or of the rebirth of a 
being, this must not be taken as being 
valid in the ultimate sense, but as a 
mere conventional mode of speech (voha^
ra-vacana).
It is one of the main characteristics of
 the Abhidhamma Pitaka, in distinction 
<pb n="346"/>
from most of the Sutta Pitaka, that it 
does not employ conventional language, 
but deals only with ultimates, or 
realities in the highest sense (
paramattha-dhamma^). But also in the 
Sutta Pitaka there are many expositions 
in terms of ultimate language (
paramattha-desana^), namely, wherever 
these texts deal with the groups (
khandha), elements (dha^tu) or sense-
bases (a^yatana), and their components; 
and wherever the 3 characteristics (ti-
lakkhana, q.v.) are applied. The 
majority of Sutta texts, however, use 
the conventional language, as 
appropriate in a practical or ethical 
context, because it "would not be right 
to say that 'the groups' (khandha) feel 
shame, etc."
It should be noted, however, that also 
statements of the Buddha couched in 
conventional language, are called 'truth
' (voha^ra-sacca), being correct on 
their own level, which does not 
contradict the fact that such statements
 ultimately refer to impermanent and 
impersonal processes.
The two truths - ultimate and 
conventional - appear in that form only 
in the commentaries, but are implied in 
<pb n="347"/>
a sutta-distinction of 'explicit (or 
direct) meaning' (ni^tattha, q.v.) and '
implicit meaning (to be inferred)' (
neyyattha). Further, the Buddha 
repeatedly mentioned his reservations 
when using conventional speech, e.g. in 
D. 9: "These are merely names, 
expressions, turns of speech, 
designations in common use in the world,
 which the Perfect Qne (Tatha^gata) uses
 without misapprehending them." See also
 S. I. 25.
The term paramattha, in the sense here 
used, occurs in the first para. of the 
Katha^vatthu, a work of the Abhidhamma 
Pitaka (s. Guide, p. 62). (App: voha^ra)
.
The commentarial discussions on these 
truths (Com. to D. 9 and M. 5) have not 
yet been translated in full. On these 
see K N. Jayatilleke, Early Buddhist 
Theory of Knowledge (London, 1963), pp. 
361ff.
In Maha^yana, the Ma^dhyamika school has
 given a prominent place to the teaching
 of the two truths.

<xa>parami^ = pa^ramita^</xa>
 'perfection'. Ten qualities leading to 
Buddhahood: (1) perfection in giving (or
<pb n="348"/>
 liberality; da^na-pa^rami^), (2) 
morality (si^la-p.), (3) renunciation (
nekkhamma-p.), (4) wisdom (pan~n~a^-p.),
 (5) energy (viriya-p.), (6) patience (
or forbearance; khanti p.), (7) 
truthfulness (sacca-p.), (8) resolution 
(adhittha^na-p.), (9) loving-kindness (
metta^-p.) (10) equanimity (upekkha^-p.)
.
These qualities were developed and 
brought to maturity by the Bodhisatta in
 his past existences, and his way of 
practising them is illustrated in many 
of the Birth Stories (Ja^taka), of which
, however, only the verses are regarded 
as canonical. Apart from the latter, the
 10 pa^rami^ are mentioned in only two 
other canonical works which are probably
 apocryphal, the Buddhavamsa (in the 
Story of Sumedha) and the Cariyapitaka. 
A long and methodical exposition of the 
pa^rami^ is given in the concluding 
Miscellaneous Section (pakinnakakatha^) 
of the Com. to Cariyapitaka
In Vis.M. IX it is said that through 
developing the 4 sublime states (loving-
kindness, compassion, altruistic joy, 
equanimity; s. brahma-viha^ra), one may 
reach these 10 perfections, namely:
"As the Great Beings (maha^-satta; a 
<pb n="349"/>
synonym often found in the Maha^yana 
scriptures for Bodhisatta (q.v.), i.e. '
Enlightenment Being or Being destined 
for Buddhahood) are concerned about the 
welfare of living beings, not tolerating
 the suffering of beings, wishing long 
duration to the higher states of 
happiness of beings, and being impartial
 and just to all beings, therefore (1) 
they give alms (da^na, q.v.) to all 
beings so that they may be happy, 
without Investigating whether they are 
worthy or not. (2) By avoiding to do 
them any harm, they observe morality (si
^la q.v.). (3) In order to bring 
morality to perfection, they train 
themselves in renunciation (nekkhamma). 
(4) In order to understand clearly what 
is beneficial and injurious to beings, 
they purify their wisdom (pan~n~a^). (5)
 For the sake of the welfare and 
happiness of others they constantly 
exert their energy (viriya). (6) Though 
having become heroes through utmost 
energy, they are nevertheless full of 
forbearance (khanti) toward s the 
manifold failings of beings . (7) Once 
they have promised to give or do 
something, they do not break their 
promise ('truthfulness'; sacca). (8) 
<pb n="350"/>
With unshakable resolution (adhittha^na)
 they work for the weal and welfare of 
beings. (9) With unshakable kindness (
metta^) they are helpful to all. (10) By
 reason of their equanimity (upekkha^) 
they do not expect anything in return" (
Vis.M. IX. 24).
In the Maha^yana scriptures, where the 
pa^rami^ occupy a much more prominent 
place, a partly differing list of six is
 given: liberality, morality, patience, 
energy, meditation. and wisdom.

does not reach them according to his 
wish, and not without trouble and 
exertion; and not according to his wish 
with regard to place, object and 
duration, does he enter them, or rise 
therefrom. Therefore it is well possible
 that such a monk, through negligence,

<xa>parinibba^na</xa>
  'full Nibba^na', is a synonym for

 it. Cf. nibba^na.

<xa>parin~n~a^</xa>
  'full understanding', full 
comprehension. There are 3 kinds of 
mundane f.u. (lokiya-p.), namely: full 
understanding of the known (n~a^ta-p.), 
f.u. as investigating (ti^rana-p.), and 
f.u. as overcoming (paha^na-p.) In Vis.M
. XX, 3 it is said:
"Full understanding of the known is the 
knowledge consisting in the discernment 
of the specific characteristics of such 
<pb n="353"/>
and such phenomena, as: 'Corporeality 
has the characteristic of being 
oppressed; feeling has the 
characteristic of being felt, etc.'
"Full understanding by investigating is 
that insight-wisdom (vipassana^-pan~n~a^
; s. vipassana^), which has the 3 
general characteristics (impermanence, 
suffering, not-self) as its objects, and
 which arises when attributing a general
 characteristic to (physical and mental)
 phenomena, as for instance: '
Corporeality is impermanent, feeling is 
impermanent, etc.'
"Full understanding by overcorning is 
that insight-wisdom which has the above 
mentioned general characteristics as its
 objects, and arises after overcoming 
the idea of permanence, etc." - (App.).

<xa>pa^risuddhi padha^niyanga</xa>
 the 4 'elements of the effort for 
purity', are: effort for purity of 
morality (si^la-parisuddhi-padha^niyanga
), for purity of mind (citta), of view (
ditthi), of deliverance (vimutti). Cf. A
. IV, 194. - Another 9 factors are

knowledge (vijja^-p.-p.) and of 
deliverance (vimutti-p.-p.).

<xa>pa^risuddhi si^la</xa>

  'learning the doctrine', the 'wording 
of the doctrine'. In the 'progress of 
the disciple' (q.v.), 3 stages may be 
distinguished: theory, practice,

wording of the doctrine (pariyatti), (2)
 practising it (patipatti), (3)

 the 'analytical knowledge of ready wit'

<xa>paticcasamuppa^da</xa>
  'dependent origination', is the 
doctrine of the conditionality of all 
physical and psychical phenomena, a 
doctrine which, together with that of 
impersonality (anatta^ q.v.), forms the 
indispensable condition for the real 
understanding and realization of the 
teaching of the Buddha. It shows the 
conditionality and dependent nature of 
that uninterrupted flux of manifold 
physical and psychical phenomena of 
existence conventionally called the ego,
<pb n="357"/>
 or man, or animal, etc.
Whereas the doctrine of impersonality, 
or anatta^, proceeds analytically, by 
splitting existence up into the ultimate
 constituent parts, into mere empty, 
unsubstantial phenomena or elements, the
 doctrine of dependent origination, on 
the other hand, proceeds synthetically, 
by showing that all these phenomena are,
 in some way or other, conditionally 
related with each other. In fact, the 
entire Abhidhamma Pitaka, as a whole, 
treats really of nothing but just these 
two doctrines: phenomenality - implying 
impersonality and conditionality of all 
existence. The former or analytical 
method is applied in Dhammasangani, the 
first book of the Abhidhamma Pitaka; the
 latter or synthetical method, in Pattha
^na, the last book of the Abhidhamma 
Pitaka. For a synopsis of these two 
works, s. Guide I and VII.
Though this subject has been very 
frequently treated by Western authors, 
by far most of them have completely 
misunderstood the true meaning and 
purpose of the doctrine of dependent 
origination, and even the 12 terms 
themselves have often been rendered 
wrongly.
<pb n="358"/>
The formula of dependent origination 
runs as follows:
1. Avijia^-paccaya^ sankha^ra^: "Through
 ignorance are conditioned the sankha^
ras," i.e. the rebirth-producing 
volitions (cetana^), or 'karma-
formations' .
2. Sankha^ra-paccaya^ vin~n~a^nam: "
Through the karma-formations (in the 
past life) is conditioned consciousness 
(in the present life)."
3. Vin~n~a^na-paccaya^ na^ma-rúpam: "
Through consciousness are conditioned 
the mental and physical phenomena (na^ma

-called individual existence.
4. Na^ma-rúpa-paccaya^ sala^yatanam: "
Through the mental and physical

Before taking up the study of the 
following exposition, it is suggested 
that the reader first goes thoroughly 
through the article on the 24 conditions
 (s. paccaya). For a thorough 
understanding of the paticcasamuppa^da 
he should know the main modes of 
conditioning, as decisive support, co-
nascence, pre-nascence, etc.
For a closer study of the subject should
 be consulted: Vis.M. XVII; Fund. III; 
Guide (Ch. VII and Appendix); Dependent 
Origination, by Piyadassi Thera (WHEEL 
15); The Significance of Dependent 
Origination (WHEEL 140).
 
(1.) "Through ignorance are conditioned 
the karma-formations" (avijja^-paccaya^ 
sankha^ra^), i.e. all wholesome and 
unwholesome actions (karma, q.v.) of 
body, speech and mind, are conditioned 
through ignorance. By 'karma-formations'
 are meant karmically wholesome and 
unwholesome volitions (cetana^), or 
<pb n="361"/>
volitional activities, in short karma (q
.v., and Fund. II).
In view of the many misconceptions 
current in the West, it is necessary to 
repeat here that karma (q.v.), as a 
technical term, never signifies anything
 but moral or immoral action, i.e. the 
above mentioned volitional activities, 
or karma-formations, as either causing 
results in the present life or being the
 causes of future destiny and rebirth. 
Thus karma, as a philosophical term, 
never means the result of action, as 
often wrongly conceived by Western 
authors.
Now, in what way are the karma-
formations conditioned through ignorance
? As concerns the unwholesome 
karmaformations associated with greed, 
hate or delusion (lobha, dosa, moha), 
these are always and in all 
circumstances, conditioned through the 
simultaneous ignorance inseparably 
associated therewith. Thus, ignorance is
 for the unwholesome karma-formations a 
condition by way of conascence (sahaja^
ta-paccaya), association (sampayutta-
paccaya), presence (atthi-paccaya), etc.
 Ignorance further may be for them a 
condition by way of decisive support or 
<pb n="362"/>
inducement (upanissaya-paccaya), if, for
 instance, ignorance coupled with greed 
induces a man to commit evil deeds, such
 as killing, stealing, unlawful sexual 
intercourse, etc. In these cases, 
therefore, ignorance is a 'natural 
decisive suppport' or 'direct inducement
' (pakati-upanissaya-paccaya). It also 
may become an indirect inducement, by 
way of object (a^rammanúpanissaya-
paccaya) of our thinking. This takes 
place, if, for example, someone 
remembers a former state of ignorance 
combined with sensual enjoyment, and in 
doing so karmically unwholesome states 
spring up, such as sensual desire, grief
, etc.
For the wholesome (kusala) karma-
formations, ignorance can only be a 
condition by way of decisive support (
upanissaya), never by way of co-nascence
 (sahaja^ta), etc., since wholesome 
consciousness at that very moment, of 
course, cannot be associated with any 
unwholesome phenomenon, such as 
ignorance. Ignorance is a 'natural 
decisive support' or 'direct inducement'
 (pakatupanissaya), for example, if, 
induced by ignorance and vanity, one 
exerts oneself to attain the absorptions
<pb n="363"/>
, and thus finally, through perseverance
, reaches these wholesome states of mind
. Ignorance may also be for wholesome 
karma-formations a 'decisive support' or
 'inducement by way of object' (a^ramman
úpanissaya), if, for example, one 
refleets on ignorance as the root of all
 misery in the world, and thus finally 
attains insight and entrance into one of
 the 4 supermundane paths of holiness.
For ignorance, s. avijja^; for karma-
formations, s. sankha^ra.
 
(2.) "Through the karma-formations is 
conditioned consciousness" (sankha^ra-
paccaya^ vin~n~a^nam). This proposition 
teaches that the wholesome and 
unwholesome karma-formations are the 
causes of future rebirth in an 
appropriate sphere (gati). The karma-
formations of the previous life 
condition the budding in a new mother's 
womb of a fresh psycho-physical 
aggregation of the 5 groups of existence
 (s. khandha), which here are 
represented by consciousness (vin~n~a^na
). All such karma-resultant (vipa^ka) 
consciousness, however, such as eye-
consciousness (seeing), etc., as well as
 all the mental phenomena associated 
<pb n="364"/>
therewith (feeling, etc.), are 
karmically neutral. It should be 
understood that already from the very 
first moment of conception in the mother
's womb, this karma resultant 
eonsciousness of the embryonic being is 
functioning.
Against Dr. Paul Dahlke's misconception 
of the paticcasamuppa^da as "one single 
karmical moment of personal experience,"
 and of the 'simultaneity' of all the 12
 links of this formula, I should like to
 state here distinctly that the 
interpretation of the p. given here as 
comprising 3 successive lives not only 
agrees with all the different schools of
 Buddhism and all the ancient 
commentaries, but also is fully 
identical with the explanations given 
already in the canonical suttas. Thus, 
for example, it is said verbatim in Nida
^na-Samyutta (S. XII, 51): "Once 
ignorance (1) and clinging (9) are 
extinguished, neither karmically 
meritorious, nor demeritorious, nor 
imperturbable karma-formations (2=10) 
are produced, and thus no consciousness 
(3=11) will spring up again in a new 
mother's womb." And further: "For, if 
consciousness were not to appear in the 
<pb n="365"/>
mother's womb, would in that case 
mentality and corporeality (4) arise?" 
Cf. above diagram.
The purpose of the Buddha in teaching 
the p. was to show to suffering mankind 
how, depending on ignorance and delusion
, this present existence and suffering 
has come about, and how through 
extinction of ignorance, and of the 
craving and clinging conditioned thereby
, no more rebirth will follow, and thus 
the standstill of the process of 
existence will have been realized and 
therewith the extinction of all 
suffering.
 
(3.) "Through consciousness are 
conditioned corporeality and mentality" 
(vin~n~a^na-paccaya^ na^ma-rúpani). This
 proposition implies that without 
consciousness there ean be no mental and
 physical process of existence. By 
mentality (na^ma) is here to be 
understood the karma-resultant (vipa^ka)
 mental phenomena, such as feeling (
vedana^), perception (san~n~a^), 
volition (cetana^: non-karmical volition
 is here meant), consciousness-
impression (phassa), advertence (
manasika^ra) (M. 9; S. XII, 2). For the 
<pb n="366"/>
basic 7 mental phenomena inseparably 
associated with every state of 
consciousness, s. na^ma. By corporeality
 (rúpa) is meant the 4 physical elements
 (s. dha^tu) and the corporeality 
dependent thereon (s. khandha, I).
Mentality is always conditioned through 
consciousness; i.e. consciousness (vin~n
~a^na) is for mentality (na^ma) a 
condition by way of conascence (sahaja^
ta), mutuality (an~n~aman~n~a), 
association (sampayutta), etc., since 
the 4 mental groups at all times form an
 inseparable unit.
Consciousness (vin~n~a^na) is for 
corporeality (rúpa) a condition by way 
of co-nascence only at the moment of 
conception, thereafter a condition by 
way of post-nascence (paccha^ja^ta-
paccaya; paccaya 11) and nutriment (a^ha
^ra), i.e. as a support. Just as the 
repeatedly arising hunger is a condition
 and support for the pre-arisen body, so
 is the conseiousness arising afterwards
 a condition and support for the 
maintenance of this pre-arisen body.
 
(4.) "Through mentality and corporeality
 are conditioned the 6 bases (na^ma-rúpa
 paccaya^ sala^yatanam). The 6 bases are
<pb n="367"/>
 a name for the 5 physical sense-organs 
and, as 6th, the mind-base (mana^yatana)
, i.e. consciousness.
Mentality (na^ma; s. 3) is for the 5 
physical bases (a^yatana), or sense-
organs, a condition by way of post-
nascence. Cf. end of 3.
Mentality (na^ma), i.e. feeling. etc., 
is for the 6th base, or consciousness - 
as being always inseparably associated 
therewith a condition by way of co-
nascencc. etc.
Corporeality (rúpa), here the 4 elements
, are for the 5 physical bases (a^yatana
), or sense-organs, a condition by way 
of support (nissaya).
Corporeality (rúpa), here the 5 physical
 sense-organs, are for the 6th base (a^
yatana), i.e. consciousness, a condition
 by way of support and pre-nascence (
pureja^ta-paccaya).
 
(5.) "Through the 6 bases is conditioned
 the (sensorial and mental) impression" 
(sala^yatana-paccaya^ phasso), for 
without the 5 physical bases, or sense-
organs, there can be no sense-
impressions; and without the 6th base, 
or consciousness, there can be no mental
 impression.
<pb n="368"/>
Thus, the 5 physical bases, eye, etc., 
are for the corresponding 5 sense-
impressions (visual impression, etc.) a 
condition by way of support (nissaya) 
and pre-nascence (pureja^ta), whereas 
the 6th, the mind-base (consciousness), 
is for the mental impression a condition
 by way of co-nascence, association, 
mutuality, etc.
 
(6.) "Through impression is conditioned 
feeling" (phassa-paccaya^ vedana^), i.e.
 the sensorial and the mental 
impressions are for the feeling 
associated therewith a condition by way 
of co-nascence, association, mutuality, 
etc.
 
(7.) "Through feeling is conditioned 
craving" (vedana^-paccaya^ tanha^). Any 
(karma-resultant) feeling, whether 
agreeable, disagreeable or neutral, 
bodily or mental, past or expected, may 
become for craving a condition of 
decisive support by way of object (a^
rammanúpanissaya). Even physically and 
mentally painful feeling may, through 
the desire to be released therefrom, 
become for craving a condition of 
decisive support by way of object (a^
<pb n="369"/>
rammanupanissaya).
 
(8.) "Through craving is conditioned 
clinging" (tanha^-paccaya^ upa^da^nam). 
'Clinging' is explained as an 
intensified form of craving. It is of 4 
kinds: (1) clinging to sensuality, (2) 
to erroneous views, (3) to rules and 
ritual, (4) to personality-belief. 
Sensuous craving is to (1) a condition 
of natural decisive support (
pakatupanissaya). For (2-4), craving is 
a condition by way of co-nascence, 
mutuality, root (hetu), etc. It also may
 be a condition of natural decisive 
support. For example, through craving 
for heavenly rebirth, etc. people often 
may be induced to cling to certain rules
 and rituals, with the hope of reaching 
thereby the object of their desires.
 
(9.) "Through clinging is conditioned 
the process of becoming" (upa^da^na-
paccaya^ bhavo), i.e. the wholesome and 
unwholesome active karma-process of 
becoming (kamma-bhava), as well as the 
karma-resultant (vipa^ka) passive 
process, the so-called 'rebirth-process'
 (upapatti-bhava). The karma-process (
kammabhava) comprises the 5 karmical 
<pb n="370"/>
causes: ignorance, karma-formations, 
craving, clinging, karma-process (s. 1, 
2, 8, 9, 10, of the diagram); the 
rebirth-process (upapatti-bhava) 
comprises the 5 karma-results (s. 3-7 of
 the diagram).
The karma-process is here, correctly 
speaking, a collective name for 
generative karmic volition (kamma-cetana
^) and all the mental phenomena 
associated therewith, whilst the 2nd 
link (karma-formations) designates only 
karmic volition (s. a^yúhana). Both, 
however, i.e. the 2nd and 10th 
proposition, practically state one and 
the same thing, namely, that karma is 
the cause of rebirth, as we shall see 
under 10.
Clinging (upa^da^na) may be an 
inducement of decisive support (
upanissaya) to many kinds of wholesome 
and unwholesome karma. Sensuous clinging
 (ka^múpa^da^na), i.e. clinging to 
sensuous objects, for example, may be a 
direct inducement to murder, theft, 
unlawful intercourse with the other sex,
 evil words and thoughts, etc. Clinging 
to rules and ritual (si^labbatúpa^da^na)
 may lead to self-complacency, 
fanaticism, cruelty, etc. Clinging is 
<pb n="371"/>
also for the evil karma associated 
therewith, a condition by way of co-
nascence, association, etc.
 
(10.) "Through the process of becoming 
is conditioned rebirth" (bhava-paccaya^ 
ja^ti), i.e. through the wholesome and 
unwholesome karma-process (kamma-bhava) 
is conditioned the rebirth-process (
upapatti-bhava). The 2nd and 10th 
propositions, as already pointed out, 
practically teach one and the same thing
, namely, that karma is the cause of 
rebirth; in other words, that the 
karmical volition (cetana^) is the seed 
out of which springs the new life, just 
as from the mango-seed is generated the 
new mango-tree.
Hence, the 5 karmical causes (ignorance,
 etc.) of the past birth are the 
condition for the karma-results of the 
present birth; and the 5 karmical causes
 of the present birth are the condition 
for the 5 karma-results of the next 
birth (s. diagram). As it is said in Vis
.M. XVII:
"Five causes were there in the past,
Five fruits we find in present life;
Five causes do we now produce,
Five fruits we reap in future life."
<pb n="372"/>
 
Now, just as in this process of 
continually changing mental and bodily 
phenomena, nothing can be found that 
would pass from one moment to the next 
moment, so also there is no enduring 
entity, ego, or personality, within this
 process of existence that would 
transmigrate from one life to the next (
s. na^ma-rúpa, anatta^, patisandhi, 
khandha). "No being and no living soul 
passed from the former life to this life
, and yet this present embryo could not 
have entered into existence without the 
preceding causes" (Vis.M. XVII). "Many 
things may serve to illustrate this fact
, as for example the echo, the light of 
a lamp, the impression of a seal, or the
 image produced by a mirror" (ib.).
"Whosoever is in the dark with regard to
 the conditionally arisen things, and 
does not understand that karma 
originates from ignorance, etc., he 
thinks that it must be his ego that 
knows or does not know, acts and causes 
to act, and that arises at rebirth. Or 
he thinks that the atoms, or a creator, 
with the help of this embryonic process,
 must have formed this body, or that it 
is the ego endowed with faculties that 
<pb n="373"/>
has impressions, feels, desires, clings,
 continues and enters again into 
existence in a new birth. Or he thinks 
that all beings have been born through 
fate, or fortuitously" (Vis.M. XVII).
Now, on hearing that Buddhism teaches 
that everything whatever in the world is
 determined by conditions some might 
come to the conclusion that Buddhism 
teaches some sort of fatalism, and that 
man has no free will, or that will is 
not free.
The problem 'whether man has a free will
' does not exist for, the Buddhist, 
since he knows that, apart from these 
everchanging mental and physical 
phenomena, no such entity as 'man' can 
be found, and that 'man' is merely a 
name not relating to any reality. And 
the question, 'whether will is free', 
must be rejected for the reason that '
will', or volition, is a mental 
phenomenon flashing forth only for a 
moment, and that as such it had not any 
existence at the preceding moment. For 
of a thing which is not, or is not yet, 
one cannot, properly speaking, ask 
whether it is free or unfree. The only 
admissible question would be whether the
 arising of 'will' is independent of 
<pb n="374"/>
conditions, or whether it is conditioned
. But the same question would equally 
apply also to all the other mental 
phenomena, as well as to all physical 
phenomena, in other words: to everything
 and every occurrence whatever. And the 
answer would be: whether will arises, or
 whether feeling arises, or whether any 
other mental or any physical phenomenon 
arises, the arising of anything 
whatsoever is dependent on conditions, 
and without conditions nothing ever can 
arise or enter into existence.
According to Buddhism, everything mental
 or physical happens in accordance with 
laws and conditions; and if it were 
otherwise, chaos and blind chance would 
reign. But such a thing is impossible 
and contradicts all laws of thinking. Cf
. Fund. III (end).
 
 
(11.) "Through rebirth are conditioned 
old age and death" (ja^tipaccaya^ jara^-
maranam). Without birth there can be no 
old age and death, no suffering and 
misery. Thus rebirth is to old age and 
death, etc. a condition by way of 
decisive support (upanissaya).
The Buddha has said (D. 15): "Profound, 
<pb n="375"/>
Ananda. is this dependent origination, 
and profound does it appear. It is 
through not understanding, not 
penetrating, this law that this world 
resembles a tangled ball of thread, a 
bird's nest, a thicket of sedge or reed,
 and that man does not escape from the 
lower states of existence, from the 
course of woe and perdition, suffering 
from the round of rebirth." And further 
(M. 28): 'Whoso understands the 
dependent origination understands the 
Dhamma; and whoso understands the Dhamma
 understands the dependent origination."

<xa>patience</xa>
  or forbearance (khanti): one of the 10
 perfections (pa^rami^, q.v.).

<xa>patigha</xa>
  - 1. In an ethical sense, it means: '
repugnance', grudge, resentment, anger, 
and is a synonym of vya^pa^da, 'ill-will
' (s. ni^varana) and dosa, 'hate' (s. mú
la). It is one of the proclivities (
anusaya, q.v.).
2. '(Sense-) reaction'. Applied to five-
sense cognition, p. occurs in the 
following contexts:
(a) as patigha-san~n~a^, 'perception of 
<pb n="376"/>
sense-reaction', said to be absent in 
the immaterial absorptions (s. jha^na 5)
. Alternative renderings: resistance-
perception, reflex-perception;
(b) as patigha-samphassa, '(mental) 
impression caused by 5fold sensorial 
reaction' (D. 15); s. phassa;
(c) as sappatigha-rúpa, 'reacting 
corporeality', and appatigha, 'not 
reacting', which is an Abhidhammic 
classification of corporeality, 
occurring in Dhs. 659, 1050. Sappatigha 
are called the physical sense-organs as 
reacting (or responding) to sense 
stimuli; and also the physical sense-
objects as impinging (or making an 
impact) on the sense-organs. All other 
corporeality is appatigha, non-reacting 
and non-impinging. These 2 terms have 
been variously rendered as resistant and
 not, responding and not, with and 
without impact.

<xa>pa^tiha^riya</xa>
  'miracle', marvel. Three marvels are 
ascribed to the Buddha: the marvel of 
magic (iddhi-p.), the marvel of mind-
reading (a^desana^-p.) and the marvel of
 instruction (anusa^sani^-p.). In D. 11,
 the Buddha says that he sees danger in 
<pb n="377"/>
the first two and therefore abhors them.
 In A. III, 61, the 'marvel of 
instruction' is called the one 'more 
noble and sublime'. For iddhi-pa^tiha^
riya, see D. 25. See also yamakapa^tiha^
riya.

<xa>patikkúla san~n~a^</xa>
 s. ka^yagata^-sati.

<xa>pa^timokkha</xa>
  'Disciplinary Code', is the name of 
the code of monk's rules, which on all 
full-moon and new moon days is recited 
before the assembled community of fully 
ordained monks (bhikkhu).
See The Patimokkha, Romanized Pa^li text
 and transl. by n~a^namoli Thera (
Bangkok 1966, Maha^makut Buddhist 
Bookshop).

<xa>pa^timokkha samvara si^la</xa>
 'morality consisting in restraint with

<xa>patinissagga^nupassana^</xa>
  'contemplation on abandonment', is one
 of the 18 kinds of insight (vipassana^ 
<pb n="378"/>
q.v.). Further cf. the 16th exercise of 
anapana-sati (q.v.).

<xa>patipada^</xa>
  1. 'Road', 'path'; for instance in 
dukkhanirodha-ga^mini^-patipada^, 'the 
road leading to the extinction of 
suffering' (= 4th Noble Truth); majjhima
-patipada^, 'the Middle Way'.
2. 'Progress' (see also the foll. 
article). There are 4 modes of progress 
to deliverance: (1) painful progress 
with slow comprehension (dukkha^ 
patipada^ dandha^bhin~n~a^), (2) painful
 progress with quick comprehension, (3) 
pleasant progress with slow 
comprehension, (4) pleasant progress 
with quick comprehension. In A. IV, 162 
it is said:
(1) "Some person possesses by nature 
excessive greed, excessive hate, 
excessive delusion, and thereby he often
 feels pain and sorrow; and also the 5 
mental faculties, as faith, energy, 
mindfulness, concentration and wisdom (s
. indriya 15-19) are dull in him; and by
 reason thereof he reaches only slowly 
the immediacy (a^nantariya, q.v) to the 
cessation of all cankers.
(2) Some person possesses by nature 
<pb n="379"/>
excessive greed, etc., but the 5 mental 
faculties are sharp in him and by reason
 thereof he reaches quickly the 
immediacy to the cessation of all 
cankers ....
(3) "Some person possesses by nature no 
excessive greed, etc., but the 5 mental 
faculties are dull in him, and by reason
 thereof he reaches slowly the immediacy
 to the cessation of all cankers ....
(4) 'Some person possessess by nature no
 excessive greed, etc., and the mental 
faculties are sharp in him, and by 
reason thereof he reaches quickly the 
immediacy to the cessation of all 
cankers ....

<xa>patipada^ n~a^nadassana visuddhi</xa>
 'purification by knowledge and vision 
of the path-progress' forms the 6th 
stage of purification (visuddhi, q.v.).

<xa>patipannaka</xa>
  'path-attainer', is he who had reached
 one of the 4 supermundane paths of 
holiness (s. ariya-puggala). - (App.)

<xa>patipatti</xa>
<pb n="380"/>
  practice, or 'pursuance' of the 
teaching, as distinguished from the mere
 theoretical knowledge of its wording (
pariyatti, q.v.).

<xa>patipassaddhi paha^na</xa>
 'overcoming (of defilements) by 
tranquillization' (s. paha^na).

<xa>patisambhida^</xa>
  'analytical knowledge' or '
discrimination', is of 4 kinds: 
analytical knowledge of the true meaning
 (attha-patisambhida^), of the law (
dhamma-patisambhida^), of language (
nirutti-patisambhida^), of ready wit (
patibha^na-patisambhida^).
As an alternative rendering of the 
fourth term (patibha^na), Bhikkhu n~a^
namoli proposes: perspicuity (in 
expression and knowledge).
 
1. The analytical knowledge of the 
meaning (attha-p.) is the knowledge with
 regard to the sense.
2. The analytical knowledge of the law (
dhamma-p.) is the knowledge with regard 
to the law.
3. The analytical knowledge of language 
(nirutti-p.) is the knowledge of the 
<pb n="381"/>
language with regard to those former 2 
things.
4. The analytical knowledge of ready-wit
 (patibha^na-p.) is the knowledge about 
the (former 3) kinds of knowledge" (Vibh
. XV).
 
"(1) attha (Sanskrit artha, ? ar, to 
reach; result, meaning, purpose, true 
substance) designates, in short, the 
fruit (phala) of a cause (hetu); for 
since the fruit of a cause results from 
adhering to the cause, and is reached 
and effected thereby, therefore it is 
called result (attha). In particular, 
however, 5 things are considered as 
attha, namely: everything dependent on 
conditions, Nibba^na, the meaning of 
words, karma-result, and functional 
consciousness. When anyone reflects on 
that meaning any knowledge of his, 
falling within the category concerned 
with meaning (or result), is the '
analytical knowledge' of meaning.
"(2) dhamma (Sanskrit dharma, ? dhar, to
 bear; bearer, condition, law, 
phenomenon, thing) is, in short, a name 
for condition (paccaya).... In 
particular, however, 5 things are 
considered as dhamma, namely: every 
<pb n="382"/>
cause (hetu) producing a result, the 
noble path, the spoken word, the 
karmically wholesome, the karmically 
unwholesome. When anyone reflects on 
that law, any knowledge of his, falling 
within the category concerned with law (
or cause), is the 'analytical knowledge'
 of the law.
In Vibh. it is further said: 'The 
knowledge of suffering is the '
analytical knowledge' of the true 
meaning (attha-patisambhida^), the 
knowledge of its origin is the '
analytical knowledge' of the law (dhamma
-patisambhida^). The knowledge of the 
cause is the 'analytical knowledge' of 
the law (dhamma-patisambhida^), the 
knowledge of the result of the cause is 
the 'analytical knowledge' of the true 
meaning (attha-patisambhida^)... That 
the monk knows the law, the sunas etc. 
this is called the 'analytical knowledge
' of the law (dhamma-patisambhida^); if 
however, he understands the meaning of 
this or that speech... it is called the 
'analytical knowledge' of the true 
meaning (attha-patisambhida^).'
(3) " 'The knowledge of the language 
concerning those things' means: the 
language corresponding to reality, and 
<pb n="383"/>
the unfailing mode of expression 
concerning the true meaning and the law.
(4) " 'Knowledge about the kinds of 
knowledges' is that knowledge which has 
all knowledges as object and considers 
them. Or, the analytical knowledge of 
ready wit (patibha^na-patisambhida^) 
means the knowledge of the above 
mentioned 3 kinds of knowledge, in all 
their details, with their objects, 
functions, etc." (Vis.M. XIV).

attainment of the 4 'analytical 
knowledge' , s. A. VII, 37 - See Vis.M.

<xa>patisandhi</xa>
  lit. 'reunion, relinking', i.e. 
rebirth, is one of the 14 functions of 
consciousness (vin~n~a^na-kicca, q.v.). 
It is a karma-resultant type of 
consciousness and arises at the moment 
of conception i.e. with the forming of 
new life in the mother's womb. 
Immediately afterwards it sinks into the
 subconscious stream of existence (
bhavangasota, q.v.), and conditioned 
thereby ever and ever again 
corresponding states of subconsciousness
<pb n="384"/>
 arise. Thus it is really rebirth-
consciousness that determines the latent
 character of a person.
"Neither has this (rebirth-) 
consciousness transmigrated from the 
previous existence to this present 
existence, nor did it arise without such
 conditions, as karma, karma-formations,
 propensity, object, etc. That this 
consciousness has not come from the 
previous existence to this present 
existence, yet that it has come into 
existence by means of conditions 
included in the previous existence, such
 as karma (q.v.), etc., this fact may be
 illustrated by various things, such as 
the echo, the light of a lamp, the 
impression of a seal, or the image 
produced by a mirror. For just as the 
resounding of the echo is conditioned by
 a sound, etc., and nowhere a 
transmigration of sound has taken place,
 just so it is with this consciousness. 
Further it is said: 'In this continuous 
process, no sameness and no otherness 
can be found.' For if there were full 
identity (between the different stages),
 then also milk never could turn into 
curd. And if there were a complete 
otherness, then curd could never come 
<pb n="385"/>
from milk.... If in a continuity of 
existence any karma-result takes place, 
then this karma-result neither belongs 
to any other being, nor does it come 
from any other (kamma), because absolute
 sameness and otherness are excluded 
here" (Vis, XVII 164ff).
In Mil. it is said:
"Now, Venerable Na^gasena, the one who 
is reborn, is he the same as the one who
 has died, or is he another?"
"Neither the same, nor another" (na ca 
so na ca an~n~o).
"Give me an example."
"What do you think, o King: are you now,
 as a grown-up person, the same that you
 had been as a little, young and tender 
babe? "
"No, Venerable Sir. Another person was 
the little, young and tender babe, but 
quite a different person am I now as a 
grown-up man . " . . .
"... Is perhaps in the first watch of 
the night one lamp burning, another one 
in the middle watch, and again another 
one in the last watch?"
"No, Venerable Sir. The light during the
 whole night depends on one and the same
 lamp.''
"Just so, o King, is the chain of 
<pb n="386"/>
phenomena linked together. One 
phenomenon arises, another vanishes, yet
 all are linked together, one after the 
other, without interruption. In this way
 one reaches the final state of 
consciousnes neither as the same person.
 nor as another person.''
According to the nature of their rebirth
 consciousness, beings divide into the 
following 3 groups:
1. ahetu-patisandhika: a 'being reborn 
without rootconditions', is a being 
whose consciousness at the moment of 
rebirth was not accompanied by any of 
the 3 noble rootconditions, viz. 
greedlessness, hatelessness, 
undeludedness (s. múla), i.e. 
selflessness, kindness, intelligence. 
Such beings are found in the 4 lower 
worlds (apa^ya, q.v.), in which case the
 function of rebirth is exercised by the
 class of consciousness listed in Tab. I
 as No. 56. But if such beings are born 
in the sensuous sphere as humans, they 
will be crippled, blind, deaf, mentally 
deficient, etc. (Rebirth-consciousness =
 Tab. I, No. 41)
2. dvihetu (or duhetu)-patisandhika: a '
being reborn with only 2 (noble) root-
conditions', i.e. greedlessness and 
<pb n="387"/>
hatelessness. (Rebirth-consciousness = 
Tab. I, Nos. 44, 45, 48 or 49.)
3. tihetu-patisandhika: a 'being reborn 
with 3 (noble) rootconditions'. Such a 
being can be found only among men. (
Rebirth-consciousness = Tab. 1, Nos. 42,
 43, 46, or 47) and higher heavenly 
beings.
On these 3 types of rebirth, See Atthasa
^lini Tr. 11, 354 - 379. (App.: 
patisandhika).
In the suttas, the terms for rebirth are
 chiefly punabbhava (q.v.), 'renewed 
existence', and abhinibbatti 'arising'; 
or both combined as punabbhava^
bhinibbatti. - (App.: patisandhi).

<xa>patisankha^na</xa>
 bala and bha^vana^ bala: 'power of 
reflection', and 'power of mental 
development'. About these 2 powers it is
<pb n="388"/>
 said in A. II, 10:
"What, o monks, is the power of 
reflection? If, o monks, someone thinks 
thus: 'Bad conduct in deeds, words and 
thoughts verily bears bad fruits both in
 this life, as well as in the next life'
, and in consequence of this 
consideration, he abandons bad conduct 
in deeds, words and thoughts, follows 
good conduct, and keeps his heart pure, 
this, o monks, is the power of 
reflection.
"What, o monks, is the power of mental 
development? If, o monks, a monk 
develops the factors of enlightenment (
bojjhanga, q.v.), bent on solitude, on 
detachment, on extinction, and ending in
 deliverance, namely: mindfulness, 
investigating of the law, energy, 
rapture, tranquillity, concentration, 
and equanimity, this, o monks, is the 
power of mental development."

<xa>patisankha^nupassana^ n~a^na</xa>
 'knowledge consisting in reflective 
contemplation"; is one of the 9 
knowledges constituting the '
purification by knowledge and vision of 
the path-progress' (patipada^-n~a^
nadassanavisuddhi; s. visuddhi VI), and 
<pb n="389"/>
one of the 18 chief kinds of insight (
maha^vipassana^; s. vipassana^).

<xa>pativedha</xa>
  'penetration', signifies the 
realization of the truth of the Dhamma, 
as distinguished from the mere 
acquisition of its wording (pariyatti), 
or the practice (patipatti) of it, in 
other words, realization as 
distinguished from theory and practice. 
Cf. pariyatti.

<xa>patta pindik'anga</xa>
 the 'exercise of the bowl-eater', is 
one of the 13 ascetic purification-
exercises (dhutanga, q.v.), consisting 
in the vow of using only the alms-bowl 
for eating, and the rejection of any 
other vessel.

<xa>patti da^na</xa>
 lit. 'giving of the acquired', i.e. '
transference of merit.' Though in the 
older texts very seldom mentioned (e.g. 
A VII, 50), it is, however, a widespread
 custom in all Buddhist countries. It is
 presumed that moral merit, especially 
that acquired through giving alms, can 
be transferred to others, apparently for
<pb n="390"/>
 the reason that one's own good deeds 
may become to others, especially to 
departed relatives and friends reborn in
 the ghost realm, an inducement to a 
happy and morally wholesome state of 
mind. Transference of merit is advocated
 (though without mentioning the term 
patti-da^na) in the Tirokudda Sutta (Khp
. and Petavatthu) and its Com. (Khp. Tr.
). It is one of the ten 'bases of 
meritorious action' (pun~n~akiriyavatthu
, q.v.), called there patta^nuppada^na. 
(App.).
See 'The Doctrine of Reversible Merit by
 F. L. Woodward. Buddhist Review (London
), Vol. I (1914), p. 38.

<xa>penetration</xa>

power of penetrating (vippha^ra)

<xa>peta</xa>
 (Sanskrit preta): lit. 'departed spirit
', ghost; s. loka.

<xa>petti visaya</xa>
 'ghost realm'; s. loka.

<xa>phala</xa>
  lit. 'fruit'. - 1. result, effect (
often together with hetu, cause ); 2. 
benefit (e.g. in Sa^man~n~a-phala Sutta,
 'The Results, or Benefits, of 
Recluseship'; D. 2).
<pb n="392"/>
As 'path-result', or 'fruition', it 
donotes those moments of supermundane 
consciousness which flash forth 
immediately after the moment of path-
consciousness (s. ariya-puggala) and 
which, till the attainment of the next 
higher path, may during the practice of 
insight (vipassana^, q.v.) still recur 
innumerable times. If thus repeated, 
they are called the 'attainment of 
fruition (phalasama^patti), which is 
explained in detail in Vis.M. XXIII.

<xa>phassa</xa>
 (fr. phusati, to touch): 'sense-
impression', contact. The term samphassa
 is used in compounds, e.g. in the 
following: '"T'here are 6 classes of 
sense-impression: visual impression (
cakkhu-samphassa), impressions of 
hearing, smelling, tasting, bodily (
tactile) impression and mental 
impression" (M. 9). A twofold division 
occurs in D. 15: patigha (q.v.) -
samphassa, impression by sensorial 
reaction', and adhivacana-samphassa, 
verbal (or conceptual, i.e. mental) 
impression'.
Phassa does not signify physical impact,
 but is one of the 7 constant mental 
<pb n="393"/>
concomitants of consciousness (cetasika)
 and belongs to the group of mental 
formations (sankha^ra-kkhandha). In 
lists of both these categories it is 
generally mentioned first (e.g. Dhs. 1: 
M. 9), due to its fundamental position 
in the cognitive process In M. 18 it is 
thus defined: "Dependent on the eye and 
the forms, eye-consciousness arises; the
 coming-together of the three is sense-
impression" (similarly stated in the 
case of the other 5 senses, including 
mind). In the dependent origination, it 
is conditioned by the six sense-bases 
and is a conditioning factor of feeling 
(s. paticca-samuppa^da 5, 6). Its 
relation to mind-and-body (na^ma-rúpa) 
is described in D. 15, and its influence
 on feeling and wrong views, in D. 1 (at
 the end). - It is one of the 4 
nutriments (a^ha^ra, q.v.), and the 
first factor in the pentad of sense-
impression (phassa-pan~camaka), together
 with feeling, perception, volition and 
consciousness (see Abh. St., p. 47ff ).
Being a key function in the mind's 
contact with the world of objects and 
being a potential source of defilements,
 sense-impression is an important 
subject for reflective insight 
<pb n="394"/>
contemplation as succinctly formulated 
in many verses of the Sn.: 736/7, 778, 
851, 870/72, 923.

<xa>picked</xa>

<xa>pindapa^tik'anga</xa>
  The 'practice of going for alms', is

exercises (s. dhutanga).

<xa>pi^ta kasina</xa>
 'yellow-kasina', is one of the kasina-
exercises; s. kasina.

<xa>pi^ti</xa>
  rapture, enthusiasm (rendered also by 
joy, happiness); interest it is one of 
the mental factors or concomitants (
cetasika) and belongs to the group of 
mental formations (sankha^ra-kkhandha). 
As, in sutta texts, it is often linked 
in a compound word. with 'gladness' (pa^
mojja) or 'happiness' (sukha), some 
Western translations have wrongly taken 
it as a synonym of these two terms. Pi^
ti, however, is not a feeling or a 
sensation, and hence does not belong to 
<pb n="395"/>
the feeling-group (vedana^-kkhandha), 
but may be described psychologically as 
'joyful interest'. As such it may be 
associated with wholesome as well as 
with unwholesome and neutral states of 
consciousness.
A high degree of rapture is 
characteristic of certain stages in 
meditative concentration, in insight 
practice (vipassana^) as well as in the 
first two absorptions (jha^na, q.v.). In
 the latter it appears as one of the 
factors of absorption (jha^nanga; s. jha
^na) and is strongest in the 2nd 
absorption. Five degrees of intensity in
 meditative rapture are described in Vis
.M. IV. 94ff. It is one of the factors 
of enlightenment (bojjhanga, q.v.).

of the disciple, s. foll.

<xa>progress</xa>
 of the disciple, Gradual development of
 the Eightfold Path in the: In many 
suttas occurs an identical passage that 
outlines the gradual course of 
development in the progress of the 
disciple. There it is shown how this 
development takes place gradually, and 
in conformity with laws, from the very 
first hearing of the doctrine, and from 
germinating faith and dim comprehension,
 up to the final realization of 
<pb n="398"/>
deliverance.
"After hearing the law, he is filled 
with confidence, and he thinks: 'Full of
 hindrances is household life, a refuse 
heap; but the homeless life (of a monk) 
is like the open air. Not easy is it, 
when one lives at home, to fulfill in 
all points the rules of the holy life. 
How if now I were to cut off hair and 
beard, put on the yellow robe, and go 
forth from home to the homeless life?' 
And after a short time, having given up 
his possessions, great or little, having
 forsaken a circle of relations, small 
or large, he cuts off hair and beard, 
puts on the yellow robe, and goes forth 
from home to the homeless life.
Having thus left the world, he fulfills 
the rules of the monks. He avoids the 
killing of living beings and abstains 
from it; without stick or sword, 
conscientious, full of sympathy, he is 
desirous of the welfare of all living 
beings. He avoids stealing ... avoids 
unchastity ... avoids lying ... tale-
bearing ... harsh language ... vain talk
.
"He abstains from destroying vegetal 
germs and plants; eats only at one time 
of the day; keeps aloof from dance, song
<pb n="399"/>
, music and the visiting of shows; 
rejects floral adornment, perfumes, 
ointment, as well as any other kind of 
adornment and embellishment. High and 
gorgeous beds he does not use. Gold and 
silver he does not accept ... keeps 
aloof from buying and selling things ...
.
"He contents himself with the robe that 
protects his body, and with the alms-
bowl with which he keeps himself alive. 
Wherever he goes, he is provided with 
these two things, just as a winged bird 
in flying carries its wings along with 
him.
"By fulfilling this noble domain of 
morality (si^la) he feels in his heart 
an irreproachable happiness."
In what follows thereafter it is shown 
how the disciple watches over his 5 
senses and his mind, and by this noble 
restraint of the senses (indriya-samvara
) feels in his heart an unblemished 
happiness; how in all his actions he is 
ever mindful and clearly conscious; and 
how, being equipped with this lofty 
morality (si^la), and with this noble 
restraint of the senses (indriya-samvara
), and with mindfulness and clear 
consciousness (sati-sampajan~n~a), he 
<pb n="400"/>
choses a secluded dwelling, and freeing 
his mind from the 5 hindrances (ni^
varana, q.v.) he reaches full 
concentration (sama^dhi, q.v.); and how 
thereafter, by developing insight (
vipassana^ q.v.) with regard to the 
impermanency (anicca), misery (dukkha) 
and impersonality (anatta^, q.v.) of all
 phenomena of existence, he finally 
realizes deliverance from all cankers 
and defilements, and thus the assurance 
arises in him:
"For ever am I liberated,
This is the last time I am born,
No new existence waits for me."
Cf. D.1, 2f; M. 27, 38, 51, 60, 76; A.

  'remembrance of former births', is one

<xa>puggala</xa>
  'individual', 'person', as well as the
<pb n="401"/>
 synonyms: personality, individuality, 
being (satta), self (atta^), etc., in 
short all terms designating a personal 
entity, hence also: I, you, he, man, god
, etc., all these, according to Buddhism
, are mere names for certain 
combinations of material and mental 
processes, and apart from them they have
 no real existence. They are to be 
considered as mere 'conventional modes 
of expression' (voha^ra-vacana), and on 
that level they may be used, and are so 
used in the sutta texts, if taken "
without misapprehending them" (s. quote 
from D. 9 under paramattha). With such 
tacit reservations, the term puggala 
occurs quite frequently in the suttas.
In the ultimate sense (paramattha, q.v.)
, however, there exist only ever-
changing physical and mental phenomena, 
flashing up and dying every moment. - 
Kath., in its first section, discusses 
the question whether "in the absolute 
sense, any personality (puggala) can be 
found" (s. Guide, pp. 62ff). - See 
paramattha, anatta^.

<xa>púja^</xa>
  (1) honour, respect, homage, (2) 
worship, devotional observances, 
<pb n="402"/>
devotional offerings; also offerings to 
monks.
(1) The Maha^-mangala Sutta (Sn. 259) 
says that "Honour and respect towards 
those worthy of it, is conducive to 
great blessing" (púja^ ca pújaniyesu 
etam mangalam uttamarn). See Dhp. 195f.
(2) The Buddha did not think much of 
mere outer worship. "Not thus, Ananda, 
is the Tatha^gata respected, venerated, 
esteemed, worshipped and honoured in the
 highest degree. But, Ananda, whatsoever
 bhikkhu or bhikkhuni, lay man or lay 
woman, abides by the Teaching, lives 
uprightly in the Teaching, walks in the 
way of the Teaching, it is by him that 
the Tatha^gata is respected, venerated, 
esteemed, worshipped and honoured in the
 highest degree" (D. 16). - "There are 
two kinds of worship: in a material way 
(a^misa-púja^) and through (practice of)
 the Dhamma (dhamma-púja^). The worship 
through (practice of) the Dhamma is the 
better of the two" (A. II).

<xa>punabbhava</xa>
  lit.: re-becoming; 'renewed existence'
, is a sutta term for 'rebirth', which, 
in later literature mostly is called 
patisandhi (q.v.). The attainment of 
<pb n="403"/>
Sainthood (arahatta), implying the end 
of future rebirths, is often expressed 
in the words: "This is the last birth. 
Now there is no more a renewed existence
!" (natthi 'da^ni punabbhavo) (M. 26; D.
 15; Therag. 87, 339; Sn. 502). - The 
term is often linked with abhinibbatti (
'arising').
"But how, o brother, does it come to 
renewed existence and arising in the 
future (a^yatim punabbhava^bhinibbatti)?
 Because beings, obstructed by ignorance
 and fettered by craving, find ever 
fresh delight now here, now there, for 
this reason there is renewed existence 
and arising in the future" (M. 43). See 
also S.XII. 38. Abhinibbatti also stands
 sometimes alone in signifying 'rebirth'
, e.g. in A. VI, 61; X, 65.
Cf., in the 2nd Truth, the adj. 
ponobhavika, 'leading to renewed 
existence'.
See A. III, 76; Sn. 163, 273, 514, 733; 
S. VII, 12; X, 3.

<xa>pun~n~a</xa>
  merit, meritorious, is a popular term 
for karmically wholesome (kusala) action
. Opposite terms: apun~n~a, 'demerit'; 
pa^pa, 'bad', 'evil', The value of 
<pb n="404"/>
meritorious action is often stressed, e.
g., in the Treasure Store Sutta (s. Khp.
 Tr.), Dhp 18, 118, 122. - The Community
 of Holy Monks (ariya-sangha), the third
 Refuge (s. ti-sarana), is said to be "
the incomparable field of merit in the 
world" (anuttaram pun~n~akkhettam 
lokassa); s. anussati 3. The Arahats, 
however, having transcended all life-
affirming and rebirth-producing actions,
 are said to be "beyond merit and 
demerit"; see Sn. 520, 547, 636, 790. - 
See foll. 3 articles.

<xa>pun~n~a^bhisankha^ra</xa>
  'meritorious karma-formations' of the 
sensuous and fine-material sphere; s. 
sankha^ra I. 1.

<xa>pun~n~a^ dha^ra^</xa>
 'streams of merit'. It is said that one
 produces 4 streams of merit by offering
 the 4 requisites (robes, almsfood, 
dwelling, medicine) to a monk who has 
reached the conditionless deliverance of
 mind; further by being filled with 
unshakable faith in the Buddha, his 
doctrine and community of disciples, and
 by being perfect in morality (A. IV, 51
, 52). A. VIII, 39 describes 4 further 
<pb n="405"/>
streams of merit.

<xa>pun~n~a kiriya vatthu</xa>
 'bases of meritorious action'. In the 
suttas, 3 are mentioned consisting of 
giving (liberality; da^na-maya-p.), of 
morality (si^la-maya-p.) and of mental 
development (meditation; bha^vana^-maya-
p.). See D. 33; It. 60; expl. in A. VIII
, 36.
Commentaries have a list of ten (dasa p.
) which is very popular in Buddhist 
countries: (1)-(3) as above, (4) 
reverence (apaciti), (5) service (veyya^

^nuppada^na), (7) rejoicing in others' 
merit (abbha^numodana), (8) expounding 
the Doctrine (desana^), (9) listening to

"Whoso is neither freed from the 3

According to Com. to M. 9, a 'worlding' 
may be (1) an outsider (a non-Buddhist) 
who, if he believed in moral causation, 
may be said to have right view to that

who professes Buddhism, may be either a 
'blind worldling' (andha-p.) who has 
neither knowledge of, nor interest in 
the fundamental teaching (the Truths, 
groups, etc.); or he is a 'noble 
worldling' (kalya^na-p.), who has such 
knowledge and earnestly strives to 
understand and practise the Teaching. -

<pb n="412"/>
 'corporeal group', material unit, 
designates a combination of several 
physical phenomena constituting a 
temporary unity. Thus, for instance, the
 so-called 'dead matter' forms the most 
primitive group, consisting only of 8 
physical phenomena, called the 'pure 
eightfold unit' or 'octad' (
suddhatthakakala^pa), to wit: the 4 
elements (the solid, fluid, heat, motion
); colour, smell, taste, nutriment (
pathavi^, a^po, tejo, va^yo; vanna, 
gandha, rasa, oja^). In Vis.M., and 
elsewhere, it is also called ojatthamaka
-kala^pa, 'the octad with nutriment as 
the 8th factor'.
The simplest form of living matter is 
the '9-fold vitality unit' or 'life-
ennead' (ji^vita-navaka-kala^pa), formed
 by adding 'vitality' to the octad. 
Seven decades, or units of ten (dasaka-
kala^pa), are formed by adding to the 9-
fold unit one of the following corporeal
 phenomena: heart (physical seat of mind
), sex, eye, ear, nose, tongue or body.

<xa>sacca</xa>
  'Truth'. - 1. On the 'two truths', 
conventional and ultimale, see 
paramattha.
2. 'The Four Noble Truths' (ariya-sacca)
 are the briefest synthesis of the 
entire teachings of Buddhism, since all 
those manifold doctrines of the 
threefold canon are, without any 
exception, included therein. They are: 
the truth of suffering, of the origin of
 suffering, of the extinction of 
suffering, and of the Eightfold Path 
leading to the extinction of suffering.
I. The 1st truth, briefly stated, 
teaches that all forms of existence 
whatsoever are unsatisfactory and 
subject to suffering (dukkha).
II. The 2nd truth teaches that all 
<pb n="415"/>
suffering, and all rebirth, is produced 
by craving (tanha^).
III. The 3rd truth teaches that 
extinction of craving necessarily 
results in extinction (nirodha) of 
rebirth and suffering, i.e. nibba^na (q.
v.).
IV. The 4th truth of the Eightfold Path 
(magga) indicates the means by which 
this extinction is attained.
The stereotype text frequently recurring
 in the Sutta Pitaka, runs as follows:
I. "But what, o monks, is the noble 
truth of suffering? Birth is suffering, 
decay is suffering, death is suffering; 
sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and 
despair are suffering; in short, the 5 
groups of existence connected with 
clinging are suffering (cf. dukkha, 
dukkhata).
II. ''But what, o monks, is the noble 
truth of the origin of suffering? It is 
that craving which gives rise to fresh 
rebirth and, bound up with lust and 
greed, now here, now there, finds ever 
fresh delight. It is the sensual craving
 (ka^ma-tanha^), the craving for 
existence (bhava-tanha^), the craving 
for non-existence or self-annihilation (
vibhava-tanha^).
<pb n="416"/>
III. "But what, o monks, is the noble 
truth of the extinction of suffering? It
 is the complete fading away and 
extinction of this craving, its 
forsaking and giving up, liberation and 
detachment from it.
IV. "But what, o monks, is the noble 
truth of the path leading to the 
extinction of suffering? It is the Noble
 Eightfold Path (ariya-atthangika-magga)
 that leads to the extinction of 
suffering, namely:
 
1. Right view (samma^-ditthi)2. Right 
thought (samma^-sankappa)	III. Wisdom (
pan~n~a^)
3. Right speech (samma^-va^ca^)4. Right 
action (samma^-kammanta)5. Right 
livelihood (sammd-djiva)	 I. Morality (
si^la)
6. Right effort (samma^-va^ya^ma)7. 
Right mindfulness (samma^-sati)8. Right 
concentration (samma^-sama^dhi)	 II. 
Concentration (sama^dhi)
 
 
1. "What now, o monks, is right view (or
 right understanding)? It is the 
understanding of suffering, of the 
origin of suffering, of the extinction 
<pb n="417"/>
of suffering, and of the path leading to
 the extinction of suffering.
2. "What now, o monks, is right thought?
 It is a mind free from sensual lust, 
ill-will and cruelty.
3. "What now, o monks, is right speech? 
Abstaining from lying, tale-bearing, 
harsh words, and foolish babble (cf. 
tiraccha^nakatha^).
4. "What now, o monks, is right action? 
Abstaining from injuring living beings, 
from stealing and from unlawful sexual 
intercourse (s. ka^mesu miccha^ca^ra).
5. "What now, o monks, is right 
livelihood? If the noble disciple 
rejects a wrong living, and gains his 
living by means of right livelihood (s. 
magga, 5).
6. "What now, o monks, is right effort? 
If the disciple rouses his will to avoid
 the arising of evil, demeritorious 
things that have not yet arisen; ... if 
he rouses his will to overcome the evil,
 demeritorious things that have already 
arisen; ... if he rouses his will to 
produce meritorious things that have not
 yet arisen; ... if he rouses his will 
to maintain the meritorious things that 
have already arisen and not to let them 
disappear, but to bring them to growth, 
<pb n="418"/>
to maturity and to the full perfection 
of development; he thus makes effort, 
stirs up his energy, exerts his mind and
 strives (s. padha^na).
7. "What now, o monks is right 
mindfulness? If the disciple dwells in 
contemplation of corporeality ... of 
feeling ... of mind ... of the mind-
objects, ardent, clearly conscious, and 
mindful after putting away worldly greed
 and grief (s. satipattha^na).
8. "What now, o monks, is right 
concentration? If the disciple is 
detached from sensual objects, detached 
from unwholesome things, and enters into
 the first absorption ... the second 
absorption ... the third absorption ... 
the fourth absorption" (s. jha^na).
In the Buddha's first sermon, the 
Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, it is said 
that the first truth (suffering) is to 
be fully understood; the second truth (
craving) to be abandoned; the third 
truth (Nibba^na) to be realized; the 
fourth truth (the path) to be cultivated
.
"The truth of suffering is to be 
compared with a disease, the truth of 
the origin of suffering with the cause 
of the disease, the truth of extinction 
<pb n="419"/>
of suffering with the cure of the 
disease, the truth of the path with the 
medicine" (Vis.M. XVI).
In the ultimate sense, all these 4 
truths are to be considered as empty of 
a self, since there is no feeling agent,
 no doer, no liberated one. no one who 
follows along the path. Therefore it is 
said:
'Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is 
found.
The deed is, but no doer of the deed is 
there.
Nibba^na is, but not the man that enters
 it.
The path is, but no traveller on it is 
seen.
 
'The first truth and the second truth 
are empty
Of permanency, joy, of self and beauty;
The Deathless Realm is empty of an ego,
And free from permanency, joy and self, 
the path.'
(Vis.M. XVI)
 
It must be pointed out that the first 
truth does not merely refer to actual 
suffering, i.e. to suffering as feeling,
 but that it shows that, in consequence 
<pb n="420"/>
of the universal law of impermanency, 
all the phenomena of existence 
whatsoever, even the sublimest states of
 existence, are subject to change and 
dissolution, and hence are miserable and
 unsatisfactory; and that thus, without 
exception, they all contain in 
themselves the germ of suffering. Cf. 
Guide, p. 101f.

<xa>sacca n~a^na</xa>
 'knowledge of the truth' (s. prec.), 
may be of 2 kinds: (1) knowledge 
consisting in understanding (anubodha-n~
a^na) and (2) knowledge consisting in 
penetration (pativedha-n~a^na), i.e. 
realization. Cf. pariyatti.
"Amongst these, (1) 'knowledge 
consisting in understanding' is mundane 
(lokiya, q.v.), and its arising with 
regard to the extinction of suffering, 
<pb n="421"/>
and to the path, is due to hearsay etc. 
(therefore not due to one's realization 
of the supermundane path; s. ariya-
puggala) (2) 'Knowledge consisting in 
penetration', however, is supermundane (
lokuttara), with the extinction of 
suffering (= nibba^na) as object, it 
penetrates with its functions the 4 
truths (in one and the same moment), as 
it is said (S. LVI, 30): whosoever, o 
monks, understands suffering, he also 
understands the origin of suffering, the
 extinction of suffering, and the path 
leading to the extinction of suffering' 
" (Vis.M. XVI, 84). See visuddhi (end of
 article).
"Of the mundane kinds of knowledge, 
however, the knowledge of suffering by 
which (various) prejudices are overcome,
 dispels the personality-belief (sakka^
ya-dilthi, s. ditthi). The knowledge of 
the origin of suffering dispels the 
annihilation-view (uccheda-ditthi, s. 
ditthi); the knowledge of extinction of 
suffering, the eternity-view (sassata-
ditthi, s. ditthi); the knowledge of the
 path, the view of inefficacy of action 
(akiriya-ditthi, s. ditthi)" (Vis.M. XVI
, 85).

 anuloma-n~a^na (q.v.), puthujjana.

<xa>sacchikarani^ya^ dhamma^</xa>
 'things to be realized'. Recollection 
of former states of existence is to be 
realized through remembrance (abhin~n~a^
 4; q.v.). The vanishing and reappearing
 of beings is to be realized through the
 divine eye (abhin~n~a^ 5; q.v.). The 8 
deliverances (vimokkha, q.v.) are to be 
realized through the mental group (ka^ya
, here feeling, perception, mental 
formations; s. ka^ya). The extinction of
 cankers is to be realized through 
insight (vipassana^).

<xa>saddha^</xa>
  faith, confidence. A Buddhist is said 
to have faith if "he believes in the 
Perfect One's (the Buddha's) 
Enlightenment" (M 53; A.V, 2), or in the
 Three Jewels (s. ti-ratana), by taking 
his refuge in them (s. ti-sarana). His 
faith, however, should be "reasoned and 
rooted in understanding" (a^ka^ravata^ 
saddha^ dassanamúlika; M. 47), and he is
 asked to investigate and test the 
object of his faith (M. 47, 95). A 
Buddhist's faith is not in conflict with
<pb n="423"/>
 the spirit of inquiry, and "doubt about
 dubitable things" (A. II, 65; S. XLII, 
13) is admitted and inquiry into them is
 encouraged. The 'faculty of faith' (
saddhindriya) should be balanced with 
that of wisdom (pan~n~indriya; s. 
indriya-samatta). It is said: "A monk 
who has understanding, establishes his 
faith in accordance with that 
understanding" (S. XLVIII, 45). Through 
wisdom and understanding, faith becomes 
an inner certainty and firm conviction 
based on one's own experience.
Faith is called the seed (Sn. v. 77) of 
all wholesome states because, according 
to commentarial explanations, it 
inspires the mind with confidence (
okappana, pasa^da) and determination (
adhimokkha), for 'launching out' (
pakkhandhana; s. M. 122) to cross the 
flood of samsa^ra.
Unshakable faith is attained on reaching
 the first stage of holiness, 'stream-
entry' (sota^patti, s. ariyapuggala), 
when the fetter of sceptical doubt (
vicikiccha^; s. samyojana) is eliminated
. Unshakable confidence (avecca-pasa^da)
 in the Three Jewels is one of the 
characteristic qualities of the Stream-
winner (sota^pannassa anga^ni, q.v.).
<pb n="424"/>
Faith is a mental concomitant, present 
in all karmically wholesome, and its 
corresponding neutral, consciousness (s.
 Tab. II). It is one of the 4 streams of
 merit (pun~n~adha^ra^, q.v.), one of 
the 5 spiritual faculties (indriya, q.v.
), spiritual powers (bala, q.v.), 
elements of exertion (padha^niyanga, q.v
.) and one of the 7 treasures (dhana, q.
v.).
See Faith in the Buddha's Teaching, by 
Soma Thera (WHEEL 262). "Does Saddha^ 
mean Faith?'' by n~a^namoli Thera (in 
WHEEL 52/53).

<xa>saddha^nusa^ri</xa>

 'own group' or 'own body'. In the 
suttas (e.g. M. 44) it is said to be a 
name for the 5 groups of existence (
khandha): "Sakka^ya, o Brother Visa^kha,
 is said by the Blessed One to be a name
 for the 5 'groups as objects of 
clinging' (upa^da^na-kkhandha), to wit: 
corporeality, feeling, perception,

 See foll.

<xa>sakka^ya ditthi</xa>
 'personality-belief', is the first of 
<pb n="426"/>
the 10 fetters (samyojana). It is 
entirely abandoned only on reaching the 
path of Stream-winning (sota^patti-magga
; s. ariya-puggala). There are 20 kinds 
of personality-belief, which are 
obtained by applying 4 types of that 
belief to each of the 5 groups of 
existence (khandha, q.v.): (1-5) the 
belief to be identical with corporeality
, feeling, perception, mental formations
 or consciousness; (6-10) to be 
contained in them; (11-15) to be 
independent of them; (16-20) to be the 
owner of them (M. 44; S. XXII. 1). See 
prec., ditthi, upa^da^na 4.

<xa>sala^yatana</xa>

 a^yatana, paticcasamuppa^da.

<xa>sama^dhi</xa>
  'concentration'; lit. 'the (mental) 
state of being firmly fixed' (sam+a^+? 
ha^), is the fixing of the mind on a 
single object. "One-pointedness of mind 
(cittass' ekaggata^), Brother Visakha, 
this is called concentration" (M. 44). 
Concentration - though often very weak -
 is one of the 7 mental concomitants 
inseparably associated with all 
<pb n="427"/>
consciousness. Cf. na^ma, cetana^.
Right concentration (samma^-sama^dhi), 
as the last link of the 8-fold Path (s. 
magga), is defined as the 4 meditative 
absorptions (jha^na, q.v.). In a wider 
sense, comprising also much weaker 
states of concentration, it is 
associated with all karmically wholesome
 (kusala) consciousness. Wrong 
concentration (miccha^-sama^dhi) is 
concentration associated with all 
karmically unwholesome (akusala, q.v.) 
consciousness. Wherever in the texts 
this term is not differentiated by '
right' or 'wrong', there 'right' 
concentration is meant .
In concentration one distinguishes 3 
grades of intensity:
(1) 'Preparatory concentration' (
parikamma-sama^dhi) existing at the 
beginning of the mental exercise.
(2) 'Neighbourhood concentration' (upaca
^ra-sama^dhi), i.e. concentration '
approaching' but not yet attaining the 
1st absorption (jha^na, q.v.), which in 
certain mental exercises is marked by 
the appearance of the so-called 'counter
-image' (patibha^ga-nimitta).
(3) 'Attainment concentration' (appana^-
sama^dhi), i.e. that concentration which
<pb n="428"/>
 is present during the absorptions. (App
.)
Further details, s. bha^vana, Vis.M. III
 and Fund. IV.
Concentration connected with the 4 noble
 path-moments (magga), and fruition-
moments (phala), is called supermundane 
(lokuttara), having Nibba^na as object. 
Any other concentration, even that of 
the sublimest absorptions is merely 
mundane (lokiya, q.v.).
According to D. 33, the development of 
concentration (sama^dhi-bha^vana^) may 
procure a 4-fold blessing: (1) present 
happiness through the 4 absorptions; (2)
 knowledge and vision (n~a^na-dassana) -
 here probably identical with the '
divine eye' (s. abhin~n~a^) through 
perception of light (kasina); (3) 
mindfulness and clear comprehension 
through the clear knowledge of the 
arising, persisting and vanishing of 
feelings, perceptions and thoughts; (4) 
extinction of all cankers (a^savakkhaya)
 through understanding the arising and 
passing away of the 5 groups forming the
 objects of clinging (s. khandha).
Concentration is one of the 7 factors of
 enlightenment (bojjhanga, q.v.), one of
 the 5 spiritual faculties and powers (s
<pb n="429"/>
. bala), and the last link of the 8-fold
 Path. In the 3-fold division of the 8-
fold Path (morality, concentration and 
wisdom), it is a collective name for the
 three last links of the path (s. sikkha
^).

<xa>sa^man~n~a</xa>
 phala; the 'fruits of monkhood', is the
 name of a famous sutta (D. 2) and also,
 according to D. 33, a name for the 4 
supermundane fruitions: Stream-entrance,
 Once-return, Non-return, and Perfect 
Holiness (s. ariya-puggala).

<xa>sama^patti</xa>
  'attainments', is a name for the 8 
absorptions of the fine-material and 
immaterial spheres to which occasionally
 is added as 9th attainment, attainment 
of extinction (nirodhasama^patti) Cf. 
jha^na.

<xa>sama si^si^</xa>
 one 'who attains two ends 
simultaneously', namely: the extinction 
of cankers and the end of life (s. Pug. 
19). In A. VIII, 6 it is said: "Such is 
the case with a monk who dwells in the 
contemplation of impermanency of all 
forms of existence, keeping before his 
eyes their impermanency, perceiving 
their impermanency, perseveringly, 
steadfastly, undisturbed, of firm mind, 
wisely absorbed; and in whom at one and 
<pb n="431"/>
the same time the extinction of cankers 
and the end of like take place." (App.)

<xa>samatha</xa>
  'tranquillity', serenity, is a synonym
 of sama^dhi (coneentration), 
cittekaggata^ (one-pointedness of mind) 
and avikkhepa (undistractedness). It is 
one of the mental factors in 'wholesome 
consciousness. Cf. foll. and bha^vana^.

<xa>samatha vipassana^</xa>
 'tranquillity and insight', are 
identical with concentration (sama^dhi, 
q.v.; s. prec.) and wisdom (pan~n~a^, q.
v.), and form the two branches of mental
 development (bha^vana^, q.v.).
(1) 'Tranquillity' is all unperturbed, 
peaceful and lucid state of mind 
attained by strong mental concentration.
 Though as a distinct way of practice (s
. samatha-ya^nika), it aims at the 
attainment of the meditative absorptions
 (jha^na, q.v.), a high degree of 
tranquil concentration (though not 
necessarily that of the absorptions) is 
indispensable for insight too. 
Tranquillity frees the mind from 
impurities and inner obstacles, and 
gives it greater penetrative strength.
<pb n="432"/>
''What now is the power of tranquillity 
(samatha-bala)? It is the one-
pointedness and non-distraction of the 
mind due to freedom from desire (
renunciation) ... to freedom from ill-
will ... to the perception of light (s. 
aloka-san~n~a^) ... to non-distraction .
.. to the defilling of phenomena ... to 
knowledge, gladness, the 8 attainments, 
the 10 kasinas, the 10 recollections, 
the 9 cemetery contemplations, the 32 
kinds of respiration-mindfulness ... the
 one-pointedness and non-distraction of 
the mind of one contemplating 
abandonment (relinquishment) while 
inhaling and exhaling (s. a^na^pa^nasati
).
"The power of tranquillity consists of 
the freedom from perturbation; in the 
1st absorption, from the 5 hindrances (
ni^varana, (q.v.); in the 2nd absorption
, from thought-conception and discursive
 thinking; ... in the sphere of neither-
perception-nor-non-perception it 
consists of the freedom from 
perturbation by the perception of the 
sphere of nothingness (s. 
anupubbanirodha), which is no longer 
agitated and irritated by defilements 
associated with restlessness, nor by the
<pb n="433"/>
 groups of existence" (Pts.M. 1. p. 97)
(2) 'Insight' (s. vipassana^) is the 
penetrative understanding by direct 
meditative experience of the 
impermanency, unsatisfactoriness and 
impersonality of all material and mental
 phenomena of existence. It is insight 
that leads to entrance into the 
supermundance states of holiness and to 
final liberation.
''What now is the power of insight? It 
is the contemplation of impermanency (
anicca^nupassana^), of misery (
dukkhanupassana^), impersonality' (
anatta^nupassana^), of aversion (
nibbidanupassana^), detachment (vira^
ganupassana^), extinction (nirodha), 
ahandonment (patinissagga), with regard 
to corporcality, feeling, perception, 
mental formations and consciousness.... 
That in contemplating the impermanency 
one is no more agitated by the idea of 
grasping ... no more by ignorance and 
the defilements associated therewith and
 no more by the groups of existence: 
this is called the power of insight" (
Pts.M. p. 97).
"Two things are conducive to knowledge: 
tranquillity and insight. If 
tranquillity is developed, what profit 
<pb n="434"/>
does it bring? The mind is developed. If
 the mind is developed, what profit does
 it bring? All lust is abandoned.
"If insight is developed, what profit 
does it bring? Wisdom is developed. If 
wisdom is developed, what profit does it
 bring? All ignorance is abandoned" (A. 
II, 2.7).
There is a method of meditative practice
 where, in alternating sequence, 
tranquillity-meditation and insight-
meditation are developed. It is called '
tranquillity and insight joined in pairs
' (samatha-vipassana^yuganaddha), the 
coupling or yoking of tranquillity and 
insight. He who undertakes it, first 
enters into the 1st absorption. After 
rising from it, he contemplates the 
mental phenomena that were present in it
 (feeling, perception, etc.) as 
impermanent, painful and not-self, and 
thus he develops insight. Thereupon he 
enters into the 2nd absorption; and 
after rising from it, he again considers
 its constituent phenomena as 
impermanent, etc. In this way, he passes
 from one absorption to the next, until 
at last, during a moment of insight, the
 intuitive knowledge of the path (of 
Stream-entry, etc.) flashes forth - See 
<pb n="435"/>
A. IV, 170; A.IX, 36; Pts: Yuganaddha 
Katha^.

<xa>samatha ya^nika</xa>
 'one who takes tranquillity as his 
vehicle'. This is a name for a person 
who not only has reached insight but 
also one or the other of the absorptions
, to distinguish him from one 'who 
practises only insight' (sukkha-
vipassaka, q.v.).

<xa>samma^ sambodhi</xa>
 'Perfect Enlightenment', Universal 
Buddhahood, is the state attained by a 
Universal Buddha (samma^-sambuddha), i.e
. one by whom the liberating law (dhamma
) which had become lost to the world, 
has again been discovered, realized and 
clearly proclaimed to the world.
"Now, someone, in things never heard 
before, understands by himself the truth
, and he therein attains omniscience, 
and gains mastery in the powers. Such a 
one is called a Universal Buddha, or 
Enlightened One" (Pug. 29).
The doctrine characteristie of all the 
Buddhas, and each time rediscovered by 
them and fully explained to the world, 
consists in the 4 Truths (sacca, q.v.) 
of suffering, its origin, its extinction
 and the way to its extinction (s. magga
). See bodhi.

<xa>sammasana</xa>
  'comprehension', exploring, '
determining' (vavattha^na, q.v.) is a 
name for the determining of all 
phenomena of existence as impermanent, 
miserable and impersonal (anicca, dukkha
, anatta^), etc., which is the beginning
 of insight (s. Pts.M. I, p. 53; Vis.M. 
<pb n="437"/>
XX); also called kala^pa-s. (q.v.), '
comprehension by groups (of existence -

<xa>sampada^</xa>
  'attainment, blessing'. The 5 
blessings are said to be faith, morality
, learning, liberality, wisdom (A. V, 91
). Further: morality, concentration, 
wisdom, deliverance, the eye of 
knowledge connected with deliverance (A.
 V, 92).

<xa>sampajan~n~a</xa>
  'clarity of consciousness', clear 
comprehension. This term is frequently 
met with in combination with mindfulness
 (sati). In D. 22, M. 10 it is said: "
Clearly conscious is he in going and 
coming, clearly conscious in looking 
forward and backward, clearly conscious 
<pb n="438"/>
in bending and stretching his body; 
clearly conscious in eating, drinking, 
chewing and tasting, clearly conscious 
in discharging excrement and urine; 
clearly conscious in walking, standing, 
sitting, falling asleep and awakening; 
clearly conscious in speaking and 
keeping silent." - For a definition of 
the term sati-sampajan~n~a, s. Pug. 86.
According to the Com., 'clarity of 
consciousness' is of 4 kinds: regarding 
the purpose, the suitability, (inclusion
 in the meditative) domain, and the 
undeluded conception of the activity 
concerned. Explained in detail in Com. 
to Satipattha^na Sutta. (tr. in The Way 
of Mindfulness, by Soma Thera; BPS).

<xa>sampaticchana citta</xa>
 'receptive consciousness', is the 
mindelement (mano-dha^tu) that follows

<xa>samsa^ra</xa>
  'round of rebirth', lit. perpetual 
wandering', is a name by which is 
designated the sca of life ever 
restlessly heaving up and down, the 
symbol of this continuous process of 
ever again and again being born, growing
 old, suffering and dying. More 
precisely put, samsa^ra is the unbroken 
chain of the five-fold khandha-
combinations, which, constantly changing
 from moment to moment follow 
continuously one upon the other through 
inconceivable periods of time. Of this 
samsa^ra, a single lifetime constitutes 
only a tiny and fleeting fraction; hence
 to be able to comprehend the first 
noble truth of universal suffering, one 
must let one's gaze rest upon the samsa^
ra, upon this frightful chain of 
rebirths, and not merely upon one single
 life-time, which, of course, may be 
sometimes less painful. - Cf. tilakkhana
, anatta^, paramattha, patisandhi.

<pb n="440"/>
<xa>samseva</xa>
  'companionship'. (1) "Through 
companionship with bad men (asappurisa-s
.) comes listening to bad advice, 
thereby unwise reflection, thereby 
inattention and mental confusion, 
thereby lack of sense-control, thereby 3
-fold bad conduct in bodily action, 
speech and mind, thereby the 5 
hindrances (ni^varana, q.v.), thereby 
craving for existence. (2) Through 
companionship with good men (sappurisa-s

thereby faith, thereby wise reflection, 
thereby mindfulness and clarity of 
consciousness, thereby sense-control, 
thereby 3-fold good conduct, thereby the

<xa>samuccheda paha^na</xa>
 'overcoming by destruction', is the

  'origination'. There are 4 kinds of 
origination of corporeal phenomena, 
namely: through karma, consciousness, 
temperature, nutriment. For example, '
karma-produced' (kamma-s. = kammaja, 
karma-born) are the sense organs, sexual
 characteristics, etc., which, according
 to their nature, are conditioned either
 through wholesome or unwholesome karma 
formations (volitional actions; s. 
paticcasamuppa^da, 2) in a previous 
existence. 'Mindproduced', i.e. 
consciousness-produced (citta-samuttha^

<xa>samvejani^ya ttha^na</xa>
 'places rousing emotion', are 4: the 
place where the Perfect One was born, (i

place where he reached Full 
Enlightenment (i.e. Uruvela, the modern 
<pb n="443"/>
Ureli, and Buddhagaya^, on the Neran~
jara-river; the modern Lilanja); the 
place where he, for the first time, 
unveiled the Dhamma to the world (i.e. 
the deer-park at Isipatana near Benares)
; the place where he entered the final 
Nibba^na (i.e. Kusina^ra). (A. IV, 118).

<xa>samyojana</xa>
  'fetters'. There are 10 fetters tying 
beings to the wheel of existence, namely
: (1) personality-belief (sakka^ya-
ditthi, q.v.), (2) sceptical doubt (
vicikiccha^ q.v.), (3) clinging to mere 
rules and ritual (si^labbata-para^ma^sa;
 s. upa^da^na), (4) sensuous craving (ka
^ma-ra^ga, 4.v.), (5) ill-will (vya^pa^
da), (6) craving for fine-material 
existence (rúpa-ra^ga), (7) craving for 
immaterial existence (arúpa-ra^ga), (8) 
conceit (ma^na, q.v.), (9) restlessness 
(uddhacca, q.v.), (10) ignorance (avijja
^, q.v.). The first five of these are 
called 'lower fetters' (orambha^giya-
samyojana), as they tie to the sensuous 
world. The latter 5 are called 'higher 
fetters' (uddhambha^giya-samyojana), as 
they tie to the higher worlds, i.e. the 
fine-material and immaterial world (A. 
IX, 67, 68; X. 13; D . 33, etc.).
<pb n="444"/>
He who is free from 1-3 is a Sota^panna,
 or Stream-winner, i.e. one who has 
entered the stream to Nibba^na, as it 
were. He who, besides these 3 fetters, 
has overcome 4 and 5 in their grosser 
form, is called a Sakada^ga^mi, a 'Once-
returner' (to this sensuous world). He 
who is fully freed from 1-5 is an Ana^ga
^mi^, or 'Non-returner' (to the sensuous
 world). He who is freed from all the 10
 fetters is called an Arahat, i.e. a 
perfectly Holy One.
For more details, s. ariya-puggala.
The 10 fetters as enumerated in the 
Abhidhamma, e.g. Vibh. XVII, are: 
sensuous craving, ill-will, conceit, 
wrong views, sceptical doubt, clinging 
to mere rules and ritual, craving for 
existence, envy, stinginess, ignorance.

<xa>sankappa</xa>
  'thought', is a synonym of vitakka (q.

<xa>sankha^ra</xa>
  This term has, according to its 
context, different shades of meaning, 
which should be carefully distinguished.
(I) To its most frequent usages (s. foll
. 1-4) the general term 'formation' may 
be applied, with the qualifications 
required by the context. This term may 
refer either to the act of 'forming or 
to the passive state of 'having been 
formed' or to both.
1. As the 2nd link of the formula of 
dependent origination, (paticcasamuppa^
da, q.v.), sankha^ra has the active 
aspect, 'forming, and signifies karma (q
<pb n="446"/>
.v.), i.e. wholesome or unwholesome 
volitional activity (cetana^) of body (
ka^ya-s.), speech (vaci^-s.) or mind (
citta- or mano-s.). This definition 
occurs, e.g. at S. XII, 2, 27. For s. in
 this sense, the word 'karma-formation' 
has been coined by the author. In other 
passages, in the same context, s. is 
defined by reference to (a) meritorious 
karma-formations (pun~n~'a^bhisankha^ra)
, (b) demeritorious k. (apun~n~'
abhisankha^ra), (c) imperturbable k. (a^
nen~j'a^bhisankha^ra), e.g. in S. XII, 
51; D. 33. This threefold division 
covers karmic activity in all spheres of
 existence: the meritorious karma-
formations extend to the sensuous and 
the fine-material sphere, the 
demeritorious ones only to the sensuous 
sphere, and the 'imperturbable' only to 
the immaterial sphere.
2. The aforementioned three terms, ka^ya
-, vaci^- and citta-s. are sometimes 
used in quite a different sense, namely 
as (1) bodily function, i.e. in-and-out-
breathing (e.g. M. 10), (2) verbal 
function, i.e. thought-conception and 
discursive thinking, (3) mental-function
, i.e. feeling and perception (e.g. M. 
44). See nirodhasama^patti.
<pb n="447"/>
3. It also denotes the 4th group of 
existence (sankha^rakkhandha), and 
includes all 'mental formations' whether
 they belong to 'karmically forming' 
consciousness or not. See khandha, Tab. 
II. and S. XXII, 56, 79.
4. It occurs further in the sense of 
anything formed (sankhata, q.v.) and 
conditioned, and includes all things 
whatever in the world, all phenomena of 
existence. This meaning applies, e.g. to
 the well-known passage, "All formations
 are impermanent... subject to suffering
" (sabbe sankha^ra anicca^ ... dukkha^).
 In that context, however, s. is 
subordinate to the still wider and all-
embracing term dhamma (thing); for 
dhamma includes also the Unformed or 
Unconditioned Element (asankhata-dha^tu)
, i.e. Nibba^na (e.g. in sabbe dhamma^ 
anatta^, "all things are without a self"
).
(II) Sankha^ra also means sometimes '
volitional effort', e.g. in the formula 
of the roads to power (iddhi-pa^da, q.v.
); in sasankha^ra- and asankha^ra-
parinibba^yi^ (s. ana^ga^mi^, q.v.); and
 in the Abhidhamma terms asankha^rika- (
q.v.) and sasankha^rika-citta, i.e. 
without effort = spontaneously, and with
<pb n="448"/>
 effort = prompted.
In Western literature, in English as 
well as in German, sankha^ra is 
sometimes mistranslated by 'subconscious
 tendencies' or similarly (e.g Prof 
Beckh: "unterbewu?te Bildekr?fte," i.e. 
subconscious formative forces). This 
misinterpretation derives perhaps from a
 similar usage in non-Buddhist Sanskrit 
literature, and is entirely inapplicable
 to the connotations of the term in Pa^
li Buddhism, as listed above under I, 1-
4. For instance, within the dependent 
origination, s. is neither subconscious 
nor a mere tendency, but is a fully 
conscious and active karmic volition. In
 the context of the 5 groups of 
existence (s. above I, 3), a very few of
 the factors from the group of mental 
formations (sankha^rakkhandha) are also 
present as concomitants of 
subconsciousness (s. Tab. I-III), but 
are of course not restricted to it, nor 
are they mere tendencies.

<xa>sankha^rupekkha^ n~a^na</xa>
 the 'equanimity-knowledge with regard 
to the formations of existence', is one 
of those kinds of knowledge which form 
the 'purification by knowledge and 
<pb n="449"/>
vision of the path-progress' (s. 
visuddhi, VI, 8). "It is known by 3 
names: in the lowest stage it is called 
'knowledge consisting in the desire for 
deliverance' (rnuccitu-kamyata^-n~a^na);
 in the middle stage it is called the '
reflecting contemplation' (patisankha^
nupassana^n~a^na); in the last stage, 
however, i.e. after attaining the summit
, it is called the 'equanimity-knowledge
 with regard to the formations of 
existence' " (Vis.M. XXI).

<xa>sankhata</xa>
  the 'formed', i.e. anything originated
 or conditioned, comprises all phenomena
 of existence. Cf. sankha^ra I, 4; 
asankhata.

<xa>sankhitta citta</xa>
 in the Satipattha^na Sutta, signifies 
the 'contracted' or 'cramped' mind, not 
the concentrated (sama^hita) mind, as 
often translated by Western authors. Cf.
 Satipattha^na (3).

<xa>san~n~a^</xa>
  1. 'perception', is one of the 5 
groups of existence (khandha, q.v.), and
 one of the 7 mental factors (cetasika) 
<pb n="450"/>
that are inseparably bound up with all 
consciousness (s. cetana^). It is 
sixfold as perception of the 5 physical 
sense-objects and of mental objects. It 
is the awareness of an object's 
distinctive marks ("one perceives blue, 
yellow, etc.," S. XXII, 79). If, in 
repeated perception of an object, these 
marks are recognized, san~n~a^ functions
 as 'memory' (s. Abh. St., p. 68f.).
2. san~n~a^ stands sometimes for 
consciousness in its entirety, e.g. in n
'eva-san~n~a^-n'a^san~n~a^yatana, 'the 
realm of neither-perception-nor- non-
perception'; further, in asan~n~a^-satta
, 'unconscious beings'. In both cases 
reference is not to 'perception' alone, 
but also to all other constituents of 
consciousness. Cf. D. 9.
3. san~n~a^ may also refer to the 'ideas
', which are objects of meditation, e.g.
 in a group of 7 ideas, of impermanence 
(anicca-s. ), etc. (A. VII, 46); of 10: 
impurity (asubha-s.), etc. (A. X, 56), 
and another set of 10 in A. X. 60; or to
 wrong notions, as in nicca-, subha-s. (
the notion of permanence, beauty), etc.

Blessed One (itivuttaka), birth stories 
(ja^taka), extraordinary things (
abbhutadhamma), and analysis (vedalla). 
This classification is often found in 
the suttas (e.g. M. 22). According to 
the commentaries, also the Vinaya and 
the Abhidhamma Pitaka are comprised in 
that ninefold division (see Atthasa^lini
 Tr., I, 33). It is a classification 
according to literary styles, and not

according to given texts or books.

the 8-fold Path (magga, q.v.), and is, 
in its widest sense, one of those mental

<xa>satipattha^na</xa>
  the 4 'foundations of mindfulness', 
lit. 'awarenesses of mindfulness' (sati-
upattha^na), are: contemplation of body,
 feeling, mind and mind-objects. - For 
sati, s. prec.
A detailed treatment of this subject, so
 important for the practice of Buddhist 
mental culture, is given in the 2 
Satipattha^na Suttas (D. 22; M. 10), 
which at the start as well as the 
conclusion, proclaim the weighty words: 
"The only way that leads to the 
attainment of purity, to the overcoming 
of sorrow and lamentation, to the end of
 pain and grief, to the entering of the 
right path, and to the realization of 
Nibba^na is the 4 foundations of 
mindfulness."
<pb n="455"/>
After these introductory words, and upon
 the question which these 4 are, it is 
said that the monk dwells in 
contemplation of the body, the feelings,
 the mind, and the mind-objects, "ardent
, clearly conscious and mindful, after 
putting away worldly greed and grief."
These 4 contemplations are in reality 
not to be taken as merely separate 
exercises, but on the contrary, at least
 in many cases, especially in the 
absorptions, as things inseparably 
associated with each other. Thereby the 
Satipatha^na Sutta forms an illustration
 of the way in which these 4 
contemplations relating to the 5 groups 
of existence (khandha, q.v.) 
simultaneously come to be realized, and 
finally lead to insight into the 
impersonality of all existence.
(1) The contemplation of the body (ka^
yanupassana^) consists of the following 
exercises: mindfulness with regard to in
-and-outbreathing (a^na^pa^nasati, q.v.)
, minding the 4 postures (iriya^patha, q
.v.), mindfulness and clarity of 
consciousness (satisampajan~n~a, q.v.), 
reflection on the 32 parts of the body (
s. ka^yagata^sati and asubha), analysis 
of the 4 physical elements (dha^
<pb n="456"/>
tuvavattha^na, q.v.), cemetery 
meditations (si^vathika^ q.v.).
(2) All feelings (vedana^nupassana^) 
that arise in the meditator he clearly 
perceives, namely: agreeable and 
disagreeable feeling of body and mind, 
sensual and super-sensual feeling, 
indifferent feeling .
(3) He further clearly perceives and 
understands any state of consciousness 
or mind (citta^nupassana^), whether it 
is greedy or not, hateful or not, 
deluded or not, cramped or distracted, 
developed or undeveloped, surpassable or
 unsurpassable, concentrated or 
unconcentrated, liberated or unliberated
.
(4) Concerning the mind-objects (dhamma^
nupassana^), he knows whether one of the
 five hindrances (ni^varana, q.v.) is 
present in him or not, knows how it 
arises, how it is overcome, and how in 
future it does no more arise. He knows 
the nature of each of the five groups (
khandha, q.v.), how they arise, and how 
they are dissolved. He knows the 12 
bases of all mental activity (a^yatana q
.v.): the eye and the visual object, the
 ear and the audible object, .. mind and
 mind-object, he knows the fetters (
<pb n="457"/>
samyojana, q.v.) based on them, knows 
how they arise, how they are overcome, 
and how in future they do no more arise.
 He knows whether one of the seven 
factors of enlightenment (bojjhanga, q.v
.) is present in him or not, knows how 
it arises, and how it comes to full 
development. Each of the Four Noble 
Truths (sacca, q.v.) he understands 
according to reality.
The 4 contemplations comprise several 
exercises, but the Satipattha^na should 
not therefore be thought of as a mere 
collection of meditation subjects, any 
one of which may be taken out and 
practised alone. Though most of the 
exercises appear also elsewhere in the 
Buddhist scriptures, in the context of 
this sutta they are chiefly intended for
 the cultivation of mindfulness and 
insight, as indicated by the repetitive 
passage concluding each section of the 
sutta (see below). The 4 contemplations 
cover all the 5 groups of existence (
khandha, q.v.), because mindfulness is 
meant to encompass the whole personality
. Hence, for the full development of 
mindfulness, the practice should extend 
to all 4 types of contemplation, though 
not every single exercise mentioned 
<pb n="458"/>
under these four headings need be taken 
up. A methodical practice of Satipattha^
na has to start with one of the 
exercises out of the group '
contemplation of the body', which will 
serve as the primary and regular subject
 of meditation: The other exercises of 
the group and the other contemplatons 
are to be cultivated when occasion for 
them arises during meditation and in 
everyday life.
After cach contemplation it is shown how
 it finally leads to insight-knowledge: 
"Thus with regard to his own body he 
contemplates the body, with regard to 
the bodies of others he contemplates the
 body, with regard to both he 
contemplates the body. He beholds how 
the body arises and how it passes away, 
beholds the arising and passing away of 
the body. 'A body is there' (but no 
living being, no individual, no woman, 
no man, no self, nothing that belongs to
 a self; neither a person, nor anything 
belonging to a person; Com.): thus he 
has established his attentiveness as far
 as it serves his knowledge and 
mindfulness, and he lives independent, 
unattached to anything in the world.''
In the same way he contemplates feeling,
<pb n="459"/>
 mind and mind-objects.
In M. 118 it is shown how these four 
foundations of mindfulness may be 
brought about by the exercise of 
mindfulness on in-and-out breathing (a^
na^pa^na-sati, q.v.).

such as the human beings, some heavenly 
beings, and some beings living in the 
world of suffering (vinipa^tika, q.v.).

as the first-born gods of the Brahma-

s. deva II).
(5) "There are beings without perception
 and feeling, such as the unconscious 
beings (asan~n~a-satta, q.v.).
(6) "There are beings who, through the 
complete overcoming of perceptions of 
matter (rúpa-san~n~a), the disappearance
 of perceptions of sense-reaction (
patigha-san~n~a), and the non-attention 
to perceptions of variety thinking: '
Boundless is space', are reborn in the 
sphere of buundless space (s. deva, III;
 jha^na, 5).
(7) "There are beings who, through the 
complete overcoming of the sphere of 
boundless space, thinking: 'Boundless is

monks, does the dwelling place possess 5
 advantages? Such a dwelling place is 
not too far, nor too near (to the 
village), is suitable for going (on 
almsround) and returning. In the daytime
 it is not much crowded, and at night 
without noise and bustle. One is not 
much molested there by gadflies, 
mosquitoes, wind, sun and creeping 
things. While living there, the monk 
without difficulty obtains robes, 
almsfood, dwelling, and the necessary 
medicines. There are elder monks living 
there, with great learning, well versed 
in the Message, masters of the Law (

<xa>sikkha^</xa>
  the 'training', which the Buddha's 
disciple has to undergo, is 3-fold: 
training in higher morality (adhisi^la-
sikkha^), in higher mentality (adhicitta
-sikkha^), and in higher wisdom (adhipan
~n~a^-sikkha^). This 3-fold training 
refers to the 3-fold division of the the
 8-fold Path (magga, q.v.) in morality, 
concentration and wisdom (si^la, sama^
<pb n="467"/>
dhi, pan~n~a^). In D. 16 and A.IV,1 it 
is said:
"It is through not understanding, not 
penetrating noble morality ... noble 
concentration ... noble wisdom ... noble
 deliverance that I, as well as you, 
have had for such a long time to pass 
through this round of rebirths.''
"This then is morality, this 
concentration, this wisdom, this 
deliverance. Being endowed with morality
, concentration brings high fruit and 
blessing. Being endowed with 
concentration, wisdom hrings high fruit 
and blessing. Being endowed with wisdom,
 the mind becomes freed from all cankers
 (a^sava q.v.) namely, from the sensuous
 canker (ka^ma^sava), from the canker of
 existence (bhavasava) from the canker 
of opinions (ditthisava) from the canker
 of ignorance (avijja^sava).

<xa>sikkha^pada</xa>
  'steps of training', moral rules.
The 5 moral rules, also called pan~ca-si
^la which are binding on all Buddhist 
laymen, are: (1) abstaining from killing
 any living being, (2) from stealing, (3
) from unlawful sexual intercourse, (4) 
from lying, (5) from the use of 
<pb n="468"/>
intoxicants.(s. sura^meraya etc.)
The 10 rules (dasa-si^la) are binding on
 all novices and monks, namely: (1) 
abstaining from killing, (2) from 
stealing, (3) from unchastity, (4) from 
lying, (5) from the use of intoxicants, 
(6) from eating after midday, (7) from 
dancing, singing, music and shows, (8) 
from garlands, scents, cosmetics and 
adornments, etc., (9) from luxurious 
beds, (10) from accepting gold and 
silver.
In the 8 rules (attha-si^la) which on 
full and new moon days, and on the first
 and last quarter of the moon, are 
observed by many lay-followers (upa^saka
, q.v.), the 7th and 8th of the above 10
 rules are fused into one as the 7th 
rule, while the 9th becomes the 8th.

<xa>si^la</xa>
  'morality', 'virtue', is a mode of 
mind and volition (cetana, q.v.) 
manifested in speech or bodily action (s
. karma). It is the foundation of the 
whole Buddhist practice, and therewith 
the first of the 3 kinds of training (
sikkha^, q.v.) that form the 3-fold 
division of the 8-fold Path (s. magga), 
i.e. morality, concentration and wisdom.
<pb n="469"/>
Buddhist morality is not, as it may 
appear from the negative formulations in
 the Sutta-texts, something negative. 
And it does not consist in the mere not 
committing of evil actions, but is in 
each instance the clearly conscious and 
intentional restraint from the bad 
actions in question and corresponds to 
the simultaneously arising volition.
Morality of the 8-fold Path, namely, 
right speech, right action and right 
livelihood, is called 'genuine or 
natural morality' pakatisi^la), as 
distinguished from the external rules 
for monks or laymen, the so-called '
prescribed morality' (pan~n~atti-si^la, 
q.v.), which, as such, is karmically 
neutral.
"What now is karmically wholesome 
morality (kusala-si^la)? It is the 
wholesome bodily action (ka^ya-kamma, s.
 karma), wholesome verbal action (vaci^-
kamma, s. karma), and also the purity 
with regard to livelihood which I call 
morality" (M. 78). Cf. magga, 3-5.
For the 5, 8 and 10 rules, s. sikkha^
pada. Further cf. ca^ritta- and va^ritta
-si^la.
The 4 kinds of morality consisting of 
purification (catupa^risuddhi-si^la) are
<pb n="470"/>
: (1) restraint with regard to the monks
' Disciplinary Code, (2) restraint of 
the senses, (3) purification of 
livelihood, (4) morality with regard to 
the 4 requisites (of the monk) .
(1) Restraint with regard to the 
Disciplinary Code (pa^timokkha-samvara-
si^la). "Here the monk is restrained in 
accordance with the monks' Disciplinary 
Code, is perfect in conduct and 
behaviour, and perceiving danger even in
 the least offences, he trains himself 
in the rules he has taken upon him" (A .
 V, 87,109 ,114, etc. ) .
(2) Restraint of the senses (indriya-
samvara-si^la). "Whenever the monk 
perceives a form with the eye, a sound 
with the ear, an odour with the nose, a 
taste with the tongue, an impression 
with the body, an object with the mind, 
he neither adheres to the appearance as 
a whole, nor to its parts. And he 
strives to ward off that through which 
evil and unwholesome things, greed and 
sorrow, would arise, if he remained with
 unguarded senses; and he watches over 
his senses, restrains his senses" (M 38)
.
(3) Purification of livelihood (a^ji^va-
pa^risuddhi-si^la). It consists therein 
<pb n="471"/>
that the monk does not acquire his 
livelihood in a way unbefitting to a 
monk.
(4) Morality with regard to the 4 
rcquisites (paccaya-sannissita-si^la). 
It consists therein that the monk is 
guided by the right mental attitude when
 making use of the 4 requisites: robes, 
almsfood, dwelling and medicine. "Wisely
 reflecting he makes use of his robes ..
. merely to protect himself against cold
 and heat, etc. Wisely reflecting he 
makes use of his almsfood... merely as a
 prop and support to this body.... 
Wisely reflecting he makes use of his 
dwelling... merely to keep off the 
dangers of weather and to enjoy solitude
.... Wisely rerlecting he makes use of 
the necessary medicines, merely to 
suppress feelings of sickness that arise
, and to reach perfect freedom from 
suffering" (cf. M. 2).
About these 4 kinds of morality, Vis.M. 
I gives a detailed exposition.

<xa>si^labbata</xa>
 para^ma^sa and -upa^da^na: 'attachment 
(or clinging) to mere rules and ritual',
 is the 3rd of the 10 fetters (samyojana

<pb n="472"/>
clinging (upa^da^na, q.v.). It

  'cemetery contemplations', as 
deseribed in D. 22 and M. 10, have as 
their objects a corpse one or two or 
three days old, swollen up, blue-black 
in colour, full of corruption; a corpse 
eaten by crows, etc.; a framework of 
bones; flesh hanging from it, 
bespattered with blood, held together by
 the sinews; without flesh and blood, 
but still held together by the sinews; 
bones scattered in all direction; 
bleached and resembling shells; heaped 
together after the lapse of years; 
weathered and crumbled to dust. At the 
end of each of these contemplations 
<pb n="473"/>
there follows the conclusion: "This body
 of mine also has this nature, has this 
destiny, cannot escape it." Similar are

<pb n="474"/>

consciousness (greedy c. ib. 22-25), and
 with karmically neutral consciousness (

  the 'Stream-winner', is the lowest of 
the 8 noble disciples (s. ariya-puggala)
. Three kinds are to be distinguished: 
the one 'with 7 rebirths at the utmost' 
(sattakkhattu-parama), the one 'passing 
from one noble family to another' (
kolankola), the one 'germinating only 
once more' (eka-bi^ji^). As it is said (
e.g. Pug. 37-39; A. III, 87):
(1) "If a man, after the disappearance 
of the 3 fetters (personality-belief, 
skeptical doubt, attachment to rules and
 ritual; s. samyojana), has entered the 
stream (to Nibba^na), he is no more 
<pb n="475"/>
subject to rebirth in lower worlds, is 
firmly established, destined to full 
enlightenment. After having passed 
amongst the heavenly and human beings 
only seven times more through the round 
of rebirths, he puts an end to suffering
. Such a man is called 'one with 7 
births at the utmost' (sattakkhattu-
parama).
(2) "If a man, after the disappearance 
of the 3 fetters.... is destined to full
 enlightenment, he, after having passed 
among noble families two or three times 
through the round of rebirths, puts an 
end to suffering. Such a man is called '
one passing from one noble family to 
another' (kolankola).
(3) "If a man, after the disappearance 
of the 3 fetters.... is destined to full
 enlightenment, he, after having only 
once more returned to human existence, 
puts an end to suffering. Such a man is 
called 'one germinating only once more' 
(eka-bi^ji^). See Sota^patti-Samyutta (S

<xa>sugati</xa>
  'happy course of existence'; s. gati.

<xa>sukha</xa>
  pleasant, happy; happiness, pleasure, 
joy, bliss. It is one of the three 
feelings (s. vedana^) and may be either 
bodily or mental. The texts distinguish 
between the happiness of the senses and 
the h. of renunciation (A. II), worldly 
(carnal; sa^misa) and unworldly (non-
carnal; nira^misa) happiness (M. 10). 
See A. II, ch. VIII. - Happiness is an 
indispensable condition for attaining 
concentration of mind (sama^dhi, q.v.), 
and therefore it is one of the 5 factors
 (or constituents) of the 1st absorption
 (jha^nanga; s. jha^na) and is present 
up to the 3rd absorption inclusively. "
<pb n="481"/>
The mind of the happy one has 
concentration as its fruit and reward" (
A.X,1). - "In him who is filled with 
happiness, right concentration has found
 a foundation" (A.X,3).

<xa>sukha san~n~a^,  citta,  ditthi</xa>
 'the perception (consciousness or view)
 of happiness' in what is actually 
suffering (dukkhe sukha-san~n~a^), i.e. 
any form of existence, it is one of the 
perversions (vipalla^sa, q.v.).

<xa>sukkha vipassaka</xa>
 'one supported by bare insight', is the
 commentarial term for one who, without 
having attained any of the meditative 
absorptions (jha^na, q.v.), has realized
 only by the support of insight (
vipassana^, q.v.) one or several of the 
supermundane paths (s. ariyapuggala). In
 Vis.M. XVIII, he is called suddha-
vipassana^-ya^nika, as distinguished 
from 'one who has tranquillity as 
vehicle' (samathaya^nika, q.v.). Though 
the primary meaning of sukkha as 
intended here is as stated above, 
subcommentaries (e.g. D. Ti^ka^) employ 
also the literal meaning of sukkha, i.e.
 'dry': "His insight is dry, rough, 
<pb n="482"/>
unmoistened by the moisture of 
tranquillity meditation." This justifies
 a frequent rendering of this term by '
dry-visioned' or 'having dry insight', 
which, however, should not lead to 
misconceptions about the nature of 
insight meditation as being 'dry' or '
merely intellectual', while in fact the 
development of insight will produce 
rapture (pi^ti) and a sense of urgency (
samvega) in the meditator. - (App.).

<xa>sun~n~a</xa>
 (adj.), sun~n~ata^ (noun): void (ness),
 empty (emptiness). As a doctrinal term 
it refers, in Therava^da, exclusively to
 the anatta^ doctrine,.i.e. the 
unsubstantiality of all phenomena: "Void
 is the world ... because it is void of 
a self and anything belonging to a self"
 (sun~n~am attena va^ attaniyena va^; S.
 XXXV, 85); also stated of the 5 groups 
of existence (khandha, q.v.) in the same
 text. See also M. 43, M. 106. - In 
CNidd. (quoted in Vis.M. XXI, 55), it is
 said: "Eye ... mind, visual objects ...
 mind-objects, visual consciousness ... 
mind-consciousness, corporeality ... 
consciousness, etc., are void of self 
and anything belonging to a self; void 
<pb n="483"/>
of permanency and of anything lasting, 
eternal or immutable.. They are coreless
: without a core of permanency, or core 
of happiness or core of self." - In M. 
121, the voiding of the mind of the 
cankers, in the attainment of Arahatship
, is regarded as the "fully purified and
 incomparably highest (concept of) 
voidness. - See Sn. v. 1119; M. 121; M. 
122 (WHEEL 87); Pts.M. II: Sun~n~a-katha

 "I take upon myself the vow to abstain

 moral carelessness." This is the 
wording of the last of the 5 moral rules
 (s. sikkha^pada) binding on all

<pb n="485"/>
 'ovcrcoming by the opposite', is one of
 the 5 kinds of overcoming (paha^na, q.v

<xa>tada^rammana citta</xa>
 'registering consciousness' (s. Tab. I,
 40-49, 56), is the last stage in the 
complete process of cognition (citta-vi^
thi) immediately before sinking into the
 subconscious. It does not occur with 
the consciousness of the absorptions nor
 with supermundane consciousness, but 
only with large or distinct objects of 
the sensuous sphere. Cf. vin~n~a^na-

  a^sava (q.v.).

<xa>talk</xa>

<xa>tanha^</xa>
  (lit. 'thirst'): 'craving', is the 
chief root of suffering, and of the ever
-continuing cycle of rebirths. "What, o 
monks, is the origin of suffering? It is
 that craving which gives rise to ever-
fresh rebirth and, bound up with 
pleasure and lust, now here, now there, 
<pb n="486"/>
finds ever fresh delight. It is the 
sensual craving (ka^ma-tanha^), the 
craving for existence (bhava-tanha^), 
the craving for non-existence (vibhava-
tanha^)'' (D. 22). T. is the 8th link in
 the formula of the dependent 
origination (paticcasamuppa^da, q.v.). 
Cf. sacca.
Corresponding to the 6 sense-objects, 
there are 6 kinds of craving craving for
 visible objects, for sounds, odours, 
tastes, bodily impressions, mental 
impressions (rúpa-, sadda-, gandha-, 
rasa-, photthabba-, dhamma-tanha^). (M. 
9; D. 15)
Corresponding to the 3-fold existence, 
there are 3 kinds: craving for sensual 
existence (ka^ma-tanha^), for fine-
material existence (rúpa-tanha^), for 
immaterial existence (arúpa-tanha^). (D.
 33)
There are 18 'thought-channels of 
craving' (tanha^-vicarita) induced 
internally, and 18 induced externally; 
and as occurring in past, present and 
future, they total 108; see A. IV, 199; 
Vibh., Ch. 17 (Khuddakavatthu-Vibhanga).
According to the dependent origination, 
craving is conditioned by feeling; on 
this see D. 22 (section on the 2nd Truth
<pb n="487"/>
).
Of craving for existence (bhava-tanha^ )
 it is said (A. X, 62): "No first 
beginning of the craving for existence 
can be perceived, o monks, before which 
it was not and after which it came to be
. But it can he perceived that craving 
for existence has its specific condition
. I say, o monks, that also craving for 
existence has its condition that feeds 
it (sa^haram) and is not without it. And
 what is it? 'Ignorance', one has to 
reply." - Craving for existence and 
ignorance are called "the outstanding 
causes that lead to happy and unhappy 
destinies (courses of existence)" (s. 
Vis.M. XVII, 36-42).
The most frequent synonyms of tanha^ are
 ra^ga (q.v.) and lobha (s. múla).

<xa>tanha^ kkhaya</xa>
 'extinction of craving', is identical 
with 'extinction of cankers' (a^
savakkhaya) and the attainment of 
perfect Holiness or Arahatship. Cf. 
ariya-puggala.

<xa>tanha^ nissita si^la</xa>
 'morality based on craving' (s. nissaya
).
<pb n="488"/>

<xa>tatha^gata</xa>
  the 'Perfect One', lit. the one who 
has 'thus gone', or 'thus come', is an 
epithet of the Buddha used by him when 
speaking of himself.
To the often asked questions, whether 
the Tatha^gata still exists after death,
 or not, it is said (e.g. S. XXII, 85, 
86) that, in the highest sense (
paramattha, q.v.) the Tatha^gata cannot,
 even at lifetime, be discovered, how 
much less after death, and that neither 
the 5 groups of existence (khandha, q.v.
) are to be regarded as the Tatha^gata, 
nor can the Tatha^gata be found outside 
these corporeal and mental phenomena. 
The meaning intended here is that there 
exist only these ever-changing corporeal
 and mental phenomena, arising and 
vanishing from moment to moment, but no 
separate entity, no personality.
When the commentaries in this connection
 explain Tatha^gata by 'living being' (
satta), they mean to say that here the 
questioners are using the merely 
conventional expression, Tatha^gata, in 
the sense of a really existing entity.
Cf. anatta^, paramattha, puggala, ji^va,
 satta.

of the Word 'Tatha^gata' " is included

known by the name upekkha^. In its 
widest sense it is associated with all 
pure consciousness (s. Tab. II). "Tatra-
majjhattata^ is called the 'keeping in

<xa>therava^da</xa>
  'Doctrine of the Elders', is a name of
 the oldest form of the Buddha's 
teachings, handed down to us in the Pa^
li language. According to tradition, its
 name is derived from the fact of having
 been fixed by 500 holy Elders of the 
Order, soon after the death of the 
Master.
Therava^da is the only one of the old 
schools of Buddhism that has survived 
<pb n="492"/>

 q.v.).
"Whether Perfect Ones appear in the 
world, or whether Perfect Ones do not 
appear in the world, it still remains a 
firm condition, an immutable fact and 
fixed law: that all formations are 
impermanent, that all formations are 
subject to suffering, that everything is
 without a self'' (A. III, 134).
"What do you think, o monks: Is 
corporeality (rúpa) permanent or 
impermanent? - Impermanent, o Venerable 
One. - Are feeling (vedana^), perception
 (san~n~a^), mental formations (sankha^
ra) and consciousness (vin~n~a^na), 
permanent or impermanent? - Impermanent,
 o Venerable One.
"But that which is impermanent, is it 
something pleasant or painful? - It is 
<pb n="494"/>
painful, o Venerable One.
"But, of what is impermanent, painful 
and subject to change, could it be 
rightly said, 'This belongs to me, this 
am I, this is my ego'? - No, Venerable 
One.
"'I'herefore, whatever there is of 
corporeality, feeling, perception, 
mental formations and consciousness, 
whether past, present or future, one's 
own or external, gross or subtle, lofty 
or low, far or near, of all these things
 one should understand, according to 
reality and true wisdom: 'This does not 
belong to me, this am I not, this is not
 my ego' " (S. XXII, 59).
"In one who understands eye, ear, nose, 
tongue, body and all the remaining 
formations as impermanent, painful and 
not-self, in him the fetters (samyojana,
 q.v.) are dissolved" (S. XXXV, 53).

<xa>tittha^yatana</xa>
  the 3 'articles of (heretical) belief'
. which in A. III, 61 are declared as 
leading to inactivity, are: (1) the 
belief that all happiness and woe are 
produced through former karma (prenatal 
actions; s. karma); (2) that everything 
is uncaused; (3) that everything is 
created by God.
(1) is the teaching of Niggantha-Na^
thaputta, the leader of the Nigganthas, 
the modern Jains. The fault with this 
doctrine is that it does not account for
 that happiness and woe which either are
 the result of the present life's good 
or bad action, or are associated with 
the corresponding action. (2) is the 
doctrine of Makkhali Gosa^la; s. ditthi.
According to the above 3 doctrines, man 
is not responsible for his actions, so 
that all moral exertions become useless.

<xa>ubhato bha^ga vimutta</xa>
 the 'both-ways-liberated one', is the 
name of one class of noble disciples (
ariya-puggala, q.v.). He is liberated in
 2 ways, namely, by way of all 8 
absorptions (jha^na, q.v.) as well as by
 the supermundane path (sota^patti, etc.
) based on insight (vipassana^, q.v.). 
In M. 70 it is said:
''Who, o monks, is a both-ways-liberated
 one'? If someone in his own person has 
reached the 8 liberations (absorptions),
 and through wise penetration the 
cankers (a^sava, q.v.) have become 
extinguished, such a one is called a 
both-ways-liberated one.'' Cf. D. 15.
In the widest sense, one is both-ways-
<pb n="501"/>
liberated if one has reached one or the 
other of the absorptions, and one or the
 other of the supermundane paths (cf. A.
 IX, 44).
The first liberation is also called '
liberation of mind' (cetovimutti), the 
latter liberation through wisdom' (pan~n
~a^-vimutti).
The first liberation, however, is merely
 temporary, being a liberation through 
repression (vikkhambhana-vimutti = 
vikkhambhana-paha^na: s. paha^na).

<xa>upa^da^na</xa>
  'clinging', according to Vis.M. XVII, 
is an intensified degree of craving (
tanha^, q.v.). The 4 kinds of clinging 
are: sensuous clinging (ka^mupa^da^na), 
clinging to views (ditthupa^da^na), 
clinging to mere rules and ritual (si^
labbatupa^da^na), clinging to the 
personaljty-belief (atta-va^dupa^da^na).
(1) "What now is the sensuous clinging? 
<pb n="505"/>
Whatever with regard to sensuous objects
 there exists of sensuous lust, sensuous
 desire, sensuous attachment, sensuous 
passion, sensuous deludedness, sensuous 
fetters: this is called sensuous 
clinging.
(2) ''What is the clinging to views? '
Alms and offerings are useless; there is
 no fruit and result for good and bad 
deeds: all such view and wrong 
conceptions are called the clinging to 
views.
(3) "What is the clinging to mere rules 
and ritual? The holding firmly to the 
view that through mere rules and ritual 
one may reach purification: this is 
called the clinging to mere rules and 
ritual.
(4) "What is the clinging to the 
personality-belief? The 20 kinds of ego-
views with regard to the groups of 
existence (s. sakka^ya-ditthi): these 
are called the clinging to the 
personality-belief" (Dhs. 1214-17).
This traditional fourfold division of 
clinging is not quite satisfactory. 
Besides kamupa^da^na we should expect 
either rúpupa^da^na and arúpupa^da^na, 
or simply bhavupa^da^na. Though the Ana^
ga^mi^ is entirely free from the 
<pb n="506"/>
traditional 4 kinds of upa^da^na, he is 
not freed from rebirth, as he still 
possesses bhavupa^da^na. The Com. to Vis
.M. XVII, in trying to get out of this 
dilemma, explains ka^mupa^da^na as 
including here all the remaining kinds 
of clinging.
"Clinging' is the common rendering for u
., though 'grasping' would come closer 
to the literal meaning of it, which is '
uptake'; s. Three Cardinal Discourses (
WHEEL 17), p.19.

<xa>upa^da^na kkhandha</xa>
 the 5 'groups of clinging', or more 
clearly stated in accordance with Vis.M.
, 'the 5 groups of existence which form 
the objects of clinging'. Cf. M. 44, and
 see khandha.

<xa>upa^da^ rúpa</xa>
 'derived corporeality', signifies the 
24 secondary corporeal phenomena 
dependent on the 4 primary physical 
elements, i.e. the sense-organs and 
sense-objects, etc. See khandha I; App.

<xa>upadhi</xa>
  'substratum of existence'. In the Com.
 there are enumerated 4 kinds: the 5 
<pb n="507"/>
groups (khandha, q.v.), sensuous desire 
(ka^ma), mental defilements (kilesa, q.v
.), karma (q.v.). In the suttas it 
occurs frequently in Sn. (vv. 33, 364, 
546, 728), and, with reference to Nibba^
na, in the phrase "the abandoning of all
 substrata" (sabbúpadhi-patinissagga; D.
 14). See viveka (3).

<xa>upa^di</xa>
  lit. 'something which one grasps, to 
which one clings, i.e. the 5 groups of 
existence (khandha, q.v.). In the suttas
, the word is mostly used in such 
expressions as "One of the 2 fruits may 
be expected: either perfect wisdom or, 
if the groups are still remaining (sati 
upa^di-sese, 'if there is a remainder of
 groups ), Ana^ga^mi^ship" (D. 22). 
Further (A. IV. 118): "Here the Perfect 
One has passed into the Nibba^na-element
 in which no more groups are remaining (
anupa^di-sesa)." Cf. nibba^na. upa^dinna
 rúpa: 'karmically acquired corporeality
', or 'matter clung-to (by karma)', is 
identical with karma-produced 
corporeality (kammaja-rúpa; s. samuttha^
na). In Vis.M. XIV it is said: "That 
corporcality which, later on, we shall 
refer to as 'karma-produced' (kammaja), 
<pb n="508"/>
is, for its being dependent on previous 
(pre-natal) karma, called 'karmically 
acquired'. '' The term (upa^dinna) 
occurs so in the suttas, e.g. M. 28 (
WHEEL 101), 62, 140. See Dhs. §990; 
Khandha Vibh.

<xa>upagha^taka kamma</xa>
 'destructive karma'; s. karma.

<xa>upahacca parinibba^yi^</xa>
 'one who reaches Nibba^na within the 
first half of life', is one of the 5 
kinds of Ana^ga^mi^ (q.v.).

<xa>upakkilesa</xa>
  'impurities', corruptions, 
imperfections (a frequent rendering by '
defilements' is better reserved for 
kilesa, q.v.).
A list of 16 moral 'impurities of the 
mind' (cittassa upakkilesa) is mentioned
 and explained in M. 7 ＆ 8 (WHEEI. 61/62
): 1. covetousness and unrighteous greed
 (abhijjha^-visamalobha), 2. ill will (
vya^pa^da), 3. anger (kodha), 4. 
hostility (upana^ha), 5. denigration (
makkha), 6. domineering (pala^sa), 7. 
envy (issa^), 8. stinginess (macchariya)
, 9. hypocrisy (ma^ya^), 10. fraud (sa^

presumption (sa^rambha), 13. conceit (ma
^na), 14. arrogance (atima^na), 15. 
vanity (mada), 16. negligence (pama^da).
There are 3 groups of upakkilesa 
pertaining to meditation:
(a) 9 mental imperfections occurring in 
'one devoted to higher mental training' 
(adhicitta); 3 coarse ones - evil 
conduct in deeds, words and thoughts; 3 
medium - thoughts of sensual desire, ill
 will and cruelty; 3 subtle - thoughts 
about one's relatives, one's country and
 one's reputation (A. III, 100).
(b) 18 imperfections in the practice of 
mindfulness of breathing (a^na^pa^na-
sati, q.v.), mentioned in Pts.M., a^na^
pa^na-katha^ (tr. in Mindfulness of 
Breathing, by n~a^namoli Thera (p. 60;

<xa>upa^saka</xa>
  lit. 'sitting close by', i.e. a 'lay 
adherent', is any lay follower who is 
filled with faith and has taken refuge 
in the Buddha, his doctrine and his 
community of noble disciples (A. VIII, 
25). His virtue is regarded as pure if 
he observes the 5 Precepts (pan~ca-si^la
; s. sikkha^pada). He should avoid the 
following wrong ways of livelihood: 
trading in arms, in living beings, meat,
 alcohol and poison (A. V, 177). See 
also A. VIII, 75.

<xa>upasama^nussati</xa>

is considered detachment (vira^ga), i.e.
 the crushing of conceit, the stilling

be confounded with indifferent feeling (
adukkha-m-asukha^ vedana^) which 
sometimes also is called upekkha^ (s. 
vedana^).
upekkha^ is one of the 4 sublime abodes 
(brahma-viha^ra, q.v.), and of the

 'morality consisting in avoiding' (evil

<xa>vasi^</xa>
  'mastery'. Vis.M. IV speaks of 5 kinds
 of m., which anyone who wishes to 
develop the absorptions (jha^na, q.v.) 
should acquire first of all, with regard
 to the 1st absorption, namely: mastery 
in adverting to it (a^vajjana-vasi^), in
 entering it (sama^pajjana-vasi^), in 
determining it (adhittha^na-vasi^), in 
rising therefrom (vuttha^na-vasi^), in 
retrospection (paccavekkhana-vasi^). - (
App.).
"If wherever, whenever, and for whatever
 duration desired, one enters the 1st 
absorption, and at one's entering it, no
 slowness is experienced, this is called
 mastery in entering the absorption, etc
. In an analogous way, the 4 remaining 
kinds are to be explained" (Vis.M. IV, 
131f; XXIII, 27ff.).

<xa>vatta</xa>
  1. 'round', 2. 'round of rebirths'.
<pb n="516"/>
(1) With reference to the dependent 
origination (paticcasamuppa^da, q.v.), 
Vis.M. XVII speaks of 3 rounds: the 
karma round (kamma-vatta) comprising the
 karma-formations and the karmaprocess (
2nd and 10th links); the round of 
defilements (kilesa-vatta) comprising 
ignorance, craving and clinging (1st, 
8th and 9th links); the round of results
 (vipa^ka-vatta) comprising 
consciousness, mind and corporeality, 6 
bases, impression, feeling (3rd-7th 
links). Cf. paticcasamuppa^da (diagram).
(2) round of rebirth = samsa^ra (q.v.).

<xa>vatthu</xa>
  'physical base', i.e. the 6 physical 
organs on which the mental process is 
based, are the 5 physical sense-organs 
and, according to the Com., the heart (
hadaya-vatthu, q.v.) as the 6th. This 
6th vatthu must not be confounded with 
the 6th a^yatana, which is a collective 
name for all consciousness whatever. - (
App.).

<xa>vatthu ka^ma</xa>
 'objective sensuality', the 5 sense-
objects; s. ka^ma.

<pb n="517"/>
<xa>vavattha^na</xa>
  'determining', defining. In its 
application to insight meditation, this 
term occurred first in Pts.M. (I, p. 53)
; but in a verbal form, as a past 
participle, already in M. 111: tyassa 
dhamma^ anupada-vavatthita^ honti, "
these things (the mental factors) were 
determined by him (i.e. Sa^riputta) 
successively" (s. Abh. St., p. 54). In 
Vis.M. XX, 130, it is said: 'The 
determining of the truth of suffering is
 effected with the determining of mind-
and-body in the purification of view (s.
 visuddhi III). The determining of the 
truth of origination is effected with 
the discerning of conditions in the 
purification by transcending doubt (s. 
visuddhi IV). The determining of the 
truth of the path is effected by 
emphasis on the right path in the 
purification by knowledge and vision of 
what is path and not-path (s. visuddhi V
). Thus the determining of the 3 truths 
(suffering, origin, path) has been first
 effected by means of mundane (lokiya, q
.v.) knowledge only." - See sammasana, 
visuddhi.
For the determining of the 4 physical 
elements, s. dha^tuvavattha^na.

 'wind-element'; s. dha^tu.

<xa>va^yo</xa>
 kasina 'wind-kasina', is one of the 
kasina exercises (kasina, q.v.).

<xa>vedana^</xa>
  'feeling', sensation, is the 2nd of 
the 5 groups of existence (s. khandha II
). According to its nature, it may be 
divided into 5 classes: (1) bodily 
agreeable feeling (ka^yika^ sukha^-
vedana^ = sukha); (2) bodily 
disagreeable feeling (ka^yika^ dukkha^-
vedana^ = dukkha^); (3) mentally 
agreeable feeling (cetasika^ sukha^-
vedana^ = somanassa); (4) mentally 
disagreeable feeling (cetasika^ dukkha^-
vedana^ = domanassa); (5) indifferent or
 neutral (adukkha-m-asukha^ vedana^ = 
upekkha^, q.v.).
With regard to the 6 senses, one 
distinguishes 6 kinds of feeling: 
<pb n="519"/>
feeling associated with seeing, hearing,
 smelling, tasting, bodily impression 
and mental impression. The textual 
wording of it is 'feeling arisen through
 visual contact' (cakkhu-samphassaja^ 
vedana^; S. XXII, 55; D. 22), etc.
Feeling is one of the 7 mental factors 
inseparably associated with all 
consciousness whatever, s. na^ma. In the
 formula of the dependent origination (
paticcasamuppa^da, q.v.), feeling is the
 condition for the arising of craving (
tanha^). The above-mentioned 5 kinds of 
feeling are enumerated amongst the 22 
faculties (indriya, q.v.). - See M. 59; 
Contemplation of Feeling (Vedana^ 
Samyutta), by Nyanaponika Thera (WHEEL 
303/304).

<xa>vedana^nupassana^</xa>

<xa>vesa^rajja</xa>
  'self-confidence' of a Buddha is 
fourfold. He is confident: 1. to have 
attained to a perfect Enlightenment of 
which it cannot be said that it omits 
anything essential to it; 2. to have 
destroyed all cankers (a^sava), leaving 
none that can be said to be undestroyed 
by him; 3. that what were declared by 
him as obstacles to liberation are 
undeniably such; 4. that his teaching 
fulfils its purpose of actually leading 
to final liberation from suffering. See 
A. IV, 8; VII, 58; M. 12.

<xa>vibhajja va^da</xa>
 'analytical or discriminating doctrine'
 is an early name for the original 
Buddha doctrine, called Therava^da. - 
The term vibhajja-va^di^ occurs in M. 99
 and A. X, 94, though not in the sense 
of a separate school, but as a 
characteristic of the Buddha himself: "
Now, by blaming what is blamable and 
praising what is praiseworthy, the 
<pb n="521"/>
Blessed One is a 'discriminating teacher
' (vibhajja-vadi^) and is not one-sided 
in his teaching" (A. X, 94).
Buddhaghosa, in the introduction to his 
Com. on the Katha^vatthu, says that in 
Asoka's time, when the Sangha prospered,
 many heretics took ordination as 
Buddhist monks but continued to spread 
their wrong doctrines. For purifying the
 Sangha, Asoka, together with the 
venerable Moggaliputtatissa, summoned 
assembly of the bhikkhus. When each of 
the assembled was individually 
questioned by the king about what the 
Buddha taught, those who said that he 
was an eternalist (sassata-vadi^), etc. 
were expelled. The genuine bhikkhus 
replied that the Buddha was a vibhajja-
vadi^, an 'analyst' or 'discriminating 
teacher'; and when, on the king's 
question, Moggaliputtatissa confirmed 
that this was the correct view, those 
monks were admitted to the Uposatha (q.v
.) assembly of the Sangha, and from 
their midst the participants of the 3rd 
Council at Pataliputta were selected. -

<xa>vicikiccha^</xa>
  'sceptical doubt', is one of the 5 
mental hindrances (ni^varana, q.v.) and 
one of the 3 fetters (samyojana, q.v.), 
which disappear for ever at Stream-entry
, the first stage of holiness (s. ariya-
puggala). As a fetter, it refers to 
sceptical doubt about the Master (the 
Buddha), the Teaching, the Sangha, and 
the training; about things past and 
future, and conditionality (Dhs. 1004; 
cf. A . X, 71 ) . It also applies to 
uncertainty whether things are wholesome
 or not, to be practised or not, of high
 or low value, etc. According to Vis.M. 
XIV, 177, vicikiccha^ is the lack of 
desire to think (things out i.e. to come
 to a conclusion; vigata-cikiccha^, 
desiderative to ? cit, to think); it has
 the nature of wavering, and its 
<pb n="523"/>
manifestation is indecision and a 
divided attitude; its proximate cause is
 unwise attention to matters of doubt. 
It is associated with one of the 2 
classes of unwholesome consciousness 
rooted in delusion (Tab. I, No. 32). -

<xa>viha^ra</xa>
  'abode' There are 3 abodes: the 
heavenly abode (dibba-viha^ra), the 
divine abode (brahma-viha^ra, q.v.), the

 knowledge and conduct'. This expression
 occurs in those passages in the suttas 
where the qualities of a Buddha are 
described, namely: Truly, the Blessed 
One is holy, is fully enlightened, 
perfect in knowledge and conduct..." 
According to Vis.M. VII, 1 and D. 3, 
knowledge (vijja^) refers here either to
 the 3-fold knowledge (s. te-vijja^), or
 to the 8 kinds of knowledge, namely: 
the 6 higher spiritual powers (abhin~n~a
^, q.v.), insight (vipassana^, q.v.), 
and magical power (iddhi, q.v.); whilst 
conduct (carana) refers to 15 things: 
moral restraint, watching over the sense
-doors, moderation in eating, 
wakefulness, faith, moral shame, moral 
dread, great learning, energy, 
mindfulness, wisdom and the 4 
absorptions.

<xa>vimokkha</xa>
  'liberation' (deliverance). I. the 3; 
II. the 8.
I. The 3 liberations are: 1. the 
conditionless (or signless) liberation (
animitta-v.), 2. the desireless 
liberation (apanihita-v.), 3. the 
emptiness (or void) liberation (sun~n~
ata^-v. ). They are also called 'the 
triple gateway to liberation' (vimokkha-
mukha; Vis.M. XXI, 66ff), as they are 
three different approaches to the paths 
of holiness. - See visuddhi VI, 8. Cf. 
Vis XXI, 6ff, 121ff; Pts.M. II. Vimokkha
-Katha^.
1. "Whosoever being filled with 
determination (adhimokkha, q.v.), 
considers all formations as impermanent 
(anicca), such a one attains the 
conditionless liberation. 2. Whosoever 
being filled with tranquillity, 
considers all formations as painful (
dukkha), such a one attains the 
desireless liberation. 3. Whosoever 
<pb n="526"/>
being filled with wisdom, considers all 
formations as without a self (anatta^), 
such a one attains the emptiness 
liberation" (Vis.M. XXI, 70 = Pts.M. II,
 p. 58).
(1) and (2) are mentioned and explained 
in M. 43, under the name of deliverances
 of mind (ceto-vimutti, q.v.). - (2) and
 (3) appear in Dhs. (344ff, 353ff) in 
the section on supermundane 
consciousness (see Atthasa^lini Tr., p. 
299ff).
II. The 8 liberations (attha vimokkha) 
occur frequently in the texts (A. VIII, 
66; D. 16, etc.) and are described as 
follows:
"There are 8 liberations, o monks. Which
 are these?
(1) ''Whilst remaining in the fine-
material sphere (rúpi^), one perceives 
corporeal forms: this is the first 
liberation.
(2) "Not perceiving corporcal forms on 
one's own person, one perceives 
corporcal forms externally: this is the 
2nd liberation.
(3) ''By thinking of the beautiful, one 
is filled with confidence: this is the 
3rd liberation.
(4) "Through the total ovcrcoming of the
<pb n="527"/>
 corporeality-perceptions, the vanishing
 of the reflex-perceptions, and the non-
attention to the multiformity-
perceptions, with the idea 'Unbounded is
 space', one reaches the sphere of 
unbounded space (a^ka^sa^nan~ca^yatana) 
and abides therein: this is the 4th 
liberation.
(5) "Through the total ovcrcoming of the
 sphere of unbounded space, and with the
 idea 'Unbounded is consciousness', one 
reaches the sphere of unbounded 
consciousness (vin~n~a^nan~ca^yatana) 
and abides therein: this is the 5th 
liberation.
(6) "Through the total overcoming of the
 sphere of unbounded consciousness, and 
with the idea 'Nothing is there', one 
reaches the sphere of nothingness (a^kin
~ean~n~a^yatana) and abides therein: 
this is the 6th liberation.
(7) "Through the total overcoming of the
 sphere of nothingness, one reaches the 
sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-
perception (n'eva-san~n~a^-na^san~n~a^
yatana) and abides therein: this is the 
7th liberation .
(8) "Through the total overcoming of the
 sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-
perception, one reaches the extinction 
<pb n="528"/>
of perception and feeling (s. nirodha-
sama^patti): this is the 8th liberation.
These, o monks, are the 8 kinds of 
liberation."
For (1-3), s. abhibha^yatana; for (4-7),
 s. jha^na; for (8), s. nirodha-sama^
patti.
By (3) is meant the attainment of the 
fine-material absorptions (jha^na, q.v.)
 by means of concentrating the mind on 
perfectly pure and bright colours as 
objects of the kasina (q.v.). According 
to Pts.M. this mental state is produced 
also by concentrating the mind on the 4 
sublime states, i.e. all-embracing 
kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy 
and equanimity, in consequence of which 
allbeings appear perfectly pure and 
glorified, and thus the mind turns to 
the beautiful.
See Pts.M. II, Vimokkha-katha^; Atthasa^
lini Tr., p. 255; App.

<xa>vimutti</xa>
  'deliverance', is of 2 kinds: 
deliverance of mind (ceto-vimutti, q.v.)
 and deliverance through wisdom (pan~n~a
^-vimutti, q.v.).
'Deliverance of mind', in the highest 
sense, is that kind of concentration (
<pb n="529"/>
sama^dhi) which is bound up with the 
path of Arahatship (arahatta-magga); '
deliverance through wisdom' is the 
knowledge (n~a^na) bound up with the 
fruition of Arahatship (arahatta-phala).
 Cf. A. V, 142.
There are also 5 kinds of deliverance, 
identical with the 5 kinds of overcoming
 (paha^na, q.v.).

<xa>vinipa^ta</xa>
  'world of suffering', is another name 
for the 4 woeful courses (duggati; s. 
gati) of existence, and for the 4 lower 
worlds (apa^ya, q.v.).
The Stream-Winner (sota^panna, q.v.) is 
no longer subject to rebirth in them (
avinipa^ta-dhamma).

<xa>vin~n~a^na</xa>
  'consciousness', is one of the 5 
groups of existence (aggregates; khandha
, q.v.); one of the 4 nutriments (a^ha^
ra, q.v.); the 3rd link of the dependent
 origination (paticcasamuppa^da, q.v.); 
the 5th in the sixfold division of 
elements (dha^tu, q.v.).
Viewed as one of the 5 groups (khandha),
 it is inseparably linked with the 3 
other mental groups (feeling, perception
<pb n="530"/>
 and formations) and furnishes the bare 
cognition of the object, while the other
 3 contribute more specific functions. 
Its ethical and karmic character, and 
its greater or lesser degree of 
intensity and clarity, are chiefly 
determined by the mental formations 
associated with it.
Just like the other groups of existence,
 consciousness is a flux (vin~n~a^na-
sota^, 'stream of c.') and does not 
constitute an abiding mind-substance; 
nor is it a transmigrating entity or 
soul. The 3 characteristies (s. ti-
lakkhana), impermanence, suffering and 
no-self, are frequently applied to it in
 the texts (e.g., in the Anattalakkhana 
Sutta, S.XXII, 59). The Buddha often 
stressed that "apart from conditions, 
there is no arising of consciousness' (M
 38); and all these statements about its
 nature hold good for the entire range 
of consciousness, be it "past, future or
 presently arisen, gross or subtle, in 
oneself or external, inferior or lofty, 
far or near" (S. XXII, 59).
According to the 6 senses it divides 
into 6 kinds, viz. eye- (or visual) 
consciousness (cakkhu-v.), etc. About 
the dependent arising of these 6 kinds 
<pb n="531"/>
of consciousness, Vis.M. XV, 39 says: '
Conditioned through the eye, the visible
 object, light and attention, eye-
consciousness arises. Conditioned 
through the ear, the audible object, the
 ear-passage and attention, ear-
consciousness arises. Conditioned, 
through the nose, the olfactive object, 
air and attention, nose-consciousness 
arises. Conditioned through the tongue, 
the gustative object, humidity and 
attention, tongue-consciousness arises. 
Condlitioned through the body, bodily 
impression, the earth-element and 
attention, body-consciousness arises. 
Conditioned through the subconscious 
mind (bhavanga-mano), the mind-object 
and attention, mind-consciousness arises
."
The Abhidhamma literature distinguishes 
89 crasses of consciousness, being 
either karmically wholesome, unwholesome
 or neutral, and belonging either to the
 sense-sphere, the fine-material or the 
immaterial sphere, or to supermundane 
consciousness. See Table I.

<xa>vin~n~a^na kicca</xa>
 'functions of consciousness', as 
exercised within a process of 
<pb n="532"/>
consciousness or cognitive series (
cittavi^thi). In the Abhidhamma Com. and
 Vis.M. XIV the following functions are 
mentioned: rebirth (patisandhi), 
subconsciousness (bhavanga), advertence 
(a^vajjana), seeing, hearing, smelling, 
tasting, body-consciousness; recciving (
sampaticchana), investigating (santi^
rana), determining (votthapana), 
impulsion (javana), registering (tada^
rammana), dying (cuti).
A single unit of sense-perception (e.g. 
visual consciousness), being conditioned
 through a sense-organ and its 
corresponding object, forms in reality 
an extremely complex process, in which 
all the single phases of consciousness 
follow one upon another in rapid 
succession, while performing their 
respective functions, e.g.:
"As soon as a visible object has entered
 the range of vision, it acts on the 
sensitive eye-organ (cakkhu-pasa^da), 
and conditioned thereby an excitation of
 the subconscious stream (bhavanga-sota)
 takes place.
"As soon, however, as subconsciousness 
is broken off, the functional mind-
element (s. Tab. I, 70), grasping the 
object and breaking through the 
<pb n="533"/>
subconscious stream, performs the 
function of 'adverting' the mind towards
 the object (a^vajjana).
"Immediately thereupon there arises at 
the eye-door, and based on the sensitive
 eye-organ, the eye-consciousness, while
 performing the function of 'seeing' (
dassana).... Immediately thereafter 
there arises the mind-element (Tab
I, 39, 55) performing the function of '
receiving' (sampaticchana) the object of
 that consciousness....
''Immediately thereafter there arises...
 the mind-consciousness-element (Tab. I,
 40, 41, 56), while 'investigating' (
santirana) the object received by the 
mind-element...
"Immediately thereafter there arises the
 functional, rootless mind-consciousness
-element (Tab. I, 71), accompanied by 
indifference, while performing the 
function of 'determining' (votthapana) 
the object......
"Now, if the object is large, then 
immediately afterwards there flash forth
 6 or 7 'impulsive moments' (javana-
citta), constituted by one of the 8 
wholesome, or 12 unwholesome, or 9 
functional classes of consciousness (Tab
. I, 1-8; 22-23; 72-80).
<pb n="534"/>
''Now, if at the end of the impulsive 
moments, the object at the five-sense 
doors is very large, and at the mind-
door clear, then there arises, once or 
twice, one of the 8 root-accompanied, 
karma-resultant classes of consciousness
 (Tab. I, 42-49) of the sense-sphere, or
 one of the 3 rootless karma-resultant 
mind-consciousness-elements (Tab. I, 40,
 41, 56).... Because this consciousness 
after the vanishing of the impulsive 
moments, possesses the faculty 
continuing with the object of the 
subconsciousness, taking the object of 
the subconsciousness as its own object, 
therefore it is called 'registering' (
tada^rarmmana, lit. 'that object', or '
having that as object')" (Vis.M. XIV, 
115ff).
If, however, the sense-object is weak, 
then it reaches merely the stage of '
impulsion' (javana), or of 'determining'
 (votthapana); if very weak, only an 
excitation ot the subconsciousness takes
 place.
The proeess of the inner or mind-
consciousness, i.e. without 
participation of the 5 physical senses, 
is as follows: in the case that the mind
-objeet entering the mind-door is 
<pb n="535"/>
distinct, then it passes through the 
stages of 'advertence at the mind-door' 
(manodva^ra^vajjana), the 'impulsive 
stage' and the 'registering stage', 
before finally sinking into the 
subconscious stream. - (App.: citta-vi^
thi).

<xa>vin~n~a^nan~ca^yatana</xa>
  'sphere of boundless consciousn is a 
name for the 2nd meditiative absorption 
in the immateria sphere (s. jha^na, 6).

<xa>vin~n~a^na tthiti</xa>
 'abodes or supports of consciousness'. 
The texts describe 7 such abodes (e.g. A
. VII, 41):
(1) "There are beings who are different 
in body and different in perception, 
such as men, some heavenly beings, and 
some beings living in states of 
suffering (s. apa^ya). This is the 1st 
abode of consciousness.
<pb n="536"/>
(2) "There are beings who are different 
in body but equal in perception, such as
 the first-born gods of the Brahmaworld 
(s. deva II). This is the 2nd abode of 
consciousness.
(3) "There are beings who are equal in 
body but different in perception, such 
as the Radiant Gods (a^bhassara-deva). 
This is the 3rd abode of consciousness.
(4) ''There are beings who are equal in 
body and equal in perception, such as 
the All-illuminating Gods (subhakinha-
deva). This is the 4th abode of 
consciousness.
(5) "There are beings ... reborn in the 
sphere of boundless space. This is the 
5th abode of consciousness.
(6) "There are beings ... reborn in the 
sphere of boundless consciousness. This 
is the 6th abode of consciousness.
(7) There are beings... reborn in the 
sphere of nothingness. This is the 7th 
abode of consciousness"
About the 3 last-named spheres, s. jha^
na (5-7). Cf. satta^va^sa.
In D. 33 there are mentioned 4 vin~n~a^
na-tthiti, apparently in the sense of '
bases' of consciousness, namely: 
corporeality, feeling, perception, 
mental formations, which in S. XXII, 53 
<pb n="537"/>
are further explained.

<xa>vin~n~atti</xa>
  (lit. 'making known') 'intimation', is
 an Abhidhamma term for bodily 
expression (ka^ya-vin~n~atti) and verbal
 expression (vaci^-vin~n~atti), both 
belonging to the corporeality-group. 
They are produced by the co-nascent 
volition, and are therefore, as such, 
purely physical and not to be confounded
 with karma (q.v.), which as such is 
something mental. Cf. Kath. 80, 100, 101
, 103, 194 (s. Guide V). - (App.).
"One speaks of 'bodily expression', 
because it makes known an intention by 
means of bodily movement, and can itself
 be understood by the bodily movement 
which is said to be corporeal.
" 'Verbal expression' is so called 
because it makes known an intention by 
means of a speech-produced noise" (Vis.M
. XIV).

<xa>vipacitan~n~u</xa>
 (or vipan~citan~n~u): 'one who realizes
 the truth after explanation.' Thus is 
called one who realizes the truth only 
after detailed explanation of that which
 already had been said to him in a 
<pb n="538"/>
concise form. Cf. ugghatitan~n~u.

<xa>vipa^ka</xa>
  'karma-result', is any karmically (
morally) neutral mental phenomenon (e.g.
 bodily agreeable or painful feeling, 
sense-consciousness, etc. ), which is 
the result of wholesome or unwholesome 
volitional action (karma, q.v.) through 
body, speech or mind, done either in 
this or some previous life. Totally 
wrong is the belief that, according to 
Buddhism, everything is the result of 
previous action. Never, for example, is 
any karmically wholesome or unwholesome 
volitional action the result of former 
action, being in reality itself karma. 
On this subject s. tittha^yatana, karma,
 Tab. I; Fund II. Cf. A. III, 101; Kath.
 162 (Guide, p. 80).
Karma-produced (kammaja or kamma-
samuttha^na) corporeal things are never 
called kamma-vipa^ka, as this term may 
be applied only to mental phenomena.

<xa>vipa^ka paccaya</xa>
 'karma-result condition' is one of the 
24 conditions (paccaya, q.v.).

<xa>vipalla^sa</xa>
<pb n="539"/>
  'perversions' or 'distortions'. - ''
There are 4 perversions which may be 
either of perception (san~n~a^-vipalla^
sa), of consciousness (citta v.) or of 
views (ditthi-v.). And which are these 
four? To regard what is impermanent (
anicca) as permanent; what is painful (
dukkha) as pleasant (or happiness-
yielding); what is without a self (
anatta^) as a self; what is impure (ugly
: asubha) as pure or beautiful'' (A. IV,
 49). - See Manual of Insight, by Ledi 
Sayadaw (WHEEL 31/32). p.5.
"Of the perversions, the following are 
eliminated by the 1st path-knowledge (
sota^patti): the perversions of 
perception, consciousness and views, 
that the impermanent is permanent and 
what is not a self is a self; further, 
the perversion of views that the painful
 is pleasant, and the impure is pure. By
 the 3rd path-knowledge (ana^ga^mita^) 
are eliminated: the perversions of 
perception and consciousness that the 
impure is pure. By the 4th path-
knowledge (arahatta) are eliminated the 
perversions of perception and 
consciousness that the painful is 
pleasant" (Vis.M. XXII, 68).

<pb n="540"/>
<xa>viparina^ma^nupassana^</xa>
  'contemplation of change' (of all 
things), is one of the 18 chief kinds of
 insight (vipassana^, q.v.).

<xa>vipassana^</xa>
  'insight', is the intuitive light 
flashing forth and exposing the truth of
 the impermanency, the suffering and the
 impersonal and unsubstantial nature of 
all corporeal and mental phenomena of 
existence. It is insight-wisdom (
vipassana^-pan~n~a^) that is the 
decisive liberating factor in Buddhism, 
though it has to be developed along with
 the 2 other trainings in morality and 
concentration. The culmination of 
insight practice (s. visuddhi VI) leads 
directly to the stages of holiness (s. 
visuddhi VII).
Insight is not the result of a mere 
intellectual understanding, but is won 
through direct meditative observation of
 one's own bodily and mental processes. 
In the commentaries and the Vis.M., the 
sequene in developing insight-meditation
 is given as follows: 1. discernment of 
the corporeal (rúpa), 2. of the mental (
na^ma), 3. contemplation of both (na^mar
úpa; i.e. of their pairwise occurrence 
<pb n="541"/>
in actual events, and their 
interdependence), 4. both viewed as 
conditioned (application of the 
dependent origination, paticcasamuppa^da
), 5. application of the 3 
characteristics (impermanency, etc.) to 
mind-and-body-cum-conditions.
The stages of gradually growing insight 
are described in the 9insight- 
knowledges (vipassana^-n~a^na), 
constituting the 6th stage of 
purification: beginning with the '
knowledge of rise and fall' and ending 
with the 'adaptation to Truth'. For 
details, see visuddhi VI and Vis.M. XXI.
Eighteen chief kinds of insight-
knowledge (or principal insights, maha^-
vipassana^) are listed and described in 
Vis.M. XXII, 113: (1) contemplation of 
impermanence (anicca^nupassana^), (2) of
 suffering (dukkha^nupassana^), (3) of 
no self (anatta^nupnupassana^), (4) of 
aversion (nibbida^nupassana^). (5) of 
detachment (vira^ga^nupassana^), (6) of 
extinction (nirodha^nupassana^), (7) of 
abandoning (patinissagga^nupassana^), (8
) of waning (khaya^nupassana^), (9) of 
vanishing (vaya^nupassana^), (10) of 
change (viparina^ma^nupassana^), (11) of
 the unconditioned (or signless, 
<pb n="542"/>
animitta^nupassana^), (12) of 
desirelessness (apanihita^nupassana^), (
13) of emptiness (sun~n~ata^upassana^), 
(14) insight into phenomena which is 
higher wisdom (adhipan~n~a^-dhamma-
vipassana^), (15) knowledge and vision 
according to reality (yatha^-bhúta-n~a^
nadassana), (16) contemplation of misery
 (or danger, a^di^nava^nupassana^), (17)
 reflecting contemplation (patisankha^
nupassana^), (18) contemplation of 
turning away (vivattana^nupassana^).
Through these 18, the adverse ideas and 
views are overcome, for which reason 
this way of overcoming is called '
overcoming by the opposite' (tadanga-
paha^na, overcoming this factor by that)
. Thus (1) dispels the idea of 
permanence. (2) the idea of happiness, (
3) the idea of self, (4) lust, (5) greed
, (6) origination, (7) grasping, (8) the
 idea of compactness, (9) karma-
accumulation, (10) the idea of 
lastingness, (11) the conditions, (12) 
delight, (13) adherence, (14) grasping 
and adherence to the idea of substance, 
(15) attachment and adherence, (17) 
thoughtlessness, (18) dispels 
entanglement and clinging.
Insight may be either mundane (lokiya, q
<pb n="543"/>
.v.) or supermundane (lokuttara, q.v.). 
Supermundane insight is of 3 kinds: (1) 
joined with one of the 4 supermundane 
paths, (2) joined with one of the 
fruitions of these paths, (3) regarding 
the extinction, or rather suspension, of
 consciousness (s. nirodha-sama^patti).

<xa>vipassanúpakkilesa</xa>
  'imperfections of insight'; s. 
visuddhi.

<xa>vipatti</xa>
  'aberration' or 'deviation', may be: 
deviation from morality (si^la-vipatti),
 or deviation from understanding (
ditthivipatti).
"To deviate in deeds, or in words, or in
 both deeds and words: this is called 
deviation from morality.
<pb n="544"/>
" 'Alms and offerings are useless, there
 is no fruit and result of good and bad 
actions, there are no such things as 
this and the next life' .... Such wrong

understanding." (Pug. 67, 68)

<xa>vippayutta paccaya</xa>
 'dissociation', is one of the 24 
conditions (paccaya, q.v.).

<xa>vira^ga</xa>
  'fading away', detachment; absence of 
lust, dispassionateness. Appears 
frequently together with nirodha, '
cessation' (1) as a name for Nibba^na, (

 4th tetrad in the exercises in 
mindfulness of breathing (s. a^na^pa^
nasati 14), (b) of the 18 principal 
insights (No. 5); s. vipassana^.
According to Com., it may mean (1) the 
momentary destruction of phenomena, or (
2) the ultimate 'fading away', i.e. 
Nibba^na. In the aforementioned two 
contemplations, it means the 
understanding of both, and the path 
attained by such understanding.

  the 3 'abstentions' or abstinences, 
are: abstention from wrong speech, wrong
 (bodily) action and wrong livelihood; 
corresponding to right speech, action 
and livelihood of the 8-fold Path (s. 
magga, 3-5). By abstention is not simply
 meant the non-occurrence of the evil 
things in question, but the deliberate 
abstaining therefrom, whenever occasion 
arises. They belong to the 'secondary' (

<xa>visuddhi</xa>
  'purification', purity. The '7 stages 
of purification' (satta-visuddhi) form 
the substructure of Upatissa's Vimutti-
Magga (The Path To Freedom), preserved 
only in Chinese, as well as of 
Buddhaghosa's monumental work, Visuddhi-
Magga (The Path of Purification), based 
on the former work.
The only place in the Canon where these 
7 kinds of purification are mentioned is
 M. 24, "The Simile of the Stage-coach" 
(s. 'Path', §64), wherein their purpose 
<pb n="547"/>
and goal are illustrated. There it is 
said that the real and ultimate goal 
does not consist in purification of 
morality, or of mind, or of view, etc., 
but in total deliverance and extinction.
 Now, just as one mounts the first coach
 and travels to the second coach, then 
mounts the second coach and travels with
 it to the third coach, etc., in exactly
 the same way the goal of (I) the 
purification of morality (sila-visuddhi)
 is (II) the purification of mind (citta
-visuddhi); its goal: (III) the 
purification of view (ditthi-visuddhi); 
its goal: (IV) the purification by 
overcoming doubt (kankha^vitarana-
visuddhi); its goal: (V) the 
purification by knowledge and vision of 
what is path and not-path (magga^magga-n
~a^nadassana-visuddhi); its goal: (VI) 
the purification by knowledge and vision
 of the path-progress (patipada^-n~a^
nadassana-visuddhi); its goal: (VII) the
 purification of knowledge and vision (n
~a^nadassana-visuddhi); but the goal of 
this purification is deliverance freed 
from all clinging.
(I) "Purification of morality (si^la-
visuddhi) consists of the 4-fold purity 
of morality (catu-pa^risuddhi-si^la), 
<pb n="548"/>
namely: restraint with regard to the 
Disciplinary Code (pa^timokkhasamvara-si
^la), sense-restraint (indriysamvara-si^
la), purity of livelihood (a^ji^vapa^
risuddhi-si^la), morality with regard to
 the 4 requisites (paccaya-sannissita-si
^la)" (Vis.M. XVIII). On these 4 terms, 
s. si^la. - In the case of a layman, it 
entails the observance of whatever moral
 rules (5 or more) he has taken upon 
himself.
(II) "Purification of mind (citta-
visuddhi) is a name for the 8 
attainments (= absorptions: jha^na, q.v.
), as well as for neighbourhood-
concentration (upaca^ra-sama^dhi; s. 
sama^dhi)." (ib.).
(III) "By purification of view (ditthi-
visuddhi) is meant the understanding, 
according to reality, of mind and 
corporeality (na^marúpa, q.v.)... which 
is founded on undeludedness (wisdom) as 
base, and which in manifold ways 
determines mind and corporeality after 
overcoming all belief in a persollality 
(atta^: self, ego.)." (ib.).
(IV) "By purification by overcoming 
doubt (kankha^-vitarana-visuddhi) is 
meant the understanding which, by 
grasping the conditions of this mind and
<pb n="549"/>
 corporeality, has escaped from all 
doubt with regard to the 3 times (past, 
present, future)." (ib. XIX)
(V) "By purification by knowledge and 
vision of what is path and not-path (
magga^magga-n~a^nadassana-visuddhi) is 
meant that understanding which knows the
 right path from the wrong path: 'This 
is the right path, that the wrong path.'
 " (ib. XX)
In order to attain this 5th stage of 
purification, one at first should 
develop methodical insight (naya-
vipassana^), i.e. through contemplation 
of the 5 groups of existence (khandha, q
.v.). For whosoever does not yet possess
 a perfectly developed insight, to him 
such phenomena as effulgence of light, 
etc. (see below), arising during insight
, may become impediments in the 3 kinds 
of full understanding here considered (s
. parin~n~a^).
'As soon as the manifold ways and 
characteristics of the 4 Truths (sacca) 
and the dependent origination (
paticcasamuppa^da) have become clear to 
the meditating disciple, he says to 
himself: Thus do these things never 
before arisen arise, and having arisen 
they disappear again. Thus do the 
<pb n="550"/>
formations of existence ever and again 
arise as something quite new. But not 
only are they something new, they are 
moreover also of limited duration, like 
a dew-drop at sunrise, like a bubble, 
like a line drawn with a stick in the 
water, like a mustard seed placed on the
 point of an arrow, or like a flash of 
lightning. Also as something 
unsubstantial and empty do they appear, 
as jugglery, as a mirage .... Merely 
something subject to vanishing arises, 
and having arisen disappears again.' "
During such insight practice, however, 
may arise the 10 imperfections (or 
defilements) of insight (vipassanú
pakkilesa): effulgence of light (obha^sa
), knowledge (n~a^na), rapture (pi^ti), 
tranquillity (passaddhi), happiness (
sukha), determination (adhimokkha), 
energy (paggaha), awareness (upattha^na)
, delight (nikanti). - See Vis.M. XX, 
105f. (App.).
Excepting the last one, 'delight', they 
are not imperfections or defilements in 
themselves, but may become a basis for 
them through the arising of pride or 
delight or by a wrong conclusion that 
one of the holy paths has been attained.
 He, however, who is watchful and 
<pb n="551"/>
experienced in insight practice, will 
know that these states of mind do not 
indicate attainment of the true path, 
but are only symptoms or concomitants of
 insight meditation.
"Thus far the meditating disciple has 
determined 3 of the truths, namely while
 determining the corporeal and mental 
phenomena he has, through purification 
of view (ditthi-visuddhi), determined 
the 'truth of suffering'. While grasping
 the conditions he has, through 
purification by overcoming doubt (kankha
^-vitarana-visuddhi), determined the '
truth of the origin of suffering'. While
 determining the right path, he has, 
through purification by knowledge and 
vision of what is path and not-path (
magga^magga-n~a^nadassana-visuddhi), 
determined the 'truth of the path' (
leading to the extinction of suffering).
"
(VI) Purification by knowledge and 
vision of the path-progress (patipada^-n
~a^nadassana-visuddhi) is the insight 
perfected in 8 kinds of knowledge, 
together with the 9th knowledge, the '
knowledge adapting itself to truth'.
By the 8 kinds of knowledge are here 
meant the following, which are freed 
<pb n="552"/>
from defilements, follow the right 
process, and are considered as insight, 
namely:
 
1. knowledge consisting in contemplation
 of rise and fall (udayabbaya^nupassana^
-n~a^na),
2. in contemplation of dissolution (
bhanga^nupassana^-n~a^na),
3. in awareness of terror (or the 
fearful) (bhayatúpattha^na^-n~a^na),
4. in contemplation of misery (a^di^nava
^nupassana^-n~a^na),
5. in contemplation of aversion (nibbida
^nupassana^-n~a^na),
6. in the desire for deliverance (
muccitu-kamyata^-n~a^na),
7. in reflecting contemplation (
patisankha^nupassana^-n~a^na),
8. in equanimity regarding all 
formations of existence (sankha^rupekkha
^-n~a^na) - which is followed by
9. in adaptation to truth (sacca^
nulomika-n~a^na).
 
(1) consists in the meditative 
observation of the 3 characteristics of 
existence (impermanence, suffering, no 
self) in one's own bodily and mental 
processes. As long as the mind is still 
<pb n="553"/>
disturbed by the 10 imperfections (s. V)
, the 3 characteristics will not become 
fully clear in their true nature. Only 
when the mind is free from these 
imperfections can the characteristics be
 observed clearly.
(2) When through such repeated practice,
 knowledge and mindfulness have grown 
keen and the bodily and mental 
formations become apparent quickly, at 
that stage the phase of dissolution of 
these formations will become prominent.
"Consciousness with (e.g.) materiality 
as its object arises and dissolves. 
Having reflected on that object, he 
contemplates the dissolution of (
reflecting) consciousness." (Pts.M. I, 
57, quoted in Vis.M. XXI, 11).
The 8 blessings of this knowledge are: 
abandoning the belief in eternal 
existence (bhava-ditthi), giving up 
attachment to life, constant right 
application (of mind to meditative 
endeavour), a purified livelihood, 
overcoming of anxiety, absence of fear, 
acquisition of forbearance and 
gentleness, conquest of discontent and 
sensual delight (Vis.M. XXI, 28).
(3) Knowledge consisting in awareness of
 terror (or fearfulness) is the seeing 
<pb n="554"/>
of terror in the conditions as well as 
the continuity of existence. For whoso 
considers the formations as impermanent,
 to him the conditions of existence (i.e
. the karma-formations producing ever 
new existence) appear as terror, as 
driving towards death. Whoso considers 
the formations as misery, to him the 
continuity of existence appears as 
terror, as something oppressive. Whoso 
considers the formations as impersonal, 
to him the karmaformations, as well as 
the continuity of existence, appear as 
terror, as an empty village, as a mirage
, etc.
(4) Contemplation of misery (or danger) 
is another aspect of the awareness of 
terror: "The origin (of existence) is 
terror ... continuance of existence is 
terror ... arising is suffering', such 
understanding in the awareness of terror
 is the knowledge of misery. 'Non-
arising is bliss', this is knowledge of 
the peaceful state (Pts.M. I, 59); that 
is, the no-more-arising is safety, is 
happiness, is Nibba^na.
(5) Contemplation of aversion means: 
aversion for all formations as terror, 
therefore its name 'awareness of terror'
 has come into use. Because it has made 
<pb n="555"/>
known the misery of all these formations
, therefore it has received the name of 
'contemplation of misery' (a^di^nava^
nupassana^). Because it has arisen 
through aversion for those formations, 
therefore it is known as 'contemplation 
of aversion' (nibbida^nupassana^).
(6) Knowledge consisting in the desire 
for deliverance means: the desire for 
freedom and escape from all formations 
of existence.. For feeling aversion for 
all formations, becoming weary of them, 
finding no more delight in them, the 
mind does not cling to a single one of 
all these formations.
(7) Reflecting contemplation is the 
repeated meditative discernment of the 
formations of existence, attributing to 
them the 3 characteristics of existence,
 with the desire to find deliverance 
from all forms of existence.
(8) Equanimity regarding all formations:
 "When the meditator (through reflecting
 contemplation) has discerned the 
formations by applying the 3 
characteristics to them and sees them as
 void, he abandons both terror and 
delight, and becomes indifferent and 
equanimous with regard to all formations
; he neither takes them as I nor as '
<pb n="556"/>
mine'; he is like a man who has divorced
 his wife" (Vis.M. XXI, 61).
Now, while continuing to contemplate the
 3 characteristics of existence and 
perceiving the tranquil lot of Nibba^na 
as the peace, this equanimity-knowledge 
becomes the triple gateway to liberation
. As it is said (Pts.M. II, p. 48):
"Three gateways to liberation (vimokkha-
mukha; s. vimokkha I) lead to escape 
from the world, namely: that the mind is
 contemplating all formations as limited
, and is rushing forward to the 
conditionless element (animitta-dha^tu);
 that the mind is stirred with regard to
 all formations of existence, and is 
rushing forward to the desireless 
element (appanihita-dha^tu); that the 
mind sees all things as something 
foreign, and is rushing forward to the 
void element (sun~n~ata^-dha^tu)."
At this stage, and through the triple 
gateway, the diversification of path 
attainment takes place, according to the
 7 kinds of noble persons (ariya-puggala
, q.v.); on this see Vis.M. XXI, 74ff.
The 6th, 7th and 8th knowledges, 
according to Vis.M. XXI, form really 
only one single knowledge in its first, 
middle and final stages of development. 
<pb n="557"/>
This knowledge is also known as the '
insight leading to path ascent' (vuttha^
na-ga^mini^-vipassana^, q.v.).
(9) Adaptation to truth (or conformity 
with truth) is called that knowledge 
which, while contemplating impermanency,
 etc. adapts itself to the preceding 8 
kinds of insight-knowledge, as well as 
to the immediately following 
supermundane path and to the 37 elements
 pertaining to enlightenment (
bodhipakkhiya-dhamma, q.v.). It is 
identical with adaptation-knowledge (
anuloman~a^na).
"Whosoever has cultivated, developed, 
and frequently practised 'equanimity 
regarding all formations' in him arises 
very strong faith known as determination
 (adhimokkha-saddha^) and his energy is 
better exerted, his mindfulness better 
established, his mind better 
concentrated, and a still stronger '
equanimity regarding the formations' 
arises. 'Now the path will reveal itself
', thus thinking, the meditator 
contemplates with his equanimity-
knowledge all formations as impermanent,
 etc., and thereafter that knowledge 
sinks into the subconscious stream of 
existence (s. bhavanga-sota^). 
<pb n="558"/>
Immediately afterwards there arises 
advertence at the mind-door (s. vin~n~a^
na-kicca). And just like equanimity-
knowledge, the adaptation-knowledge, too
, takes as its object the formations, 
regarding them as something impermanent,
 miserable and impersonal. Thereupon, 
while continuing the uninterrupted 
continuity of consciousness (citta-
santati), there arises the 1st impulsive
 moment (javana, q.v.), called '
preparation' (parikamma), taking the 
same formations as object. Immediately 
thereafter, with the same formations as 
object, there arises the 2nd impulsive 
moment, known as 'access' (upaca^ra). 
And again immediately after that, there 
arises the impulsive moment called '
adaptation' (anuloma)."
(VII) Purification of knowledge and 
vision (n~a^nadassana-visuddhi) is the 
knowledge associated with any of the 4 
kinds of supermundane path-consciousness
 (s. ariyapuggala).
"Immediately upon this adaptation-
knowledge there arises the 'maturity-
knowlege' (gotrabhú-n~a^na; s. gotrabhú)
 taking as object the Unconditioned, the
 standstill of existence, the absence of
 becoming, cessation, Nibba^na, while at
<pb n="559"/>
 the same time transcending the rank (
gotta = gotra: lineage), designation and
 plane of the worldling (puthujjana, q.v
.), and entering the rank, designation 
and plane of the Noble Ones (ariya), 
being the first turning towards Nibba^na
 as object, the first thinking of it, 
the first concentration on it, and the 
condition for the path ... forming the 
culmination of insight, and never as 
such coming back again.
''As the immediate continuation 
following upon that maturity knowledge (
gotrabhú-n~a^na), there arises the first
 path-consciousness (Stream-entrance) 
forever destroying the first 3 of the 10
 fetters of existence (samyojana, q.v.),
 and closing the entrance to the lower 
worlds. Immediately after this path-
knowledge, there arise, as its result, 2
 or 3 path-produced states of 
consciousness, the fruitional 
consciousness (phala-citta). Immediately
 after the sinking of this consciousness
 into the subconscious stream of 
existence, the retrospective knowledge (
paccavekkhana-n~a^na, q.v.) arises, 
having the path-consciousness as its 
object" (Vis.M. XXI). For the 3 higher 
paths, s. ariya-puggala.
<pb n="560"/>
Each of the 4 kinds of path-
consciousness performs at the one and 
the same time 4 functions, namely: the 
function of full understanding (parin~n~
a^, q.v.) of suffering, the function of 
overcoming (paha^na, q.v.) the origin of
 suffering, the function of realizing (
sacchikiriya^) the extinction of 
suffering, the function of developing (
bha^vana^, q.v.) the supermundane Noble 
Eightfold Path (magga, q.v.).
See Path of Purification, by Buddhaghosa
, tr. by n~yanamoli (BPS); Path of 
Freedom, by Upatissa (BPS).

<xa>vitakka</xa>
  'thought', 'thought-conception', is 
one of the 'secondary' (not constant) 
mental concomitants (s. Tab. II), and 
may be either karmically wholesome, 
unwholesome or neutral. - "There are 3 
karmically unwholesome (akusala) 
thoughts: sensuous thought (ka^ma-
vitakka), hating thought (bya^pa^da-v.),
 and cruel thought (vihimsa-v.). There 
are 3 karmically wholesome (kusala) 
thoughts: thought of renunciation (
nekkhamma-v.), of hatelessness (avya^pa^
da-v.), of not harming (avihimsa^-v.) " 
The latter three constitute 'right 
<pb n="561"/>
thought', the 2nd link of the 8-fold 
Path (s. magga 2).

 (vitakka-santha^na), s. M. 20 (tr. in

<xa>vitakka vica^ra</xa>
 'thought-conception and discursive 
thinking', (or 'applied and sustained 
thought') are verbal functions (vaci^-
sankha^ra: s. sankha^ra) of the mind, 
the so-called 'inner speech ('parole 
interieure'). They are constituents of 
the 1st absorption (s. jha^na), but 
absent in the higher absorptions.
(1) "Thought-conception (vitakka) is the
 laying hold of a thought, giving it 
attention. Its characteristic consists 
in fixing the consciousness to the 
object.
(2) "Discursive thinking (vica^ra) is 
the roaming about and moving to and fro 
of the mind.... It manifests itself as 
continued activity of mind" (Vis.M. IV).
(1) is compared with the striking 
against a bell, (2) with its resounding;
 (1) with the seizing of a pot, (2) with
 wiping it. (Cf. Vis . IV.).

<xa>vivattana^nupassana^</xa>
  'contemplation of the turning away', 
is one of the 18 chief kinds of insight 
(vipassana^, q.v.). - (App.).

<xa>viveka</xa>
  'detachment', seclusion, is according 
to Niddesa, of 3 kinds: (1) bodily 
detachment (ka^ya-viveka), i.e. abiding 
in solitude free from alluring sensuous 
objects; (2) mental detachment (citta-
viveka), i.e. the inner detachment from 
sensuous things; (3) detachment from the
<pb n="563"/>
 substrata of existence (upadhi-viveka).
In the description of the 1st absorption
, the words "detached from sensuous 
things" (vivicc' eva ka^mehi) refer, 
according to Vis.M. IV, to 'bodily 
detachment'; the words "detached from 
karmically unwholesome things" (vivicca 
akusalehi dhammehi) refer to 'mental 
detachment'; the words "born of 
detachment" (vivekaja), to the absence 
of the 5 hindrances.

<xa>viveka sukha</xa>
 'happiness of detachment', or aloofness
 (s. prec). "Whoso is addicted to 
society and worldly bustle, he will not 
partake of the happiness of renunciation
, detachment, peace and enlightenment" (
A. VII, 86).

<xa>voda^na</xa>
  'cleansing', may refer either to (1) 
morality (si^la), or (2) concentration (
sama^dhi), or (3) wisdom (pan~n~a^).
(1) "Cleansing of morality takes place 
in 2 ways: by understanding the misery 
of moral deviation (si^la-vipatti; s. 
vipatti) and by understanding the 
blessing of moral perfection (si^la-
sampatti)" (s. Vis.M. I).
<pb n="564"/>
(2) Cleansing of concentration is 
concentration connected with progress (
visesa-bha^giya-sama^dhi; s. ha^na-bha^
giya). If, for example, one has entered 
the 1st absorption, and sensuous 
perceptions and reflections arise, in 
that case there is concentration 
connected with decline ... If, however, 
perceptions and reflections free from 
thought-conception and discursive 
thinking (2nd jha^na; q.v.) arise, in 
that case there is concentration 
connected with progress.
(3) Cleansing, with reference to wisdom,
 is identical with the 'insight leading 
to the (path) ascent' (vuttha^na-ga^mini
^-vipassana^, q.v.), which arises at the
 stage of 'purification by knowledge and
 vision of the path-progress' (s. 
visuddhi VI), and is followed 
immediately by the maturity moment and 
the entrance into the supermundane paths
.

<xa>voha^ra desana^</xa>
 'conventional exposition', as

process of sense-perception performs the
 function of determining the sense-
object. It is one of the 14 functions of
 consciousness (vin~n~a^na-kicca, q.v.).

<xa>vuttha^na ga^mini^ vipassana^</xa>
 'insight leading to (path) ascent'. It 
is also called 'cleansing' (voda^na, q.v
.), and according to Pts.M. II, 64, it 
is a name for 3 kinds of insight-
knowledge, namely: knowledge consisting 
in the desire for deliverance (muccitu-
kamyata^-n~a^na; s. visuddhi VI 6); 
reflecting-contemplation-knowledge (
patisankha^nupassana^-n~a^na; ib. VI, 7)
; and knowledge consisting in equanimity
<pb n="566"/>
 regarding all formations (sankha^
rupekkha^-n~a^na; s. visuddhi VI, 8).
It arises at the stage of 'purification 
by knowledge and vision of the path-
progress' (s. visuddhi VI), and is 
followed immediately by the maturity 
moment and the entrance into the 
supermundane paths.
" 'Ascent' (vuttha^na) is the 
supermundane path (s. ariya-puggala) 
since it rises above the object forming 
the external foundation (of insight; i.e
. the external 5 groups of existence), 
in which object one's mind was absorbed,
 and also rises above one's own 
continuity (one's own 5 groups of 
existence, or khandha, q.v.) together 
with its defilements. By reason of its 
leading upwards to the supermundane path
, this insight is called 'ascending 
insight'. That it passes on to the path:
 that is the meaning implied" (Vis.M. 
XXI, 83f.). (App.).

<xa>yoga^vacara = yogi</xa>
<pb n="570"/>
 'one devoted to mental training,' is in
 Vis.M. the usual name for the disciple 
cultivating mental concentration (App.).

<xa>yokes</xa>
  yoga, q.v.

<xa>yoni</xa>
  'modes of generation.' There are 4 
generation from the egg, from the mother
's womb, from moisture, and spontaneous 
rebirth (opapa^tika, q.v.) in heaven, 
hell, etc. Explained in M. 12.

<xa>yoniso manasika^ra</xa>
 'thorough attention' or wise 
consideration': s. manasika^ra.

<xa>youth infatuation</xa>
 s. mada.

<xa>yuganaddha</xa>
  s. samatha-vipassana^, last paragraph.

<xa>Appendix</xa>
  
Attempt at a chronological fixing of 
terms not found, or not found in this 
form or meaning, in the oldest parts of 
the Sutta Pitaka.
<pb n="571"/>

<xa>akusala sa^dha^rana cetasika</xa>
 This term is probably used for the 
first time in Abh. S., though already in
 Vis.M. XIV the 4 cetasika in question 
are mentioned amongst the mental factors
 associated with each of the 12 akusala-
cittas (Tab. I, 22-33), while in the 
Abhidhamma Pitaka (Dhs. §§ 365-429) 
uddhacca is found only in the last of 
the 12 cittas, missing in all the 
remaining 11 cittas.

<xa>a^nantarika kamma</xa>
 This term seems to be used for the 
first time in Kath. (190) of the Abh. 
Canon; the 5 crimes mentioned, however, 
are already enumerated and explained in 
the old Sutta texts (e.g. A.V, 129), as 
is to be seen from the main part of this
 work.

<xa>a^rammana</xa>
  s. paccaya, 2.

<xa>avacara</xa>
  ka^ma^vacara is already met with in 
the oldest sutta texts (e.g. D. 1). Rúpa
^vacara and arúpa^vacara, however, occur
 probably for the first time in Pts.M. (
<pb n="572"/>
I. 83ff.), while in the Abhidhamma Canon
 and the Com. all the 3 terms are 
frequently mentioned and explained.

<xa>a^vajjana</xa>
  s. citta-vi^thi.

<xa>avya^kata</xa>
  This term in the sense of 'amoral' or 
'karmically neutral', does not occur in 
the old sutta texts, while it is found 
in Pts.M. (e.g. I, 79ff). It plays an 
important role in the Abh. Canon (e.g. 
Dhs.) and the philosophical commentaries
.

<xa>a^yúhana</xa>
  probably met with for the first time 
in Pts.M. (I . 10f.).

<xa>bhava</xa>
  The 2-fold division, kamma and 
upapatti, is probably found for the 
first time in Vibh. of the Abh. Canon, 
but it expresses throughout the genuine 
teaching of the suttas.

<xa>bha^va</xa>
  as an isolated word, signifying-the 
physical nature or faculties of sex, 
<pb n="573"/>
probably occurs only in the Com. The 
expression itthibha^va and purisabha^va,
 with the meaning of 'being a man', or '
being a woman', or after n~atva^, etc., 
as for instance tassa^ itthibha^vam n~
atva^: 'knowing her to be a woman': such
 expressions are often found in the 
oldest sutta texts.

<xa>bhavanga sota^,  citta</xa>
 These 2 compound terms belong 
exclusively to the exegetical literature
, while the term bhavanga is several 
times, briefly and unexplained, 
mentioned in the Patth. of the Abh. 
Canon, as though already known at that 
time.

<xa>carita</xa>
  ra^ga-c., dosa-c., buddhi-c., etc., 
are only to be met with in the Com. and 
Vis.M.

<xa>ca^ritta</xa>
  and va^ritta-sila: are only found in 
the Com., as Vis.M. 1, etc., but the 
teaching indicated by it is frequently 
mentioned in the old sutta texts as 
karani^ya and akarani^ya (e.g. A. II, 16
).
<pb n="574"/>

<xa>cetasika</xa>
  This term oceurs often in the old 
sutta texts, but only as adj. (e.g. 
cetasikam sukham, etc.) or, at times, 
used as a sing. neut. noun (e.g. D. 1; p
. 213, PTS). As a designation for mental
 factors, or concomitants of 
consciousness (citta-sampayutta^ dhamma^
), it is frequently met with in Dhs. (§ 
1189, 1512) as cetasika-dhamma, while in
 Vis.M., Abh. S., etc., cetasika is used
 also as a neuter noun, in the sense of 
mental phenomenon.

<xa>citta</xa>
 lahuta^, -mudúta, -kamman~n~ata^, -pa^
gun~n~ata^, -ujukata^: s. lahuta^.

<xa>citta</xa>
 vi^thi, as well as all terms for the 
various functions within the processes 
of conseiousness, such as a^vajjana-
citta, sampaticchana, santi^rana, 
votthapana, javana, tada^rammana, 
bhavanga, cuti: none of these terms is 
found in the Sutta Canon. except javana,
 in Pts.M. Even in the Ahh. Canon (e.g. 
Patth) only javana and bhavanga are 
twice or thrice briefly mentioned. The 
<pb n="575"/>
stages, however, must have been more or 
less known. Cf. e.g Patth: ''Cakkhu-vin~
n~a^nam tam sampayuttaka^ ca dhamma^ (= 
cetasika^) mano-dha^tuya^ (performing 
the sampaticchana-function), tam 
sampayuttaka^nan~ ca dhamma^nam (
cetasika^nani) anantara-paccayena 
paccayo. Mano-dha^tu ... manovin~n~a^na-
dha^tuya (performing the santi^rana and 
votthapana function).... Purima^ purima^
 kusala^ dhamma^ (javana^) pacchima^nam 
pacchima^nam kusala^nam dhamma^nam (
javanacitta^nam) anantara-paccayena 
paccayo... avya^kata^nam dhamma^nam (
tada^rammana- and bhavanga-citta^nam....
)."
cuti-citta: s. citta-vi^thi.

<xa>dha^tu vavattha^na</xa>
 This term is first used in Pts.M. while
 the subject in question is often 
treated in the old sutta texts (e.g. M. 
28, 62, 140, etc.). Cf. sammasana.

<xa>dhutanga</xa>
  This compound term is used only in the
 Com. The only place in the suttas where
 the first part, dhuta, is used in the 
above sense, is found in S. XIV. The 
names of the performers of these 13 
<pb n="576"/>
ascetical exercises, however, are all 
mentioned in the suttas, but scattered 
here and there, for instance: pamsukú
lika, a^ran~n~ika, pindapa^tika, eka^
sanika, teci^varika, sapa^da^naca^ri^, 
sosa^nika, abhhoka^sika, nesajjika, 
yatha^santhatika, in M. 5, 113; A. V, 
181-190, etc.; rukkhamúlika, khalupaccha
^bhattika and pattapindika in A. V, 189f
. etc.

<xa>gotrabhú</xa>
  s. javana.

<xa>hasituppa^da citta</xa>
 This term is used in Abh. S. for the 
citta, Tab. I, 72. This type of 
consciousness (the Buddha's smile) is 
often implied in the suttas.

<xa>iddhi</xa>
  Most, or perhaps all, of the 10 terms 
listed at Vis.M. XII, as adhittha^na, 
etc., are absent in the older sutta 
texts. In Pts.M. (II, 205-214), however,
 they are enumerated in due order and 
minutely explained. The magical powers 
indicated by these terms are, 
nevertheless, for the most part 
explicitly described already in the 
<pb n="577"/>
oldest sutta texts. Cf. D. 34; M. 3; A. 
III, 99, etc.

<xa>indriya samatta</xa>
 This term is probably found for the 
first time in the Com., esp. Vis.M. IV. 
The rudiments of this doctrine, however,
 are already found in the old sutta 
texts, e.g. A. III, 100.

<xa>javana</xa>
  The only reference in the Sutta Pitaka
 is Pts.M. II, 73: kusalakammassa javana
-khane, "in the impulsion-moment of a 
wholesome karma." In the Abhidhamma 
Pitaka it is briefly mentioned in the 
Pattha^na, but without explanation, as 
if already known. The teaching of the 
flashing forth of 4 javana immediately 
before entering the jha^na or lokuttara-
magga, i.e. parikamma, upaca^ra, anuloma
, gotrabhú is, as such, without doubt a 
later development in the commentarial 
literature.

<xa>kala^pa</xa>
  This doctrinal term, as well as the 
doctrine of the different corporeal 
units or groups, such as the 
suddhatthaka-k., ji^vitanavaka-k., 
<pb n="578"/>
cakkhudasaka-k., etc. (s. Vis.M. XVIII),
 belong only to the later developments 
of exegetical literature, as Vis.M. etc.

<xa>ka^ma</xa>
  Vatthu-k. and kilesa-k. are probably 
found for the first time in MNid. 1. 
They correspond to the pan~ca ka^maguna^
 (cakkhu-vin~n~eyya^ rúpa^, etc.) and ka
^ma-ra^ga in the older sutta texts (e.g 
A. VI, 68).

<xa>kamma</xa>
  ahosi-, janaka-, garuka-, bahula-, 
upatthambhaka-, upagha^taka-, upapi^laka
-, marana^sanna-, upacchedaka-k. None of
 these terms is found in the Sutta or 
Abh. Canon. They have been introduced by
 the commentators (e.g. in Abh. S. and 
Vis.M.) for the purpose of a 
systematical grouping of the various 
aspects and functions of karma. The term
 katatta^, however, occurs repeatedly in
 the Abh. Canon in such expressions as: 
'Yasmim samaye ... kusalassa kammassa 
katatta^ ... cakkhuvin~n~a^nam hoti....'
 (Dhs. § 431); or: 'Yam atthi rúpam 
kammassa katatta^ ....' (Dhs. § 653); or
 'katatta^ ca rúpa^nam' (Patth.), etc.

<pb n="579"/>
<xa>kamman~n~ata^</xa>
  s. lahuta^.

<xa>kammattha^na^</xa>
  This term, as a designation for the 
meditation exercises (bha^vana^), is 
found only in the Com. In the suttas the
 word is only used in a concrete sense 
for 'field of activity or occupation', 
as agriculture, trade, etc.

<xa>katatta^ kamma</xa>
 s. kamma.

<xa>ka^ya lahuta^</xa>
 -muduta^, -kamman~n~ata^, -pa^gun~n~ata
^, -ujukata^, s. lahuta^.

<xa>khana</xa>
  The 3 phases in a moment of 
consciousness, i.e. uppa^da, thiti, 
bhanga, are probably mentioned for the 
first time in the commentaries; but 
there is a close parallel in two sutta 
texts which may have been the source for
 that teaching of a three-phased moment 
of consciousness:
"There are 3 characteristics of what is 
conditioned (sankhatassa lakkhana^): an 
arising (uppa^do) is apparent, a passing
<pb n="580"/>
 away (vayo) is apparent, a change in 
the existing (thitassa an~n~athattam: 
Com. = ageing) is apparent" (A. III, 47)
. The same 3 phases are mentioned in S. 
XXII, 37, where they are applied to each
 of the 5 khandha.

<xa>kilesa</xa>
  the 10 kilesa are probably for the 
first time enumerated and explained in 
Dhs. (§§ 1229-1239). There they are, 
however, called kilesa-vatthu, which 
name (dasa kilesa-vatthu) is already 
mentioned in Pts I, 130, though there 
they are neither enumerated nor 
explained.

<xa>kiriya</xa>
  (kiriya^, kriya^) citta is a term 
first used in the Abh. Canon (e.g. Dhs. 
§§ 566-582). It has an important place 
in post-canonical Abh. literature, e.g. 
Vis.M. XIV.

<xa>lahuta^  muduta^, kamman~n~ata^</xa>
 as rúpassa-, ka^ya-, or citta-, are for
 the first time found in the Abh. Canon,
 esp. Dhs. All, however, perhaps with 
the sole exception of pagun~n~ata^, are 
implied in the Sutta Canon, e.g. 'citte 
<pb n="581"/>
mudu-bhúte kammani^ye' (M 4); 'lahu-san~
n~an~ ca ka^ye okkamitva^' (S. LI. 22); 
'cittam ujukam akamsu' (S. I. 26; PTS). 
Ka^ya-passaddhi and citta-passaddhi, 
however, are well known in the old sutta
 texts in this connection.

<xa>manodva^ra^vajjana</xa>
  s. citta-vi^thi.

<xa>muduta^</xa>
  s. lahuta^.

<xa>n~a^na</xa>
  Of the 9 kinds of insight-knowledge 
constituting the patipada^-n~a^nadassana
-visuddhi (s. Vis.M. XXI), the following
 6 are, as such, enumerated and 
explained for the first time in Pts.M., 
namely: udayabbaya^nupassana^-n~a^na (I.
 54-57), bhanga^nupassana^-n~a^na, (ib. 
57f.). bhayatupattha^na-n~a^na (ib. 59f)
. muccitukamyata^-n~a^na, patisanka^-n~a
^na, sankha^rupekkha^-n~a^na (ib. 60-65)
. The terms udayabbaya and bhanga, in 
connection with the 5 groups of 
existence, however, are often met with 
in the old sutta texts. Of the remaining
 3 kinds of knowledge, a^di^nava^
nupassana^, nibbida^nupassana^ and 
<pb n="582"/>
anuloman~a^na, the first 2 occur often 
in the old sutta texts, while anuloma-n~
a^na, though only briefly mentioned in 
the Abh. Canon (Patth.), plays a 
prominent part in the exegetical 
literature.

<xa>natthi paccaya</xa>
 s. paccaya.

<xa>n'eva sekha n'a^sekha</xa>
 While the terms sekha and asekha occur 
frequently in the old sutta texts (e.g. 
A. II, 4: 'sekho ca asekho ca imasmim 
loke... a^huneyya^' etc.), the term n'
eva-sekha-n'a^sekha is perhaps mentioned
 for the first time in Pug. of the Abh. 
Canon.

<xa>nibba^na</xa>
  The 2 terms kilesa- and khandha-
parinibba^na (or nibba^na) are found 
only in the Com.; their corresponding 2 
aspects sa-upa^disesa and anupa^disesa-
nibba^na, however, are mentioned and 
explained in It. 44 of the Sutta Canon.

<xa>nimitta</xa>
  As signifying the mental reflex-image 
occurring in meditation, this term, 
<pb n="583"/>
singly or in compounds (parikkamma-, 
uggaha-, patibha^ga-n.), is found only 
in the Com., Vis.M., etc. The same holds
 good for kamma-nimitta, gati-nimitta.

<xa>nissarana paha^na</xa>
 s. paha^na.

<xa>nissaya  nissita</xa>
 These two terms, in combination with 
tanha^ and ditthi, belong probably, as 
such, to the commentarial literature, e.
g. Vis.M. I.

<xa>niya^ma</xa>
  The compound words utu-, bi^ja-, kamma
-, citta-, and dhamma-niya^ma, probably 
occur for the first time in the Com. 
Niya^mata^, however, occurs often in the
 old sutta texts, e.g. 'thita^ va sa^ 
dha^tu dhammatthitata^ dhammaniya^mata..
.' (A. III. 134. etc.)

<xa>niyata miccha^ditthi</xa>
 is apparently mentioned for the first 
time in Dhs. (e.g. § 1028) of the Abh. 
As a name for the 10th and last of the 
akusala-kammapathas, it plays a 
prominent role in the Com.

<pb n="584"/>
<xa>paccaya</xa>
  This term occurs often in the old 
sutta texts in such expressions as: 'ko 
hetu, ko paccayo', 'yam yad eva paccayam
 paticca uppajjati vin~n~a^nam', etc., 
or as abl. adverb in 'avijja^paccaya^ 
sankha^ra^'. All the 24 paccaya are for 
the first time enumerated, explained and
 applied to the phenomena of existence 
in the Abh. Canon (Patth). Of these 24 
paccaya, 5 are already mentioned in Pts.
M. (II, 49-54, 59f., 72-77), namely, 
sahaja^ta-, an~n~aman~n~a-, nissaya-, 
sampayutta-, vippayutta-paccaya.
1. Hetu is already used in the sutta 
texts as 'condition' in a general and 
indefinite way, as a synonym of paccaya.
 In the sense of kusala and akusala 
roots (múla; s. M. 9), however, it is 
only found in the Abh. Canon and Com.
2. a^rammana has in the 'sutta texts 
only the meaning of 'foundation', or '
basis', or 'dependent on', e.g. M. 21: '
tada^rammanan~ca sabbalokam metta^
sahagatena cetasa^ pharitva^....' or D.
33; S.XXII.53: 'vin~n~a^nam ... rúpa^
rammanam ... vedana^ram-manam....' As 
term for the 6 objects, rúpa^rammana, 
sadda^rammana, etc.,
it is first used in the Abh. Canon, 
<pb n="585"/>
though the teaching of dependency of the
 6 kinds of vin~n~a^na on the 6 sense-
objects is an integral part of the 
suttas. Cf. e.g. M.38: 'cakkhun~ca 
paticca rúpe ca uppajjati vin~n~a^nam 
sotan~ca paticca sadde ca ...' etc.
3. Adhipati, as a philosophical term, 
occurs for the first time in the Abh. 
Canon (esp. Patth.). The 4 adhipati are 
in the suttas called iddhipa^da (e.g. S.
 LI. 11). In the old sutta texts, 3 
adhipateyya are however mentioned: atta-
, loka-, dhamma- (A. III, 38).
4. ＆ 5. Anantara- and samanantara-
paccaya occur, as paccaya, for the first
 time in the Abh. Canon (esp. Patth.). 
In a veiled form, however, we find the 
first term in the old sutta texts (e.g. 
Ratana Sutta in Khp. and Sn.): 'sama^
dhim a^nantarikan~n~ama^hu': the 
concentration (associated with the 
arahatta-magga), which is called the '
immediate' condition (for arahatta-phala
).
6. ＆ 7. Sahaja^ta and an~n~aman~n~a-
paccaya. Though these terms, as such, 
are not found in the older sutta texts, 
still the teaching of the conascent and 
mutual conditionedness of the 4 mental 
groups (vedana^, san~n~a^, sankha^ra, 
<pb n="586"/>
vin~n~a^na) is taught in the old texts, 
e.g. M. 28, 43; S. XXII, etc.
8. Nissaya-paccaya is mentioned in Pts; 
s. first paragraph of this article, 
above.
9. Upanissaya-paccaya. Though this name 
is not found in the suttas, the teaching
 expressed thereby is, however, 
frequently met with there, sometimes 
even in the form of upanisa^ (apparently
 a contraction of upanissaya), e.g. S. 
XII, 23: 'Yam pi'ssa tam bhikkhave 
khayasmim khaye n~a^nam, tam sa-upanisam
 vada^mi, no anupanisam '. The terms 
pakati-, a^rammana- and anantara-
upanissaya are later developments of the
 Abh. Com.
All the remaining terms are met with 
only in the Abh. literature though the 
substance is, perhaps in all cases, 
already dealt with in the old sutta 
texts.

<xa>pa^daka jjha^na</xa>
 This term is not found in the Sutta 
Canon, nor apparently in the Abh. Canon,
 but very often used in the exegetical 
literature. The idea, however, expressed
 thereby, is implied in many places of 
the old sutta texts, e.g., A. IX, 36, 
<pb n="587"/>
where it is shown how the jha^nas, one 
after the other, may serve as basis, or 
foundation (as mental object), for 
vipassana^. In many of the old sutta 
texts it is also shown how the 4th jha^
na forms the foundation for the 
attainment of the 5 higher spiritual 
powers (abhin~n~a^).

<xa>pa^gun~n~ata^</xa>
  s. lahuta^.

<xa>paha^na</xa>
  The 5 terms, as vikkhambhana, etc., 
are, as such, not found in the old sutta
 texts, but they are enumerated and 
explained already in Pts.M. (II. 179f.).

<xa>palibodha</xa>
  This 10-fold group is perhaps for the 
first time mentioned in Khp. Com. and 
explained in Vis.M. III.

<xa>pan~ca dva^ra^vajjana</xa>
 s. a^vajjana.

<xa>paramattha</xa>
 s. voha^ra-desana^.

<xa>pa^rami^  pa^ramita^</xa>
<pb n="588"/>
 Only the Com. deals with this subject, 
apart from the 3 apocryphal works, 
Buddhavamsa and Cariyapitaka, and the Ja
^taka.

<xa>paricchinna^ka^sa</xa>
  This term is used in the Com. for the 
term a^ka^sa-kasina used in the older 
sutta texts.

<xa>parin~n~a^</xa>
  n~a^ta-, ti^rana-, paha^na-p., belong 
to the exegetical literature, but they 
are already implied in Pts.M. I. 87: '
Abhin~n~a^-pan~n~a^ n~a^tatthe n~a^nam, 
parin~n~a^-pan~n~a^ ti^ranatthe n~a^nam,
 paha^na-pan~n~a^ paricca^gatthe n~a^nam
 ... ye ye dhamma^ abhin~n~a^ta^ honti, 
te te dhamma^ n~a^ta honti ... ti^rita^ 
... pahi^na^.'

<xa>pariyatti  patipatti, pativedha</xa>
 The first of these 3 fundamental terms,
 especially in this 3-fold grouping, 
belongs to the commentarial literature, 
though the idea expressed thereby is 
often found in the suttas in such 
expressions as: 'dhammam pariya^puna^ti 
suttam geyyam veyya^karanam ....' The 2 
other terms are found separately in the 
<pb n="589"/>
suttas.

<xa>patipannaka</xa>
  occurs in Pug. 17.

<xa>patipatti</xa>
  s. pariyatti.

<xa>patisandhi</xa>
  is chiefly a commentarial term; but it
 occurs several times in one of the 
later books of the Sutta Pitaka, the 
Patisambhida^ Magga (Pts.M. I, 11f, 52, 
59f.; II, 72f.). The usual sutta term 
for 'rebirth' is punabbhava.

<xa>patisandhika</xa>
  ahetu-, dvihetu-, and tihetu-p.: are 
purely commentarial terms. For 
patisandhi-citta, s. citta-vi^thi.

<xa>pativedha</xa>
  s. pariyatti.

<xa>pattida^na</xa>
  This term is found only in the Com., 
but the belief expressed by it is 
several times mentioned in the older 
sutta texts. Cf. the main part of this 
work.
<pb n="590"/>

<xa>rúpa</xa>
  the terms nipphanna-rúpa and rúpa-rúpa
 are used only in the Com., although 
sappatigha and pasa^da are already found
 in the Abh. Canon (e.g. Dhs. §§ 585, 
597f.), while upa^dinna occurs 
repeatedly in the old sutta texts, e.g. 
M. 28, apparently with the meaning given
 in the main part of this work. Cf. 
further upa^da^-rúpa.

<xa>sama^dhi</xa>
  parikamma-, upaca^ra-, and appana^-s.:
 are found only in the Com.

<xa>sama si^si^</xa>
 This term seems to be met with for the 
first time in Pug. 19, while the person 
indicated is described in A., as is to 
be seen in the main part of this work.

<xa>samatha ya^nika</xa>
 s. sukkha-vipassaka.

<xa>sammasana</xa>
  This term, as noun, occurs probably 
for the first time in Pts.M. I. 53, 
although as a verb it is found already 
in the old texts. The same holds good 
<pb n="591"/>
with its synonym vavattha^na.

<xa>sammuti</xa>
  s. sacca.

<xa>sampaticchana citta</xa>
 s. citta-vi^thi.

<xa>samuttha^na</xa>
  kamma- (= kamma-ja), utu-, a^ha^ra-s.:
 these terms are found only in the Com. 
Citta-samuttha^na-rúpa, however, occurs 
already in Dhs. (§ 586) of the Abh. 
Canon; and is indicated very often in 
Patth., e.g. 'tam (cittam) samuttha^na^
nan~ ca rúpa^nam'. The teaching of the 
origin of matter is, of course, already 
implied in the old sutta texts.

<xa>santa^na  santati</xa>
 The terms citta-, rúpa-, khandha-, 
bhavanga-s.:, etc., are found, here and 
there, in the Abh. Canon (e.g. Dhs. § 
634, Kath. 110; s. Guide V), but they 
are often met with in the Abh. Com. In 
the Sutta (Therag. 716) is found sankha^
rasantati.

<xa>santi^rana citta</xa>
 s. citta-vi^thi.
<pb n="592"/>

<xa>si^la</xa>
  paccayasannissita-, pacca^vekkhana-si^
la:, etc., are terms used in the Com. 
for the proper contemplation (patisankha
^ yoniso) of the 4 requisites of a monk,
 often dealt with in the old texts (e.g.
 M. 2). Also the 3 other pa^risuddhi-si^
la, as pa^timokkhasamvara-, indriya-, 
and a^ji^vapa^risuddhi-si^la, though 
under these names perhaps only known in 
the Com., are fully dealt with in the 
old texts, e.g. M.53, D.2, M.2, etc. The
 terms pannatti- and pan~n~atti-si^la 
are used only in the Com.

<xa>sukkha</xa>
 vipassaka = suddha-vipassana^-ya^nika: 
these terms are used only in the Com., 
as also their counterpart samathaya^nika
.

<xa>tada^rammana citta</xa>
 s. citta-vi^thi.

<xa>tathata^</xa>
  This term, with the meaning in 
question, occurs perhaps only once in 
the Canon, namely in Kath. (s. Guide 83)
. Whether it is found also somewhere in 
<pb n="593"/>
the Com. , I am unable to say.

<xa>tatramajjhattata^</xa>
  occurs probably for the first time in 
the Abh. Canon (e.g. Patth.; cf. Guide 
110).

<xa>therava^da</xa>
  This term was already used by the 
Buddha himself in speaking of the 
doctrine of a^la^ra-Ka^la^ma (s. M. 26).
 As a name for the Buddha's doctrine it 
belongs to the commentarial literature.

<xa>ujukata^</xa>
  s. lahuta^.

<xa>upacaya</xa>
  is an Abh. term but already alluded to
 in the old sutta texts, e.g. M. 149: 'a
^yatim pan~cúpa^da^nakkhandha^ upacayam 
gacchanti', or in D.2: 'Ayam ka^yo ... 
odana-kumma^s' upacayo'.

<xa>upa^da^ rúpa</xa>
 is, as such, an Abh. term, but it is 
used with the same meaning in the sutta 
texts, c.g. in M. 9: 'catunnan~ ca maha^
bhúta^nam upa^da^yn rúpam'. Upa^da^ is 
an abbreviation of upa^da^ya (gerund).

<xa>va^ritta si^la</xa>
 s. ca^ritta.

<xa>vasi^</xa>
  The 5 kinds of vasi^ are probably 
found first in the Vis.M.

<xa>vatthu</xa>
  as a general term for the 5 sense-
organs (cakkhu-vatthu, etc ) is frequent
 in the Com., and often used together 
with a^rammana (object). This usage, 
however, is already indicated in the Abh
. Canon: 'Cakkhum p'etam... vatthum p'
etam' (Dhs. § 597; Vibh., p.71, PTS): '
cakkhuvin~n~a^nassa vatthu' (Dhs. §§ 
679ff.).

<xa>vimokkha</xa>
  The 3, i.e. sun~n~ata^-, animitta-, 
appanihita-: are for the first time 
described and enumerated in Pts.M. II, 
351. As sun~n~ata^sama^dhi, etc., 
however, they are already given at D. 33
.

<xa>vin~n~atti</xa>
  ka^ya- and vaci^-v., seem to occur for
 the first time in Dhs. (§§ 665,718) of 
<pb n="595"/>
the Abh. Canon.

<xa>vipassana^</xa>
  is frequently found in the older sutta
 texts (e.g. A. II, 32; S. XLV, 159), 
also together with samatha. The 9 and 18
 insight-knowledges (vipassana^-n~a^na 
and maha^-vipassana^), however, occur in
 the Sutta Pitaka only in the Pts.M., n~
a^nakatha^, where they are enumerated 
and explained, though without any group 
name being attached to them.

<xa>vipassanúpakkilesa</xa>
  The group of 10 is mentioned for the 
first time in Pts.M. II, 102, and it is 
said that the mind may become defiled 
thereby (kilissati), but the above term 
is not used for the 10. This is probably
 done for the first time in Vis.M. XX.

<xa>vivatta</xa>
  as a name for Nibba^na, seems to be 
found only in the Com.

<xa>vivattana^nupassana^</xa>
  is already mentioned in Pts.M., 
together with the remaining 17 kinds of 
vipassana^. In the old texts it is not 
found.
<pb n="596"/>

<xa>voha^ra sacca</xa>
 etc. The terms paramattha-, voha^ra-, 
sammuti-: etc., belong as such to the 
commentarial literature, but their 
significance is clearly shown in the old
 sutta texts, e.g. D. 9: 'loka-sa^man~n~
a^, loka-voha^ra'; further(D 33): '
sammuti-n~a^na', etc.

<xa>voka^ra</xa>
  pan~ca-, catu-, and eka-v. (bhava), 
occur as technical terms only in the Abh
. (Vibh., Yam., Patth.) and Com., e.g. 
Vis.M., but their substance is an 
integral part of the suttas.

<xa>votthapana citta</xa>
 s. citta-vi^thi.

<xa>vuttha^na ga^mini^ vipassana^</xa>
 is probably implied in Pts.M. I, 60, 
under the name of vuttha^na-vivattane n~
a^na.

<xa>yamaka pa^tiha^riya</xa>
 is perhaps for the first time mentioned
 and described in Pts.M., as seen in the
 main part of this work.

<pb n="597"/>
<xa>yoga^vacara  yogi</xa>
 These 2 terms belong to the 
commentarial literature, but the first 
term appears also in Mil.
