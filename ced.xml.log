Preface to the Digital Edition

Why Digitize Soothill?

Like all other graduate students for the
past generation or so who chose to

embark on a professional career in the
study of East Asian Buddhism, I was, in

my early days of study, strictly warned by
my mentors against relying on the Soothill and Hodous' Dictionary of Chinese
Buddhist Terms as a primary research tool. There were two main reasons for
this. First, the dictionary is an extremely dated work, having reached
completion during the mid 1930's, several decades before a serious profession
of Buddhology had formed itself in the West.

Western language information on Buddhism
available to its compilers was extremely limited, and even in East Asian
languages there were few reliable and comprehensive lexicons available. Thus
the understanding of the philosophical terminology coming out of such systems
as Mādhyamika and Yogācāra—which had only barely come to be understood in the
West, tended to be simplistic, if not completely erroneous. It was a time in
the history of the discipline when "Hīnayāna" was still considered to
be something of a distinct historical Buddhist tradition. Beyond this, even
concepts contained in the dictionary that were adequately understood were often
expressed in archaic terms.

The second reason for pushing graduate
<pb n="3"/>
students away from this work is related to the necessity of getting them
involved as quickly as possible in dealing with resources from the original
Asian traditions—in this case, the original texts and secondary resources from
China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Beyond this, the constraints imposed by the
printing technology of the 1930's have always made the dictionary somewhat
difficult to use, with many of the entries in the dictionary being embedded
inside other entries. There is also the difficulty brought about by the usage of
vertical bars to indicate the repetition of Chinese characters. There is also
somewhat of a dearth of useful indexing.

Despite these shortcomings, the fact is
that just about every serious scholar of East Asian Buddhism has a copy of the
Soothill/Hodous dictionary in her/his personal library (perhaps stashed
somewhere next to a copy of Mathews). This is an indication of an important
fact about the dictionary: there is a large amount of information contained
within it that can't readily be found elsewhere. Most notably information on
Indian and Central Asian place names, personal names, temple names and so
forth, but also lots of information on hybrid Sanskrit and transliterations
that one will not find in any other dictionary, East Asian or otherwise.

I made the decision to digitize the
dictionary upon finding out that it had fallen into the public domain, coupled
with the realization that its content could do much to supplement that of my
own long-term Buddhist lexicographical project, the Digital Dictionary of
Buddhism [DDB (http://www.acmuller.net/ddb)].

Obtaining a grant from the Japan Society
for the Promotion of Science [JSPS] I

spent, along with a number of assistants,
<pb n="4"/>
two years in the task of digitizing this material and adding it to the DDB.

I became, in the process of this task,
quite likely the only other person besides Soothill, Hodous, and their
editorial staff, to read the dictionary in its entirety, and as a result of
this concentrated exposure to it, I was led, as a fellow lexicographer, to come
away with an immense respect for efforts of its compilers. Very early in the
age of attempts at mixed Chinese-Roman typesetting, and several decades before
the advent of copy machines, these two men, working on different continents,
sent their handwritten manuscript back and forth by ship over the Atlantic
ocean no less than four times.

Serious scrutiny has led me to the
conclusion that the work is, at least in terms of its translations from Chinese
sources, fairly sound. Using modern computing technology in the process of
adding this material to the DDB, we were able to benefit from the presence of
digitized versions of the Fanyi mingyi ji and the Ding Fubao, which were
checked (along with a wide range of other digitized resources) on the addition
of each entry. This allowed us to add a good amount of information to the DDB
from these sources that Soothill and Hodous—no doubt in the interest of
economy—left out. This also allowed us to see clearly that both men held a very
solid command of classical Chinese. Their renderings from these sources are
accurate, insightful, and nuanced. They also extensively and painstakingly
consulted the other reference works that were available to them at the time,
such as the lexicons by Eitel and Monier-Williams (see Soothill's Preface for a
discussion of sources). Making extensive use of Eitel, they were able to add a
sizeable amount of geographical location information for place names contained
in the various travel records of Chinese monks who went to India and Central
Asia.

<pb n="5"/>
As noted above, the most obvious area of
difficulty in terms of content was that

concerned with Buddhist philosophy. They
were not aware at all of the complex

nature of the relationship between the
"Paramarthan" and Xuanzang Yogācāra (the

"schools of Idealism"), but more
telling (and historically, interesting) is the

fact that they had not yet even
sufficiently grasped the distinctions between

Yogācāra and Vajrayāna, as these two
traditions are conflated in a number of

places. Also, not surprising for the time
period in which they worked and their

backgrounds, much of their thinking was
informed by Christian theology, and this

is sometimes reflected in their renderings
of Buddhist concepts. On the other

hand, since Soothill was one the early
translators of the Lotus Sutra, it is not

<pb n="6"/>
surprising to note that there is a strong
presence of Lotus and Tiantai related

terminology in this work, most of it
rendered with sufficient accuracy.

Status of the Digital Document and
Treatment of its Contents

I started this project with only the intent
of absorbing its data into the DDB

in a supplementary fashion, and it was not
until halfway through the process of

digitization that it occurred to me that a
separate digital version of the

dictionary made publicly available on the
internet could be of sufficient value

to merit paying attention to the proper
preservation of its original format.

Thus, unfortunately, during the early
stages, almost all attention was paid to

devising the most efficient strategies for
preparation of the material for entry

<pb n="7"/>
into the DDB. This preparation included the
changing of Chinese transliterations into Pinyin, as well as correction of
Sanskrit diacritics, and amendments in diacritical style according to the
modern norms used the DDB. However, even this was not done with consistency, as
sometimes these changes were made in the Dictionary source files, and sometimes
only after they had been added to the DDB.

The major format change one will see in
this version is that of the places where Soothill/Hodous had included numerous
entries under a single entry heading. For ready absorption into the DDB using
computer programming, these were broken down into separate entries. As it turns
out, it makes the dictionary much more readable, so I don't see that this will
be a problem. Also, our replacement of the vertical bars with the actual Han
characters they were used to indicate will make for much easier reading than in
the printed original.

Most corrections to the material are
usually only found in the equivalent DDB

entry. Since we have already gone through
the correcting and editing process

once while adding the material to the DDB,
it does not seem worth it, for our

purposes, to go back and try to return to
Soothill material to its precise

original format. But if someone would like
to do that job, they are certainly
<pb n="8"/>

welcome to do so. There is little doubt
that the addition of the material to the

DDB in a more readily accessible, searchable
format is something that Profs.

Soothill and Hodous would have themselves
happily welcomed. Prof. Soothill's

attitude toward the usage of his work in
future projects is well expressed as

follows:


Lack of time and funds has prevented our studying the Canon, especially


historically, or engaging a staff of competent Chinese Buddhist scholars
to


study it for the purpose. We are consequently all too well aware that
the


Dictionary is not as perfect or complete as it might be.


<pb n="9"/>
Nevertheless, it seems better to encourage the study of Chinese Buddhism
as


early as possible by the provision of a working dictionary rather than
delay


the publication perhaps for years, until our ideals are satisfied—a
condition


which might never be attained.


We therefore issue this Compendium—for it is in reality more than a


Dictionary—in the hope that many will be stimulated to devote time to a


subject which presents so fascinating a study in the development of
religion.

The basic digital document is structured in
XML, using the recommendations for

print dictionaries provided by the Text
Encoding Initiative [TEI]. This will

<pb n="10"/>
allow for its transformation into various
formats for implementation on the Web,

and elsewhere. While the major portion of the
work of development of the

structure in the usage of TEI2 was done by
Charles Muller, a significant

housecleaning of this structure was done by
Michael Beddow in the process of

final production. The XSLT transformation
was done based on the TEI style sheets

developed by Sebastian Rahtz.

Acknowledgments

The work of digitizing A Dictionary of
Chinese Buddhist Terms was made possible

by a research grant from the Japan Society
for the Promotion of Science. The

scanning and OCR work was done in its entirety
by Yasuko Suzuki. Ms. Suzuki also

did almost all of the editing and
correction of Chinese characters contained in
<pb n="11"/>

the text. Proofreading of the English text,
and especially the insertion of

diacritical marks was done by Heather
Blair, Juhn Ahn, Amanda Goodman, Gina

Cogan, James Mark Shields, and Thomas
Dreitlein. Please note that due to certain

processes of the project, not all of these
corrections appear in the present

text, but are reflected in their entirety
within the Digital Dictionary of

Buddhism.

PROFESSOR SOOTHILL'S PREFACE

AS compilers of the first Dictionary of
Chinese Mahāyāna Terms, we are far from

considering our attempt as final. Our
<pb n="12"/>
desire has been to provide a key for the

student with which to unlock a closed door.
If it serves to reveal the riches of

the great Buddhist thesaurus in China, we
will gladly leave to others the

correction and perfecting of our
instrument. It was Dr. E. J. Eitel, of The

London Missionary Society, who over sixty
years ago, in 1870, provided the first

means in English of studying Chinese
Buddhist texts by his Handbook for the

Student of Chinese Buddhism. It has been of
great service; but it did not deal

with Chinese Buddhist terminology in
general. In form it was

Sanskrit-Chinese-English, and the second
edition unhappily omitted the

Chinese-Sanskrit Index which was essential
for the student reading the Chinese

Sutras. [Note:
<pb n="13"/>

1. A reprint of the second edition,
incorporating a Chinese Index, was published

in Japan in 1904, but is very scarce.]

Lacking a dictionary of Chinese Buddhist
terms, it was small wonder that the

translation of Chinese texts has made
little progress, important though these

are to the understanding of Mahāyāna
Buddhism, especially in its Far Eastern

development. Two main difficulties present
themselves: first of all, the special

and peculiar use of numerous ordinary
Chinese terms; and, secondly, the large

number of transliterated phrases.

In regard to the first difficulty, those
who have endeavoured to read Chinese

texts apart from the apprehension of a
Sanskrit background have generally made a

fallacious interpretation, for the Buddhist
<pb n="14"/>
canon is basically translation, or

analogous to translation. In consequence, a
large number of terms existing are

employed approximately to connote imported
ideas, as the various Chinese

translators understood those ideas. Various
translators invented different

terms; and, even when the same term was
finally adopted, its connotation varied,

sometimes widely, from the Chinese term or
phrase as normally used by the

Chinese. For instance, kleśa undoubtedly
has a meaning in Sanskrit similar to

that of 煩惱, i. e. affliction, distress, trouble.

In Buddhism affliction (or, as it may be
understood from Chinese, the

afflicters, distressers, troublers) means
the passions and illusions; and

consequently fan-nao in Buddhist
phraseology has acquired this technical
<pb n="15"/>

connotation of the passions and illusions.
Many terms of a similar character

will be noted in the body of this work.

Consequent partly on this use of ordinary
terms, even a well-educated Chinese

without a knowledge of the technical
equivalents finds himself unable to

understand their implications.

A difficulty equally serious is the
transliteration of Sanskrit, a difficulty

rendered far greater by the varied versions
of many translators. Take, for

instance, the word "Buddha" and
its transliteration as 佛; 佛陀; 浮陀, 浮圖, 浮頭, 勃陀, 勃馱, 部陀, 母陀, 沒馱, and so on. The pages of the Chinese canon are peppered with such

transliterations as these from the
Sanskrit, in regrettable variety. The

position resembles that of Chinese
terminology in Modern Science, which was

often transliteration twenty or thirty
<pb n="16"/>
years ago, when I drew the attention of

the Board of Education in Peking to the
need of a regulated terminology for

Science. Similarly, in pages devoid of
capitals, quotation-marks, or

punctuation, transliterated
Sanskrit-into-Chinese may well seem to the

uninitiated, whether Chinese or foreign, to
be ordinary phrases out of which no

meaning can be drawn.

Convinced, therefore, that until an
adequate dictionary was in existence, the

study of Far Eastern Buddhist texts could
make little progress amongst foreign

students in China, I began the formation of
such a work. In 1921 I discovered in

Bodley's Library, Oxford, an excellent
version of the 翻譯名義 集 Fan I ming I
Chi,

i.e. Translation of Terms and Meanings,
<pb n="17"/>
composed by 法雲 Fa-yin, circa the tenth

century A.D. At the head of each entry in
the volume I examined, some one, I

know not whom, had written the Sanskrit
equivalent in Sanskrit letters. These

terms were at once added to my own card
index. Unhappily the writer had desisted

from his charitable work at the end of the
third volume, and the remaining seven

volumes I had laboriously to decipher with
the aid of Stanislas Julien's M thode

pour d chiffrer et transcrire les noms
sanscrits qui se rencontrent dans les

livres chinois, 1861, and various
dictionaries, notably that of Monier Williams.

Not then possessed of the first edition of
Eitel's Handbook, I also perforce

made an index of the whole of his book.
Later there came to my knowledge the

admirable work of the Japanese 織田得能 Oda Tokunō
<pb n="18"/>
in his 佛教大辭典; and also the Chinese version based upon it of 丁福保 Ding
Fubao, called the 佛學大辭典 in sixteen volumes; also the 佛學小辭典 in one volume. Apart from these, it would have been difficult for
Dr. Hodous and myself to have collaborated in the production of this work.
Other dictionaries and vocabularies have since appeared, not least the first
three fascicules of the H b girin, the Japanese-Sanskrit-French Dictionary of
Buddhism.

When my work had made considerable
progress, Dr. Y. Y. Tsu called upon me and in

the course of conversation mentioned that
Dr. Hodous, of Hartford Theological

Seminary, Connecticut, U.S.A., who had
spent many years in South China and

studied its religions, was also engaged on
a Buddhist Dictionary. After some

delay and correspondence, an arrangement
was made by which the work was divided

between us, the final editing and
publishing being allotted to me. Lack of time

and funds has prevented our studying the
Canon, especially historically, or

engaging a staff of competent Chinese
Buddhist scholars to study it for the
<pb n="19"/>

purpose. We are consequently all too well
aware that the Dictionary is not as

perfect or complete as it might be.

Nevertheless, it seems better to encourage
the study of Chinese Buddhism as

early as possible by the provision of a
working dictionary rather than delay the

publication perhaps for years, until our
ideals are satisfied—a condition which

might never be attained.

We therefore issue this Compendium—for it
is in reality more than a

Dictionary—in the hope that many will be
stimulated to devote time to a subject

which presents so fascinating a study in
the development of religion.

My colleague and collaborator, Dr. Hodous,
took an invaluable share in the draft

of this work, and since its completion has carefully
<pb n="20"/>
read over the whole of the

typed pages. It may, therefore, be
considered as the common work of both of us,

for which we accept a common
responsibility. It seemed scarcely possible for two

men living outside China, separated by
2,000 miles of ocean, and with different

mentalities and forms of expression, to
work together to a successful

conclusion. The risky experiment was
hesitatingly undertaken on both sides, but

we have been altogether happy in our mutual
relations.

To Dr. F.W. Thomas, Boden Professor of
Sanskrit, Oxford University, I am deeply

indebted for his great kindness in checking
the Sanskrit terminology. He is in

no way responsible for the translation from
the Chinese; but his comments have

led to certain corrections, and his help in
<pb n="21"/>
the revision of the proper spelling

of the Sanskrit words has been of very
great importance. In the midst of a busy

life, he has spared time, at much
sacrifice, to consider the Sanskrit phrases

throughout the entire work, except certain
additional words that have since come

to my notice. As an outstanding authority,
not only on the Sanskrit language,

but on Tibetan Buddhism and the Tibetan
language, his aid has been doubly

welcome. Similarly, Dr. Hodous wishes
specially to thank, his colleague at

Trinity College, Hartford, Conn., Dr. LeRoy
Carr Barret, for the generous

assistance he rendered in revising the
Sanskrit terms in his section of our

joint work, and for his well-considered and
acceptable comments and suggestions.

Dr. Lionel Giles, Keeper of the Department
<pb n="22"/>
of Oriental Printed Books and MSS.,

British Museum, illustrious son of an
illustrious parent, has also our special

appreciation, for he magnanimously
undertook to read the proofs. He brings his

own ripe scholarship and experienced
judgment to this long labour; and the value

and precision of the Dictionary will
undoubtedly be enhanced through his

accurate and friendly supervision.

Next, we would most gratefully acknowledge
the gift of Mrs. Paul de Witt Twinem,

of Trenton, New Jersey, U.S.A. She has
subscribed a sum of money which has made

the publication of our work possible. To
this must be added further aid in a

very welcome subvention from the Prize
Publication Fund of the Royal Asiatic

Society. Such a practical expression of
encouragement by fellow-orientalists is
<pb n="23"/>

a matter of particular gratification.

Our thanks are due to Mr. Zu-liang Yih 葉樹梁, who with
accuracy, zeal, and

faithfulness has written the large number
of Chinese characters needed. To the

Hon. Mrs. Wood I am grateful for help in
the exacting task of transcribing. As

to my daughter, Lady Hosie, I have no words
to express my personal indebtedness

to her. Without her loving and unflagging
aid as amanuensis, I should have been

unable to finish my part in this work,
which-so the authors hope-will once again

demonstrate the implicit and universal need
of the human spirit for religion,

and its aspirations towards the Light that
"lighteth every man that cometh into

the world".

PROFESSOR HODOUS'S PREFACE

After the Dictionary went to press,
Professor Soothill died. The work on the

Dictionary, however, was completed. For ten
years we worked together, he at

Oxford and I at Hartford, and the
manuscript crossed the Atlantic four times.

During his semester in New York as Visiting
Professor in Columbia University and

on my brief visit to Oxford, we had
opportunity to consult together on some

outstanding problems. The work of
organizing the material and harmonizing the

differences was done by Professor Soothill.
He was well equipped to undertake

the task of producing a Buddhist
Dictionary, having a thorough knowledge of the
<pb n="25"/>

Chinese language. His Pocket Chinese
Dictionary is still in use. He knew Chinese

culture and religion. He possessed a keen
sense for the significant and a rare

ability to translate abstruse terms into
terse English. But even more valuable

was his profound insight into and deep
sympathy with the religious life and

thought of another people.

The text and the indexes were again finally
revised during his last long illness

by Lady Hosie under his supervision. He was
able also to appreciate the kind

collaboration of Dr. Lionel Giles on the
earlier proof-sheets. But his death

meant a vastly increased amount of work for
Dr. Giles who, on the other side of

the Atlantic from myself, has had to assume
a responsibility quite unexpected by

<pb n="26"/>
himself and by us. For two to three years,
with unfailing courtesy and patience,

he has considered and corrected the very
trying pages of the proofs, while the

Dictionary was being printed. He gave
chivalrously of his long knowledge both of

Buddhism and of the Chinese literary
characters. He adds yet another laurel to

the cause of Chinese learning and research.
And in the same way Professor F.W.

Thomas bore the brunt of the Sanskrit
proof-reading. We have indeed been

fortunate to have had our work checked in
extenso by such exacting scholars.

To Sir E. Denison Ross, who kindly looked
over the proofs, and added certain

welcome corrections, our thanks are due.
Also we would wish to acknowledge the

help of Mr. L. M. Chefdeville, who, putting
his experience of various Oriental

<pb n="27"/>
languages at our disposal, made many
helpful suggestions, especially as regards

the Indexes. Nor do we forget the fidelity
and careful work of the printers,

Messrs. Stephen Austin and Sons, who
collaborated with us in every way in our

desire to produce a volume a little worthy
of its notable subject.

Our object is well expressed by my late
colleague. The difficulties in the

production of the book were not small.
Buddhism has a long history. Its concepts

were impregnated by different cultures, and
expressed in different languages.

For about a thousand years

Buddhism dominated the thought of China,
and her first-rate minds were occupied

with Buddhist philosophy. For a period it lagged;
but today is in a different

position from what it was a generation ago.
<pb n="28"/>
Buddhism is no longer a decadent

religion and in certain countries it is
making considerable progress. It is

therefore to be hoped that this Dictionary
will help to interpret Chinese

culture both through the ages and today.

METHOD AND NOTES

1. The rule adopted has been to arrange the
terms, first, by strokes, then by

radicals, i. e.: -

(a) By the number of strokes in the initial
character of a term; then,

(b) According to its radical.

Thus 佛 will be found under seven strokes and under the 亻 radical; 法 under eight
strokes and the 氵 radical; 愛 under thirteen strokes and the 心 radical. A page index is provided
<pb n="29"/>
showing where changes in the number of strokes occur.

2. A list of difficult characters is
provided.

3. An index of the Sanskrit terms is given
with references to the Chinese text.

4. A limited number of abbreviations have
been used, which are self-evident,

e.g. tr. for translation, translator, etc.;
translit. for transliteration,

transliterate, etc.; abbrev. for
abbreviation; intp. for interpreted or

interpretation; u.f. for used for.
"Eitel" refers to Dr. Eitel's Handbook of

Chinese Buddhism; "M.W." to
Monier-Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary;

"Keith" to Professor A.
Berriedale Keith's Buddhist Philosophy; "Getty" to Miss

Alice Getty's The Gods of Northern
Buddhism; B.D. to the 佛學大辭典; B.N. to Bunyiu Nanjio's Catalogue.

5. Where characters are followed by others
<pb n="30"/>
in brackets, they are used alone or

in combination; e. g. in 十善 (正法) the term 十善 may be used
alone or in full 十善正法.

6. In the text a few variations occur in
the romanization of Sanskrit and other

non-Chinese words. These have been
corrected in the Sanskrit index, which should

be taken as giving the correct forms.

In this Dictionary it was not possible to
follow the principle of inserting

hyphens between the members of Sanskrit
compound words.

school,

higher meaning. The first four are (1)

common postulates on reality, considering
<pb n="230"/>
the nominal as real, e.g. a pot; (2)

common doctrinal postulates, e.g. the five
skandhas; (3) abstract postulates,

e.g. the four noble truths 四諦; and (4)
temporal postulates in regard to the

spiritual in the material. The second
abstract or philosophical four are (5)

postulates on constitution and function,
e.g. of the skandhas; (6) on cause and

effect, e.g. the 四諦; (7) on the

tasting, and touch. The sixth is

<pb n="231"/>

mentality, apprehension, or by some as
will. The seventh is styled

klista-mano-vijñāna

calculating; it is the discriminating and
constructive sense, more than the

intellectually perceptive; as infected by
the ālaya-vijñāna., or receiving

"seeds" from it, it is considered
as the cause of all egoism and

individualizing, i.e. of men and things,
therefore of all illusion arising from

assuming the seeming as the real. The
eighth is the ālaya-vijñāna, 阿頼耶識 which is

the storehouse, or basis from which come

"laying hold of" or "holding on to"

law-king, the conception of bodhisattvahood;

power of Amitābha, and assents with but a
thought, he will be received into

paradise. (3) 下品下生 The
lowest class, because of their sins, should have fallen

into the lowest gati, but by invoking the
name of Amitābha, they can escape

suffering and on dying will behold a lotus

flower like the sun, and, by the response
of a single thought, will enter the

Pure Land of Amitābha.

and the Mahāsānghikāh or 大衆部. At first

they were not considered to be different
schools, the 上座部 merely representing

the intimate and older disciples of
Śākyamuni and the 大衆 being the rest. It is

said that a century later under Mahādeva 大天 a
difference of opinion arose on

certain doctrines. Three divisions are
named as resulting, viz.

Mahāvihāravāsinah, Jetavanīyāh,
and Abhayagiri-vāsinah. These were in Ceylon. In

śāstra 婆沙論 77 or 俱舍論 20.

<xa>三乘</xa>Triyāna, the three vehicles, or conveyances which carry living
beings across
<pb n="323"/>

sajsāra or mortality (births-and-deaths)
to the shores of nirvāna. The three are

styled 小,中, and 大. Sometimes
the three vehicles are defined as 聲聞 Śrāvaka, that

of the hearer or obedient disciple; 緣覺Pratyeka-buddha,
that of the enlightened

for self; these are described as 小乘 because the
objective of both is personal

salvation; the third is 菩薩Bodhisattva,
or 大乘 Mahāyāna,
because the objective is

the salvation of all the living. The three
are also depicted as 三車 three wains,

drawn by a goat, a deer, an ox. The Lotus
declares that the three are really the

One Buddha-vehicle, which has been revealed
in three expedient forms suited to

his disciples' capacity, the Lotus Sūtra
being the unifying, complete, and final

exposition. The Three Vehicles are
<pb n="324"/>
differently explained by different exponents,

e.g. (1) Mahāyāna recognizes (a) Śrāvaka,
called Hīnayāna, leading in longer or

shorter periods to arhatship; (b)
Pratyeka-buddha, called Madhyamayāna, leading

after still longer or shorter periods to a
Buddhahood ascetically attained and

for self; (c) Bodhisattva, called Mahayana,
leading after countless ages of

self-sacrifce in saving others and
progressive enlightenment to ultimate

Buddhahood. (2) Hīnayāna is also described
as possessing three vehicles 聲, 緣, 菩

or 小, 中, 大, the 小 and 中 conveying to personal salvation their devotees in

ascetic dust and ashes and mental
annihilation, the 大 leading to bodhi, or

perfect enlightenment, and the Buddha's
way. Further definitions of the Triyāna

are: (3) True bodhisattva teaching for the 大;
pratyeka-buddha without ignorant
<pb n="325"/>

asceticism for the 中; and śrāvaka
with ignorant asceticism for the 小. (4) (a) 一乘

The One-Vehicle which carries all to
Buddhahood: of this the 華嚴 Hua-yen and 法華

Fa-hua are typical exponents; (b) 三乘法 the
three-vehicle, containing

practitioners of all three systems, as
expounded in books of the 深密般若; (c) 小乘

the Hīnayāna pure and simple as seen in the
<xa>四阿合經</xa>Four
Āgamas. Śrāvakas are also

described as hearers of the Four Truths and
limited to that degree of

development; they hear from the
pratyeka-buddhas, who are enlightened in the

Twelve Nidānas 因緣; the
bodhisattvas make the 六度 or six forms of transmigration

their field of sacrificial saving work, and
of enlightenment. The Lotus Sūtra

really treats the 三乘. Three Vehicles
<pb n="326"/>
as 方便 or
expedient ways, and offers a 佛乘

Buddha Vehicle as the inclusive and final
vehicle.

<xa>三乘家</xa>The Dharmalaksana School of the Three Vehicles, led by the 法相宗.

<xa>三十三天忉利天;</xa>憺梨天, 多羅夜登陵舍; 憺利夜登陵奢; 憺利耶憺利奢 Trayastrimśas. The Indra heaven, the second

of the six heavens of form. Its capital is
situated on the summit of Mt. Sumeru,

where Indra rules over his thirty-two
devas, who reside on thirty-two peaks of

Sumeru, eight in each of the four
directons. Indra's capital is called 殊勝

Sudarśana, 喜見城 Joy-view city. Its people are a
yojana in height, each one's

clothing weighs 六鐵 (1/4 oz. ),
and they live 1, 000 years, a day and night being

<pb n="336"/>
equal to 100 earthly years. Eitel says
Indra's heaven 'tallies in all its

details with the Svarga of Brahminic
mythology' and suggests that 'the whole

myth may have an astronomical meaning', or
be connected, with 'the atmosphere

with its phenomena, which strengthens Koeppen's
hypothesis explaining the number

thirty-three as referring to the eight
Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Ādityas, and

two Aśvins of Vedic mythology'. In his
palace called Vaijayanta 'Indra is

enthroned with 1, 000 eyes with four arms
grasping the vajra. There he revels in

numberless sensual pleasures together with
his wife Śacī… and with 119, 000

concubines with whom he associates by means
of transformation'.

<xa>三密</xa>The three mystic things: the body, mouth (i.e. voice), and mind of
the

Tathāgata, which are universal, all things
being this mystic body, all sound

this mystic voice, and all thought this
mystic mind. All creatures in body,

voice, and mind are only individualized
parts of the Tathāgata, but illusion

hides their Tathāgata nature from them. The
esoterics seek to realize their

Tathāgata nature by physical signs and
postures, by voicing of 眞言 dhāranī and by

meditations, so that 入我我入 He may
enter me and I Him, which is the perfection of

siddhi 悉地; v. 大日經疏 1. 菩提心論.

<xa>三寳</xa>Triratna, or Ratnatraya, i.e. the Three Precious Ones: 佛 Buddha, 法 Dharma, 儈

Savgha, i.e. Buddha, the Law, the
Ecelesia or Order. Eitel suggests this trinity

may be adapted from the Trimūrti, i.e,
Brahma, Visnu, and Sīva. The Triratna

takes many forms, e.g. the Trikāya 三身 q.v. There
is also the Nepalese idea of a

triple existence of each Buddha as a Nirvāna-Buddha,
Dhyāni-Buddha, and

Mānusi-Buddha; also
the Tantric trinity of Vairocana as Nirvāna-Buddha,
Locana

<pb n="354"/>
according to Eitel "existing in reflex
in the world of forms", and the human

Buddha, Śākyamuni. There are other
elaborated details known as the four and the

six kinds of triratna 四 and 六種三寳, e.g.
that the Triratna exists in each member

of the trinity. The term has also been
applied to the 三仙 q.v. Popularly the 三寳

are referred to the three images in the
main hall of monasteries. The centre one

is Śākyamuni, on his left Bhaisajya
<xa>藥師</xa>and on his
right Amitābha. There are

other explanations, e.g. in some temples
Amitābha is in the centre,

Avalokiteśvara on his left, and
Mahāsthāmaprāpta or Mañjuśrī on his right. Table

for an

ordination to full orders; except in

universal. Thus in samādhi the Buddha
"body" is found everywhere and in

everything (pan-Buddha), every sound
becomes a "true word", dhāranī or potent

phrase, and these are summed up in mind,
which being universal is my mind and my

mind it, 入我我入 it in me and I in it. Other
definitions of the three are 佛, 法, 儈

Buddha, and the living. Also 三三昧. Cf. 三密. v.

centuries of our era. The 三彌底部論 is in the

"that a soul exists in the highest and truest sense", "that

an arhat can fall from arhatship, that a
god can enter the paths of the Order,

and that even an unconverted man can get
rid of all lust and ill-will" (Eliot,

i, 260). It split into the three branches
of Kaurukullakāh Āvantikāh, and

describe his teaching as (a)

impermanence to permanence, from the void
to reality, etc.; (b) 頓 immediate for

it also has the division of 三藏敎 , 通敎 , and 別敎 q.v.

<xa>三教法師</xa>Master of the Tripitaka; a title of Xuanzang 玄奘.

<xa>三斷</xa>The three cuttings off or excisions (of 惑 beguiling

the nature or root (of

delusion); (b) 緣縛斷 to cut off
the external bonds, or objective causes (of

delusions); (c) 不生斷 (delusion)
no longer arising, therefore nothing produced to

cut off. The third stage in both groups is
that of an arhat.

<xa>三方便</xa>A term of the esoterics for body, mouth (speech), and mind, their
control,

and the entry into the 三密 q.v. 大日經疏 1.

[67]

<xa>三昧</xa>(三昧地) Samādhi, "putting together, composing the mind, intent
contemplation,

perfect absorption, union of the meditator
<pb n="373"/>
with the object of meditation." (M.

W.) Also 三摩地 (三摩提, 三摩帝, 三摩底). Interpreted by 定 or 正定, the mind
fixed and

undisturbed; by 正受 correct
sensation of the object contemplated; by 調直定 ordering

and fixing the mind; by 正心行處 the
condition when the motions of the mind are

steadied and harmonized with the object; by
<xa>息慮凝心</xa>the
cessation of distraction

and the fixation of the mind; by 等持 the mind
held in equilibrium; by 奢摩他, i.e.

<xa>止息</xa>to stay the breathing. It is described as concentration of the mind
(upon an

object). The aim is 解脫, mukti,
deliverance from all the trammels of life, the

bondage of the passions and reincarnations.
It may pass from abstraction to

ecstasy, or rapture, or trance. Dhyāna 定 represents a
simpler form of

<pb n="374"/>
contemplation; samāpatti 三摩鉢底 a stage
further advanced; and samādhi the highest

stage of the Buddhist equivalent for Yoga,
though Yoga is considered by some as

a Buddhist development differing from
samādhi. The 翻譯名義 says: 思專 when the mind

has been concentrated, then 志一不分 the will
is undivided; when 想寂 active thought

has been put to rest, then 氣虛神朗 the
material becomes etherealized and the spirit

liberated, on which 智 knowledge,
or the power to know, has free course, and

there is no mystery into which it cannot
probe. Cf. 智度論 5, 20, 23, 28; 止觀 2;

personality or a permanent soul; this
period is represented by the four 阿含經

āgamas and other Hīnayāna sūtras. (2) 空 Śūnya, when
<pb n="379"/>
he negatived the idea of 實法

the reality of things and advocated that

the mean, that mind or spirit is real, while

things are unreal; the period of this
school's specific sūtra the 解深密經, also the

his teaching to the development of his
hearers; in the third to have delivered

his complete and perfect doctrine. Another

<xa>三論宗</xa>The Sanlun, Mādhyamika, or Middle School, founded in India by
Nāgārjuna, in
<pb n="428"/>

China by 嘉祥 Jiaxiang during the reign of 安帝 An Di,
Eastern Jin, A.D. 397-419. It

flourished up to the latter part of the
Tang dynasty. In 625 it was carried to

Japan as Sanron. After the death of
Jiaxiang, who wrote the 三論玄義, a northern and

southern division took place. While the
Mādhyamika denied the reality of all

phenomenal existence, and defined the
noumenal world in negative terms, its aim

seems not to have been nihilistic, but the
advocacy of a reality beyond human

conception and expression, which in our
terminology may be termed a spiritual

realm.

<xa>三請</xa>A request thrice repeated— implying earnest desire.

<xa>三諦</xa>The three dogmas. The "middle" school of Tiantai says 卽空, 卽假. 卽中 i.e. 就是空, 假,

<xa>中;</xa>(a) by 空śūnya is meant that things causally produced are in their essential

<pb n="429"/>
nature unreal (or immaterial) 實空無; (b) 假, though
things are unreal in their

essential nature their derived forms are
real; (c) 中; but both are one, being of

the one 如 reality. These three dogmas are
founded on a verse of Nāgārjuna's—

<xa>因緣所生法</xa>, 我說卽是空 亦爲是假名, 亦是中道義
"All causally produced phenomena, I say, are unreal,

Are but a passing name, and indicate the
'mean'." There are other explanations—

the 圓教 interprets the 空 and 假 as 中; the 別教 makes 中 independent. 空 is the all,

i.e. the totality of all things, and is
spoken of as the 眞 or 實 true, or real; 假

is the differentiation of all things and is
spoken of as 俗 common, i.e. things

as commonly named; 中 is the
connecting idea which makes a unity of both, e.g.

"all are but parts of one stupendous
whole." The 中 makes all and the all into

one whole, unifying the whole and its
<pb n="430"/>
parts. 空 may be taken as the immaterial,

the undifferentiated all, the sum of
existences, by some as the tathāgatagarbha

<xa>如來藏;</xa>假as the unreal, or impermanent, the material or transient form, the

temporal that can be named, the relative or
discrete; 中 as the unifier, which

places each in the other and all in all.
The "shallower" 山外 school associated 空

and 中 with the noumenal universe as opposed to the phenomenal and
illusory

existence represented by 假. The
"profounder" 山内 school teaches that all three

are aspects of the same.



[77]

<xa>三諦相卽</xa>The unity of 空, 假, 中, three aspects of the same reality, taught by the 圓教as

distinguished from the 別教which
separates them.

<pb n="431"/>
<xa>三識</xa>The three states of mind or consciousness: 眞識 the
original unsullied

consciousness or Mind, the tathāgatagarbha,
the eighth or ālaya 阿賴耶識 ; 現識 mind

or consciousness diversified in contact
with or producing phenomena, good and

evil; 分別識 consciousness discriminating and evolving the objects of the five

senses. Also 意識 manas, 心識 ālaya, and 無垢識 amala, v. 識.

<xa>三變</xa>(土田) The three transformations of his Buddha-realm made by Śākyamuni on

Vulture peak—- first, his revelation of
this world, then its vast extension, and

again its still vaster extension. See Lotus
Sutra.

<xa>三賢十聖</xa>(or三賢十地). The three virtuous positions, or states, of a bodhisattva are 十住,

<xa>十行</xa>and 十廻向. The ten excellent characteristics of a 聖 saint or
holy one are the

whole of the 十地.

<xa>三跋致</xa>(or 諦) sampatti. To turn out well, prosper, be on the path of success.
<pb n="432"/>

<xa>三跋羅</xa>samvara. 三婆 (or 三嚩) To hinder, ward off, protect from falling into the three

inferior transmigrations; a divine being
that fills this office worshipped by

the Tantra School. The sixth vijñāna, v. 八識.

<xa>三身</xa>trikāya. 三寶身 The threefold body or nature of a Buddha, i.e. the 法, 報, and 化身,

or dharmakāya, sambhogakāya, and nirmānakāya.
The three are defined as 自性, 受用,

and 變化, the Buddha-body per se, or in its essential nature; his body of
bliss,

which he "receives" for his own
"use" and enjoyment; and his body of

transformation, by which he can appear in
any form; i.e. spiritual, or

essential; glorified; revealed. While the
doctrine of the trikāya is a Mahāyāna

concept, it partly results from the
Hīnayāna idealization of the earthly Buddha

with his thirty-two signs, eighty physical
marks, clairvoyance, clairaudience,
<pb n="433"/>

holiness, purity, wisdom, pity, etc.
Mahāyāna, however, proceeded to conceive of

Buddha as the Universal, the All, with
infinity of forms, yet above all our

concepts of unity or diversity. To every
Buddha Mahāyāna attributed a three-fold

body: that of essential Buddha; that of joy
or enjoyment of the fruits of his

past saving labours; that of power to
transform himself at will to any shape for

omnipresent salvation of those who need
him. The trinity finds different methods

of expression, e.g. Vairocana is entitled 法身, the
embodiment of the Law, shining

everywhere, enlightening all; Locana is 報身; c.f. 三賓, the
embodiment of purity

and bliss; Śākyamuni is 化身 or Buddha
revealed. In the esoteric sect they are 法

Vairocana, 報 Amitābha, and 化 Śākyamuni.
The 三賓 are also 法 dharma, 報 savgha,
<pb n="434"/>
<xa>化</xa>

buddha. Nevertheless, the three are
considered as a trinity, the three being

essentially one, each in the other. (1) 法身 Dharmakāya
in its earliest conception

was that of the body of the dharma, or
truth, as preached by Śākyamuni; later it

became his mind or soul in contrast with
his material body. In Mādhyamika, the

dharmakāya was the only reality, i.e. the
void, or the immateria1, the ground of

all phenomena; in other words, the 眞如 the
tathāgatagarbha, the bhūtatathatā.

According to the Huayan (Kegon) School it
is the 理or noumenon, while the other

two are氣or phenomenal aspects. "For
the Vijñānavāda… the body of the law as

highest reality is the void intelligence,
whose infection (samkleҫa) results in

the process of birth and death, whilst its
<pb n="435"/>
purification brings about Nirvāna, or

its restoration to its primitive
transparence" (Keith). The "body of the law is

the true reality of everything".
Nevertheless, in Mahāyāna every Buddha has his

own 法身; e.g. in the dharmakāya aspect we have the designation Amitābha,
who in

his sambhogakāya
aspect is styled Amitāyus. (2) 報身Sambhogakāya, a Buddha's

reward body, or body of enjoyment of the
merits he attained as a bodhisattva; in

other words, a Buddha in glory in his
heaven. This is the form of Buddha as an

object of worship. It is defined in two
aspects, (a) 自受用身 for his own bliss, and

(b) 他受用身 for the sake of others, revealing himself in his glory to
bodhisattvas,

enlightening and inspiring them. By wisdom
a Buddha's dharmakāya is attained, by

bodhisattva-merits his sambhogakāya.
<pb n="436"/>
Not only has every Buddha all the three

bodies or aspects, but as all men are of
the same essence, or nature, as

Buddhas, they are therefore potential
Buddhas and are in and of the trikāya.

Moreover, trikāya is not divided, for a
Buddha in his 化身 is still one with his

<xa>法身</xa>and 報身, all three bodies being co-existent. (3) 化身; 應身; 應化身 nirmānakāya,
a

Buddha's transformation, or miraculous
body, in which he appears at will and in

any form outside his heaven, e.g. as
Śākyamuni among men.

yāna, wain, or conveyance, or the greater
vehicle in comparison with the 小乘

Hīnayāna. It indicates universalism, or
Salvation for all, for all are Buddha

and will attain bodhi. It is the form of
Buddhism prevalent in Tibet, Mongolia,

China, Korea, Japan, and in other places in
the Far East. It is also called

Northern Buddhism. It is interpreted as 大教 the greater
teaching as compared with

<xa>小教</xa>the smaller, or inferior. Hīnayāna, which is undoubtedly nearer to
the

original teaching of the Buddha, is
unfairly described as an endeavour to seek

nirvana through an ash-covered body, an
<pb n="471"/>
extinguished intellect, and

solitariness; its followers are sravakas
and pratyekabuddhas (i.e. those who are

striving for their own deliverance through
ascetic works). Mahāyāna, on the

other hand, is described as seeking to find
and extend all knowledge, and, in

certain schools, to lead all to Buddhahood.
It has a conception of an Eternal

Buddha, or Buddhahood as Eternal
(Adi-Buddha), but its especial doctrines are,

inter alia, (a) the bodhisattvas 菩薩 , i.e.
beings who deny themselves final

Nirvana until, according to their vows,
they have first saved all the living;

(b) salvation by faith in, or invocation of
the Buddhas or bodhisattvas; (c)

Paradise as a nirvana of bliss in the
company of Buddhas, bodhisattvas, saints,

and believers. Hīnayāna is sometimes
<pb n="472"/>
described as 自利 self-benefiting, and

Mahāyāna as 自利利他 self-benefit for the benefit of
others, unlimited altruism and

pity being the theory of Mahāyāna. There is
a further division into one-yana and

three-yanas: the trīyāna may be śrāvaka,
pratyeka-buddha, and bodhisattva,

represented by a goat, deer, or bullock
cart; the one-yāna is that represented

by the Lotus School as the one doctrine of
the Buddha, which had been variously

taught by him according to the capacity of
his hearers, v. 方便. Though Mahāyāna

tendencies are seen in later forms of the
older Buddhism, the foundation of

Mahāyāna has been attributed to Nāgārjuna 龍樹. "The
characteristics of this

system are an excess of transcendental
speculation tending to abstract nihilism,

and the substitution of fanciful degrees of
<pb n="473"/>
meditation and contemplation (v.

Samādhi and Dhyāna) in place of the
practical asceticism of the Hīnayāna

school."[Eitel 68-9.] Two of its
foundation books are the 起信論and the 妙法蓮華經 but a

larnge numberof Mahāyāna sutras are
ascribed to the Buddha。.

<xa>大教</xa>The great teaching. (1) That of the Buddha. (2) Tantrayāna. The
mahātantra,

yoga, yogacarya, or tantra school which
claims Samantabhadra as its founder. It

aims at ecstatic union of the individual
soul with the world soul, Iśvara. From

this result the eight great powers of
Siddhi (asta-mahāsiddhi), namely, ability

to (1) make one's body lighter (laghiman);
(2) heavier (gaiman); (3) smaller
<pb n="504"/>

(animan); (4) larger (mahiman) than
anything in the world ; (5) reach any place

(prāpti) ; (6) assume any shape (prākāmya)
; (7) control all natural laws

(īśitva) ; (8) make everything depend upon
oneself; all at will (v.如意身 and 神足).

By means of mystic formulas (Tantras or
dhāranīs), or spells (mantras),

accompanied by music and manipulation of
the hands (mūdra), a state of mental

fixity characterized neither by thought nor
the annihilation of thought, can be

reached. This consists of six-fold bodily
and mental happiness (yoga), and from

this results power to work miracles. Asavga
compiled his mystic doctrines circa

A.D. 500. The system was introduced into
China A.D. 647 by Xuanzang's

translation of the Yogācārya-bhūmi-śāstra 瑜伽師地論 ; v. 瑜. On the
basis of this,

<xa>大方廣</xa>mahāvaipulya ; cf. 大方等 The great Vaipulyas, or sutras of Mahāyāna. 方廣 and 方等

are similar in meaning. Vaipulya is
extension, spaciousness, widespread, and

this is the idea expressed both in 廣 broad,
widespread, as opposed to narrow,

restricted, and in 等 levelled up,
equal everywhere, universal. These terms

suggest the broadening of the basis of
Buddhism, as is found in Mahāyāna. The
<pb n="506"/>

Vaipulya works are styled sutras, for the
broad doctrine of universalism, very

different from the traditional account of
his discourses, is put into the mouth

of the Buddha in wider, or universal
aspect. These sutras are those of

universalism, of which the Lotus 法華 is an
outstanding example. The form Vaitulya

instead of Vaipulya is found in some
Kashgar MSS. of the Lotus, suggesting that

in the Vetulla sect lies the origin of the
Vaipulyas, and with them of Mahāyāna,

but the evidence is inadequate.

<xa>大方廣佛</xa>The 本尊 fundamental honoured one of the 華嚴經, described as the Buddha who has


realized the universal law.

<xa>大方等</xa>Mahāvaipulya or vaipulya 大方廣; 毗佛畧. They are called 無量義經 sutras of infinite

meaning, or of the infinite; first
introduced into China by Dharmaraksa

(A.D.266―317). The name is common to
Hīnayāna and Mahayana, but chiefly claimed

by the latter for its special sutras as
extending and universalizing the

Buddha's earlier preliminary teaching. v. 大方廣 and 方等.

<xa>大方等大集經</xa>Mahāvaipulya-mahāsamnipāta-sūtra, tr. A.D. 397―439, said to have been

assembled from every region, by a great
staircase made between the world of

desire and that of form". B.N. Another
version was made by Jñānagupta and others

in A.D. 594 called 大方等大集賢護經.

<xa>大日</xa>Vairocana, or Mahāvairocana 大日如來; 遍照如來; 摩訶毘盧遮那； 毘盧遮那; 大日覺王 The sun,
"shining

everywhere" The chief object of
worship of the Shingon sect in Japan,

<pb n="509"/>
"represented by the gigantic image in
the temple at Nara." (Eliot.) There he is

known as Dai-nichi-nyorai. He is counted as
the first, and according to some,

the origin of the five celestial Buddhas
(dhyāni-buddhas, or jinas). He dwells

quiescent in Arūpa-dhātu, the Heaven beyond
form, and is the essence of wisdom

(bodhi) and of absolute purity.
Samantabhadra 普賢 is his dhyāni-bodhisattva. The

<xa>大日經</xa>"teaches that Vairocana is the whole world, which is divided
into

Garbhadhātu (material) and Vajradhātu
(indestructible), the two together forming

Dharmadhātu. The manifestations of
Vairocana's body to himself―that is, Buddhas

and Bodhisattvas ―are represented
symbolically by diagrams of several circles ".

Eliot. In the 金剛界 or
vajradhātu mandala he is the center of the five groups. In

<pb n="510"/>
the 胎藏界 or Garbhadhātu he is the center of the eight-leaf (lotus) court.
His

appearance, symbols, esoteric word, differ
according to the two above

distinctions. Generally he is considered as
an embodiment of the Truth 法, both

in the sense of dharmakāya 法身 and
dharmaratna 法寳. Some hold Vairocana to be the

dharmakāya of Śākyamuni 大日與釋迦同一佛 but
the esoteric school denies this identity.

Also known as 最高顯廣眼藏如來, the
Tathagata who, in the highest, reveals the

far-reaching treasure of his eye, i.e. the
sun. 大日大聖不動明王 is
described as one of

his transformations. Also, a śramaņa of
Kashmir (contemporary of

Padma-sambhava); he is
credited with introducing Buddhism into Khotan and being

an incarnation of Mañjuśrī; the king Vijaya
Sambhava built a monastery for him.

is described under two forms, one as the
prince of demons, the other as divine,

head of the demons, he is represented with

extinction and cessation; or 大圓寂入 great
entrance into perfect rest; 大滅度 great

extinction and passing over (from
mortality). It is interpreted in Mahāyāna as

meaning the cessation or extinction of
passion and delusion, of mortality, and

of all activities, and deliverance into a
state beyond these concepts. In
<pb n="531"/>

Mahāyāna it is not understood as the
annihilation, or cessation of existence;

the reappearance of Dīpamkara
<xa>然燈</xa>(who had
long entered nirvāna) along with

Śākyamuni on the Vulture Peak supports this
view. It is a state above all terms

of human expression. See the Lotus Sutra

Buddha.

<xa>大魚</xa>makara 摩竭羅 a monster fish.

<xa>大黑天</xa>Mahākāla 摩訶迦 (or 謌) 羅 the great black deva 大黑神. Two interpretations are

given. The esoteric cult describes the deva
as the masculine form of Kālī, i.e.

Durgā, the wife of Śiva; with one face and
eight arms, or three faces and six

arms, a necklace of skulls, etc. He is worshipped
as giving warlike power, and

fierceness; said also to be an incarnation
of Vairocana for the purpose of
<pb n="546"/>

destroying the demons; and is described as 大時 the
"great time"　(-keeper) which

seems to indicate Vairocana, the sun. The
exoteric cult interprets him as a

beneficent deva, a Pluto, or god of wealth.
Consequently he is represented in

two forms, by the one school as a fierce
deva, by the other as a kindly happy

deva. He is shown as one of the eight
fierce guardians with trident, generally

blue-black but sometimes white; he may have
two elephants underfoot. Six arms

and hands hold jewel, skull cup, chopper,
drum, trident, elephant-goad. He is

the tutelary god of Mongolian Buddhism. Six
forms of Mahākāla are noted: (1)

<xa>比丘大黑</xa>A black-faced disciple of the Buddha, said to be the Buddha as
Mahādeva in

a previous incarnation, now guardian of the
refectory. (2) 摩訶迦羅大黑女 Kālī, the
<pb n="547"/>

wife of Śiva. (3) 王子迦羅大黑 The son
of Śiva. (4) 眞陀大黑 Cintāmani, with the

talismanic pearl, symbol of bestowing
fortune. (5) 夜叉大黑 Subduer of demons. (6)

<xa>摩迦羅大黑</xa>Mahākāla, who carries a bag on his back and holds a hammer in his

fire that would burn men may yet be
approached, clear breezes without form may

yet be grasped, cobras that harbour poison
may yet be touched, but a woman's

heart is never to be relied upon." The
Buddha ordered Ānanda: "Do not Look at a

woman; if you must, then do not talk with
her; if you must, then call on the

Buddha with all your mind"— an evidently
apocryphal statement of 文句 8.

<xa>女人六欲</xa>The six feminine attractions; eight are given, but the sixth and

<xa>小</xa>Small, little; mean, petty; inferior.

<xa>小乘</xa>Hīnayāna 希那衍. The small, or inferior wain, or vehicle; the form of Buddhism

which developed after Śākyamuni's death to
about the beginning of the Christian

era, when Mahāyāna doctrines were
introduced. It is the orthodox school and more

in direct line with the Buddhist succession
than Mahāyānism which developed on

lines fundamentally different. The Buddha
<pb n="554"/>
was a spiritual doctor, less

interested in philosophy than in the remedy
for human misery and perpetual

transmigration. He "turned aside from
idle metaphysical speculations; if he held

views on such topics, he deemed them
valueless for the purposes of salvation,

which was his goal" (Keith).
Metaphysical speculations arose after his death,

and naturally developed into a variety of
Hīnayāna schools before and after the

separation of a distinct school of
Mahāyāna. Hīnayāna remains the form in

Ceylon, Burma, and Siam, hence is known as
Southern Buddhism in contrast with

Northern Buddhism or Mahāyāna, the form
chiefly prevalent from Nepal to Japan.

Another rough division is that of Pali and
Sanskrit, Pali being the general

literary language of the surviving form of
<pb n="555"/>
Hīnayāna, Sanskrit of Mahāyāna. The

term Hīnayāna is of Mahāyānist origination
to emphasize the universalism and

altruism of Mahāyāna over the narrower
personal salvation of its rival.

According to Mahāyāna teaching its own aim
is universal Buddhahood, which means

the utmost development of wisdom and the
perfect transformation of all the

living in the future state; it declares
that Hīnayāna, aiming at arhatship and

pratyekabuddhahood, seeks the destruction
of body and mind and extinction in

nirvāna. For
arhatship the 四諦Four Noble Truths are the foundation teaching, for

pratyekabuddhahood the 十二因緣
twelve-nidānas, and these two are therefore

sometimes styled the two vehicles 二乘. Tiantai
sometimes calls them the

(Hīnayāna) Tripitaka school.
<pb n="556"/>
Three of the eighteen Hīnayāna schools were

transported to China: 倶舍
(Abhidharma) Kośa; 成實 Satya-siddhi; and the school of

Harivarman, the律 Vinaya
school. These are described by Mahāyānists as the

Buddha's adaptable way of meeting the
questions and capacity of his hearers,

though his own mind is spoken of as always
being in the absolute Mahāyāna

all-embracing realm. Such　is the
Mahāyāna view of Hīnayāna, and if the Vaipulya

sūtras and special scriptures of their
school, which are repudiated by Hīnayāna,

are apocryphal, of which there seems no
doubt, then Mahāyāna in condemning

Hīnayāna must find other support for its
claim to orthodoxy. The sūtras on which

it chiefly relies, as regards the Buddha,
have no authenticity; while those of

Hīnayāna cannot be accepted as his
<pb n="557"/>
veritable teaching in the absence of

fundamental research. Hīnayāna is said to
have first been divided into minority

and majority sections immediately after the
death of Śākyamuni, when the

sthāvira, or older disciples, remained in
what is spoken of as "the cave", some

place at Rājagrha, to settle
the future of the order, and the general body of

disciples remained outside; these two are
the first 上坐部 and 大衆部 q. v. The first

doctrinal division is reported to have
taken place under the leadership of the

monk 大天 Mahādeva (q.v.) a hundred years after the Buddha's nirvāna
and during

the reign of Aśoka; his reign, however, has
been placed later than this by

historians. Mahādeva's sect became the
Mahāsāvghikā, the other the Sthāvira. In

time the two are said to have divided into
<pb n="558"/>
eighteen, which with the two

originals are the so-called "twenty
sects" of Hīnayāna. Another division of four

sects, referred to by Yijing, is that of
the 大衆部 (Arya)
Mahāsavghanikāya, 上座部

Āryasthavirāh, 根本說一切有部
Mūlasarvāstivādah, and 正量部 Sammatīyāh. There is still

another division of five sects, 五部律. For the
eighteen Hīnayāna sects see 小乘十八部.

<xa>小乘十八部</xa>A Chinese list of the "eighteen" sects of the Hīnayāna,
omitting

Mahāsāvghikāh,
Sthavira, and Sarvāstivādah as generic schools: I. 大衆部 The

Mahāsāvghikāh is
divided into eight schools as follows: (1) 一說部 Ekavyavahārikāh;

(2) 說出世部 Lokottaravādinah; (3) 雞胤部 Kaukkutikāh (Gokulikā); (4) 多聞部 Bahuśrutīyāh;

(5) 說假部 Prajñāptivadinah; (6) 制多山部 Jetavaniyāh, or Caityaśailāh; (7) 西山住部

Aparaśailāh; (8) 北山住部
Uttaraśailāh. II. 上坐部 Āryasthavirāh, or Sthāviravādin,

divided into eight schools: (1) 雪山部 Haimavatāh.
The 說一切有部
<pb n="560"/>
Sarvāstivādah gave

rise to (2) 犢子部 Vātsīputrīyāh,
which gave rise to (3) 法上部 Dharmottarīyāh; (4)

<xa>賢冑部</xa>Bhadrayānīyāh; (5) 正量部 Sammatīyāh; and (6) 密林山 Sannagarikāh; (7) 化地部

Mahīśāsakāh produced (8) 法藏部
Dharmaguptāh. From the Sarvāstivādins arose also

(9) 飮光部 Kāśyahpīyā and (10) 經量部 Sautrāntikāh. v. 宗輪論. Cf Keith, 149-150. The

division of the two schools is ascribed to
Mahādeva a century after the Nirvāna.

Under I the first five are stated as
arising two centuries after the Nirvāna,

and the remaining three a century later,
dates which are unreliable. Under II,

the Haimavatāh and the
Sarvāstivādah are dated some 200 years after the Nirvāna;

from the Sarvāstivādins soon arose the
Vātsīputrīyas, from whom soon sprang the

third, fourth, fifth, and sixth; then from
the Sarvāstivādins there arose the

<pb n="561"/>
seventh which gave rise to the eighth, and
again, nearing the 400th year, the

Sarvāstivādins gave rise to the ninth and
soon after the tenth. In the list of

eighteen the Sarvāstivādah is not counted,
as it split into all the rest.

<xa>小乘四門</xa>Tiantai's division of Hīnayāna into four schools or doctrines: (1) 有門 Of

reality, the existence of all phenomena,
the doctrine of being (cf. 發智六足論,

etc.); (2) 空門 of unreality, or non-existence
(cf. 成實論); (3) 亦有亦空門 of both,
or

relativity of existence and non-existence
(cf. 毘勒論); (4) 非有非空 of
neither, or

transcending existence and non-existence
(cf. 迦旃延經).

<xa>小乘外道</xa>Hīnayāna and the heretical sects; also, Hīnayāna is a heretical
sect.

<xa>小乘戒</xa>The commandments of the Hīnayāna, also recognized by the Mahāyāna:

eight, and ten commandments, the 250 for
the monks, and the 348 for the nuns.

or nothing, or, that

which has form, and is therefore measurable
and ponderable, and its opposite of

total non-existence. See 中論. The
following four Schools define the term

according to their several scriptures: the 法相 School
describes it as the 唯識, v.

<xa>唯識中道;</xa>the 三論 School as the 八不 eight negations, v. 三論; the Tiantai as 實相 the true

reality; and the Huayan as the 法界

<xa>五智</xa>The five kinds of wisdom of the 眞言宗 Shingon School. Of the six
elements 六大

earth, water, fire, air (or wind), ether
(or space) 曇空, and consciousness (or

mind 識 ), the first five form the phenomenal world, or Garbhadhātu, the
womb of

all things 胎藏界, the sixth is the conscious, or
perceptive, or wisdom world, the

Vajradhātu 金剛界, sometimes called the Diamond
realm. The two realms are not

originally apart, but one, and there is no
consciousness without the other five

elements. The sixth element, vijñāna, is
further subdivided into five called the

<xa>五智</xa>Five Wisdoms: (1) 法界體性智 dharmadhātu-prakrti-jñāna, derived from the

amala-vijñāna, or pure 識; it is the
wisdom of the embodied nature of the
<pb n="674"/>

dharmadhātu, defined as the six elements,
and is associated with Vairocana 大日,

in the centre, who abides in this samādhi;
it also corresponds to the ether 空

element. (2) 大圓鏡智 adarśana-jñāna, the great round
mirror wisdom, derived from

the ālaya-vijñāna, reflecting all things;
corresponds to earth, and is

associated with Aksobhya and the
east. (3) 平等性智 samatā-jñāna, derived from

mano-vijñāna, wisdom in regard to all
things equally and universally;

corresponds to fire, and is associated with
Ratnasambhava and the south. (4)

<xa>妙觀察智</xa>pratyaveksana-jñāna, derived from 意識, wisdom of profound insight, or

discrimination, for exposition and
doubt-destruction; corresponds to water, and

is associated with Amitābha and the west.
(5) 成所作智 krtyānusthāna-jñāna,
derived
<pb n="675"/>

from the five senses, the wisdom of
perfecting the double work of self-welfare

and the welfare of others; corresponds to
air 風 and is
associated with

Amoghasiddhi and the north. These five
Dhyāni-Buddhas are the 五智如來. The five

kinds of wisdom are the four belonging to
every Buddha, of the exoteric cult, to

which the esoteric cult adds the first,
pure, all-refecting, universal,

all-discerning, and all-perfecting.

<xa>五智如來</xa>五智五佛; 五佛; 五如來 The five
Dhyāni-Buddhas, or Wisdom-Tathāgatas of the

Vajradhātu 金剛界, idealizations of five aspects
of wisdom; possibly of Nepalese

origin. The Wisdom Buddha represents the
dharmakāya or Buddha-mind, also the

Dharma of the triratna, or trinity. Each
evolves one of the five colours, one of
<pb n="676"/>

the five senses, a Dhyani-bodhisattva in
two forms one gracious, the other

fierce, and a Mānusi-Buddha; each
has his own śakti, i. e. feminine energy or

complement; also his own bīja, or
germ-sound 種子 or 印 seal, i. e. 眞言 real or

substantive word, the five being for 大日 am,
for 阿閦 hūm,
for 寶生 ? hrīh,
for 彌陀 ?

ah, for 不 空 ? āh. The five are
also described as the emanations or forms of an

Ādi-Buddha, Vajrasattva; the four are
considered by others to be emanations or

forms of Vairocana as the Supreme Buddha.
The five are not always described as

the same, e. g. they may be 藥師 (or 王) Bhaisajya,
<xa>多寶</xa>
Prabhūtaratna, Vairocana,

Aksobhya, and either Amoghasiddhi or
Śākyamuni. Below is a classified list of
<pb n="677"/>

the generally accepted five with certain
particulars connected with them, but

these differ in different places, and the
list can only be a general guide. As

to the Dhyāni-bodhisattvas, each Buddha
evolves three forms 五佛生五菩薩, 五金剛, 五忿怒, i.

e. (1) a bodhisattva who represents the
Buddha's dharmakāya, or spiritual body;

(2) a vajra or diamond form who represents
his wisdom in graciousness; and (3) a

fierce or angry form, the 明王 who
represents his power against evil. (1)

Vairocana appears in the three forms of 轉法輪菩薩
Vajra-pāramitā Bodhisattva, 遍照金剛

Universally Shining Vajrasattva, and 不動明王
Ārya-Acalanātha Rāja; (2) Aksobhya's

three forms are 虛空藏
Ākāśagarbha, 如意 complete power, and 軍荼利明王 Kundalī-rāja; (3 )

<xa>文尼</xa>muni, idem 牟尼 and 茂尼, e. g. Śākyamuni.

<xa>文殊</xa>(文殊師利) Mañjuśrī 滿殊尸利 -later 曼殊室利. 文殊 is also used for Mañjunātha, Mañjudeva,

Mañjughosa, Mañjusvara,
et al. T., hjamdpal; J., Monju. Origin unknown;

presumably, like most Buddhas and
bodhisattvas, an idealization of a particular

quality, in his case of Wisdom. Mañju is
beautiful, Śrī; good fortune, virtue,

majesty, lord, an epithet of a god. Six
definitions are obtained from various

scriptures: 妙首 (or 頭 ) wonderful
<pb n="862"/>
or beautiful) head; 普首 universal head; 濡首

glossy head (probably a transliteration); 敬首 revered
head; 妙德 wonderful virtue

(or power); 妙吉祥 wonderfully auspicious; the last
is a later translation in the

<xa>西域記</xa>. As guardian of wisdom 智慧 he is often placed on Śākyamuni's left, with 普顯 on

the right as guardian of law 理, the latter
holding the Law, the former the

wisdom or exposition of it; formerly they
held the reverse positions. He is

often represented with five curls or waves
to his hair indicating the 五智 q. v.

or the five peaks; his hand holds the sword
of wisdom and he sits on a lion

emblematic of its stern majesty: but he has
other forms. He is represented as a

youth, i. e. eternal youth. His present
abode is given as east of the universe,

known as 淸涼山 clear and cool mountain, or a
region 寶住 precious abode, or Abode of
<pb n="863"/>

Treasures, or 寶氏 from which
he derives one of his titles, 寶相如來. One of his

dhāranīs prophesies
China as his post-nirvāna realm. In past incarnations he is

described as being the parent of many
Buddhas and as having assisted the Buddha

into existence; his title was 龍種上佛 the
supreme Buddha of the nāgas, also 大身佛 or

<xa>神仙佛;</xa>now his title is 歡喜藏摩尼寶精佛 The spiritual Buddha who joyfully cares for the

jewel: and his future title is to be 普現佛 Buddha
universally revealed. In the 序品

Introductory Chapter of the Lotus Sutra he
is also described as the ninth

predecessor or Buddha-ancestor of
Śākyamuni. He is looked on as the chief of the

Bodhisattvas and represents them, as the
chief disciple of the Buddha, or as his

son 法王子. Hīnayāna counts Śāriputra as the wisest of the disciples, Mahāyāna


<pb n="864"/>
gives Mañjuśrī the chief place, hence he is
also styled 覺母 mother, or begetter

of understanding. He is shown riding on
either a lion or a peacock, or sitting

on a white lotus; often he holds a book,
emblem of wisdom, or a blue lotus; in

certain rooms of a monastery he is shown as
a monk; and he appears in military

array as defender of the faith. His signs,
magic words, and so on, are found in

various sutras. His most famous centre in
China is Wu-tai shan in Shansi. where

he is the object of pilgrimages, especially
of Mongols. The legends about him

are many. He takes the place in Buddhism of
Viśvakarman as Vulcan, or architect,

of the universe. He is one of the eight
Dhyāni-bodhisattvas, and sometimes has

the image of Aksobhya in his
crown. He was mentioned in China as early as the

<pb n="865"/>
fourth century and in the Lotus Sutra he
frequently appears, especially as the

converter of the daughter of the
Dragon-king of the Ocean. He has five

messengers 五使者 and eight youths 八童子 attending
on him. His hall in the

Garbhadhātu mandala is the
seventh, in which his group numbers twenty-five. His

position is northeast. There are numerous
sutras and other works with his name

as title, e. g. 文殊師利問菩提經
Gayaśīrsa sūtra, tr. by Kumārajīva 384-417: and its 論

or .Tīkā of Vasubandhu, tr. by Bodhiruci
535. see list in B. N.

previous incarnation of the Buddha, who
still ambitious, despite his universal

<pb n="868"/>

<xa>方丈</xa>An abbot, 寺主 head of a monastery; the term is said to arise from the ten-foot

cubic dwelling in which 維摩 Vimalakirti
lived, but here seems to be no Sanskrit

equivalent.

<xa>方便</xa>upāya. Convenient to the place, or situation, suited to the
condition,

opportune, appropriate; but 方 is
interpreted as 方法 method, mode, plan, and 便 as

<xa>便用</xa>convenient for use, i. e. a convenient or expedient method; also 方 as 方正 and

<xa>便</xa>as 巧妙, which implies strategically correct. It is also intp. as 權道智 partial,

temporary, or relative (teaching of)
knowledge of reality, in contrast with 般若智

prajñā, and 眞實 absolute truth, or reality
instead of the seeming. The term is a

translation of 傴和 upāya, a
mode of approach, an expedient, stratagem, device.

The meaning is— teaching according to the
capacity of the hearer, by any

<pb n="869"/>
suitable method, including that of device
or stratagem, but expedience

beneficial to the recipient is understood.
Mahāyāna claims that the Buddha used

this expedient or partial method in his
teaching until near the end of his days,

when he enlarged it to the revelation of
reality, or the preaching of his final

and complete truth; Hīnayāna with reason
denies this, and it is evident that the

Mahāyāna claim has no foundation, for the
whole of its 方等 or 方廣 scriptures are

of later invention. Tiantai speaks of the 三乘 q. v. or
Three Vehicles as 方便

expedient or partial revelations, and of
its 一乘 or One
Vehicle as the complete

revelation of universal Buddhahood. This is
the teaching of the Lotus Sutra,

which itself contains 方便 teaching to
lead up to the full revelation; hence the
<pb n="870"/>

terms 體内 (or 同體 ) 方便, i. e. expedient or partial truths within the full

revelation, meaning the expedient part of
the Lotus, and 體外方便 the expedient or

partial truths of the teaching which
preceded the Lotus; see the 方便品 of that

work, also the second chapter of the 維摩經. 方便 is also the
seventh of the ten

pāramitās.

<xa>方便化身土</xa>An intermediate 'land 'of the Japanese monk 見眞 Kenshin,
below the

transformation-body.

others).

<xa>方便有餘土</xa>One of the Tiantai 四土 Four Lands, which is temporary, as its occupants

still have remains to be purged away.
<pb n="871"/>

<xa>方便殺生</xa>The right of great Bodhisattvas, knowing every one's karma, to kill
without

sinning, e. g. in order to prevent a person
from committing sin involving

unintermitted suffering, or to aid him in
reaching one of the higher

reincarnations.

<xa>方便波羅蜜</xa>upāya, the seventh pāramitā.

<xa>方便波羅蜜菩薩</xa>A bodhisattva in the Garbhadhātu group, the second on the right in

<xa>方便假門</xa>Expedient gates or ways of using the seeming for the real.

<xa>方典</xa>A term covering the whole of the Mahāyāna sutras, idem 方等經典.

<xa>方口食</xa>Opportunism in obtaining a living, i. e. a monk who makes a living
by

fawning or by bullying, one of the 四邪命 four
illicit ways of livelihood.

<xa>方外</xa>Out of the world; the life of a monk.

<xa>方廣</xa>vaipulya, 毘佛略 expansion, enlargement, broad, spacious. 方 is intp. by 方正

correct in doctrine and 廣 by 廣博 broad or
wide; some interpret it by elaboration,

or fuller explanation of the doctrine; in
general it may be taken as the broad

school, or wider teaching, in contrast with
the narrow school, or Hīnayāna. The

term covers the whole of the specifically
Mahāyāna sutras. The sutras are also

known as 無量義經 scriptures of measureless
meaning, i. e. universalistic, or the
<pb n="873"/>

infinite. Cf. 方等.

<xa>方廣大莊嚴經</xa>A vaipulya sutra, the Lalita-vistara, in 12 chuan, giving an
account of

the Buddha in the Tusita
heaven and his descent to earth as Śākyamuni: tr. by

Divākara under the Tang dynasty; another
tr. is the 普曜經.

<xa>方廣道人</xa>Heretical followers of Mahāyāna, who hold a false doctrine of 空 the Void,

teaching it as total non-existence, or
nihilism.

<xa>方相</xa>Square, four square, one of the five shapes.

<xa>方等</xa>vaipulya; cf. 方廣. 方 is interpreted as referring to the doctrine, 等 as equal,

or universal, i. e. everynwhere equally. An
attempt is made to distinguish

between the two above terms, 方廣 being now
used for vaipulya, but they are

interchangeable. Eitel says the vaipulya
sutras 'are distinguished by an

<pb n="874"/>
expansion of doctrine and style (Sūtras
developées, Burnouf). They are

apparently of later date, showing the
influence of different schools; their

style is diffuse and prolix, repeating the
same idea over and over again in

prose and in verse; they are also
frequently interlarded with prophecies and

dhāranīs'; but the
two terms seem to refer rather to the content than the form.

The content is that of universalism.
Chinese Buddhists assert that all the

sutras from the 華嚴 Huayan
onwards are of this class and therefore are Mahāyāna.

Consequently all 方等 or 方廣 sutras are
claimed by that school. Cf. 方便.

<xa>方等三昧</xa>One of Tiantai's methods of inducing samādhi, partly by walking,
partly by

abstraction, rather than contemplation; see 止觀

In practice there are three methods of
attaining such abstraction: (a) by fixing

organism is at rest it is called 止 zhi, when
the mind is seeing clearly it is

<pb n="892"/>
called 觀 guan. The term and form of
meditation is specially connected with its

chief exponent, the founder of the Tiantai
school, which school is styled 止觀宗

Zhiguan Zong, its chief object being
concentration of the mind by special

methods for the purpose of clear insight
into truth, and to be rid of illusion.

The Tiantai work gives ten fields of
mediation, or concentration: (1) the 五陰,

<xa>十八界</xa>, and 十二入; (2) passion and delusion; (3) sickness; (4) karma forms; (5)

<xa>比</xa>To compare; than; to assemble, arrive; partisan; each; translit.
pi, bhi, vi,

<xa>比丘</xa>比呼; 苾芻; 煏芻 bhiksu, a
religious mendicant, an almsman, one who has left home,

been fully ordained, and depends on alms
for a living. Some are styled 乞士

mendicant scholars, all are 釋種 Śākya-seed,
offspring of Buddha. The Chinese

characters are clearly used as a phonetic
<pb n="894"/>
equivalent, but many attempts have

been made to give meanings to the two
words, e. g. 比 as 破 and 丘 as 煩惱, hence one

who destroys the passions and delusions,
also 悕能 able to
overawe Māra and his

minions; also 除饉 to get rid
of dearth, moral and spiritual. Two kinds 内乞 and 外乞;

both indicate self-control, the first by
internal mental or spiritual methods,

the second by externals such as strict
diet. 苾芻 is a fragrant plant, emblem of

the monastic life.

<xa>比丘尼</xa>苾芻尼; 尼姑 bhiksunī. A
nun, or almswoman. The first woman to be ordained was

the Buddha's aunt Mahāprajāpatī, who had
nursed him. In the fourteenth year

after his enlightenment the Buddha yielded
to persuasion and admitted his aunt

and women to his order of religious
<pb n="895"/>
mendicants, but said that the admission of

women would shorten the period of Buddhism
by 500 years. The nun, however old,

must acknowledge the superiority of every
monk; must never scold him or tell his

faults; must never accuse him, though he
may accuse her; and must in all

respects obey the rules as commanded by
him. She accepts all the rules for the

monks with additional rules for her own
order. Such is the theory rather than

the practice. The title by which
Mahāprajāpatī was addressed was applied to

nuns, i. e. ārya, or noble, 阿姨, though
some consider the Chinese term entirely

native.

<xa>比丘尼戒</xa>The nun's '500 rules' and the eight commanding respect for monks,

<xa>四禪</xa>(四禪天) The four dhyāna heavens, 四靜慮 (四靜慮天), i. e. the division of the eighteen

brahmalokas into four dhyānas: the disciple
attains to one of these heavens

according to the dhyāna he observes: (1) 初禪天 The first
region, 'as large as one

whole universe' comprises the three
heavens, Brahma-pārisadya, Brahma-purohita,

and Mahābrahma, 梵輔, 梵衆, and 大梵天; the
inhabitants are without gustatory or

olfactory organs, not needing food, but
possess the other four of the six

organs. (2) 二禪天 The second region, equal to 'a
small chiliocosmos' 小千界,

comprises the three heavens, according to
Eitel, 'Parīttābha, Apramānābha, and

Ābhāsvara, ' i. e. 少光 minor
light, 無量光 infinite light, and 極光淨 utmost light

purity; the inhabitants have ceased to
require the five physical organs,

possessing only the organ of mind. (3) 三禪天 The third
<pb n="12"/>
region, equal to 'a

middling chiliocosmos '中千界, comprises
three heavens; Eitel gives them as

Parīttaśubha, Apramānaśubha,
and Śubhakrtsna, i. e. 少淨 minor purity, 無量淨

infinite purity, and 徧淨 universal
purity; the inhabitants still have the organ

of mind and are receptive of great joy. (4)
<xa>四禪天</xa>The fourth
region, equal to a

great chiliocosmos, 大千界, comprises
the remaining nine brahmalokas, namely,

Punyaprasava, Anabhraka, Brhatphala,

Sudarśana, and Akanistha
(Eitel). The Chinese titles are 福生 felicitous birth, 無雲

cloudless, 廣果 large fruitage, 無煩 no
vexations, atapa is 無熱 no heat, sudrśa is 善見

beautiful to see, sudarśana is 善現 beautiful
appearing, two others are 色究竟 the

<pb n="13"/>
end of form, and 無想天 the heaven
above thought, but it is difficult to trace

avrha and akanistha;
the inhabitants of this fourth region still have mind. The

number of the dhyāna heavens differs; the
Sarvāstivādins say 16, the 經 or Sutra

school 17, and the Sthavirāh school
18. Eitel points out that the first dhyāna

has one world with one moon, one mem, four
continents, and six devalokas; the

second dhyāna has 1, 000 times the worlds
of the first; the third has 1, 000

times the worlds of the second; the fourth
dhyāna has 1, 000 times those of the

third. Within a kalpa of destruction 壞劫 the first
is destroyed fifty-six times

by fire, the second seven by water, the
third once by wind, the fourth

'corresponding to a state of absolute
indifference' remains 'untouched' by all

<pb n="14"/>
the other evolutions; when 'fate (天命) comes to
an end then the fourth dhyāna may

come to an end too, but not sooner'.

[182]

<xa>四記</xa>(or 四答) The Buddha's for methods of dealing with questions: direct answer,


discriminating answer, questioning in
return, and silence.

<xa>四評家</xa>The four great scholars (among the 500 arhats) who made the Vibhāsā-śāstra,
<pb n="27"/>


a critical commentary on the Abhidharma.
Their names are 世友 Vasumitra, 妙音 Ghosa,

<xa>法救</xa>Dharmatrāta, and 覺天
Buddhadeva.

<xa>四論</xa>Four famous śāstras: (1) 中觀論Prānyamūla-śāstratīkā by Nāgārjuna, four juan;

(2) 百論 Śata-śāstra by devabodhisattva, two juan; (3) 十二門論

Dvādaśanikāya(-mukha)-śāstra by Nāgārjuna,
one juan; (4) 大智度論

Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra by Nāgārjuna, 100
juan. During the Sui dynasty the

followers of these four śāstras formed the 四論宗.

<xa>四諦</xa>catvāri-ārya-satyāni; 四聖諦; 四眞諦. The four dogmas, or noble truths, the primary

and fundamental doctrines of Śākyamuni,
said to approximate to the form of

medical diagnosis. They are pain or
'suffering, its cause, its ending, the way

thereto; that existence is suffering, that
human passion (tanhā, 欲 desire) is
<pb n="28"/>

the cause of continued suffering, that by
the destruction of human passion

existence may be brought to an end; that by
a life of holiness the destruction

of human passion may be attained'.
Childers. The four are 苦, 聚 (or 集), 滅, and

<xa>道諦</xa>, i. e. duhkha 豆佉, samudaya 三牟提耶, nirodha 尼棲陀, and mārga 末加. Eitel interprets

them (1) 'that 'misery' is a necessary
attribute of sentient existence'; (2)

that 'the 'accumulation' of misery is
caused by the passions'; (3) that 'the

'extinction' of passion is possible; (4)
mārga is 'the doctrine of the 'path'

that leads to the extinction of passion'.
(1) 苦 suffering is
the lot of the 六趣

six states of existence; (2) 集 is the
aggregation (or exacerbation) of suffering

by reason of the passions; (3) 滅 is nirvana,
the extinction of desire and its
<pb n="29"/>

consequences, and the leaving of the
sufferings of mortality as void and

extinct; (4) 道 is the way of such extinction, i.
e. the 八正道 eightfold correct

way. The first two are considered to be
related to this life, the last two to

<xa>出世間</xa>a life outside or apart from the world. The four are described as
the

fundamental doctrines first preached to his
five former ascetic companions.

Those who accepted these truths were in the
stage of śrāvaka. There is much

dispute as to the meaning of 滅 'extinction'
as to whether it means extinction of

suffering, of passion, or of existence. The
Nirvana Sutra 18 says that whoever

accepts the four dogmas will put an end to
births and deaths 若能見四諦則得斷生死 which

does not of necessity mean the termination
of existence but that of continued
<pb n="30"/>

transmigration. v. 滅.

proof and knowledge of the truth; and (4) 勝進道 surpassing

earth-prison; 冥府 the shades, or

it may also be termed purgatory; one of the
six gati or ways of transmigration.

The hells are divided into three classes:
I. Central, or radical, 根本地獄

consisting of (1) The eight hot hells.
These were the original hells of

primitive Buddhism, and are supposed to be
located umder the southern continent

Jambudvīpa 瞻部州, 500 yojanas below the surface.
(a) 等活 or 更活 Samjīva,
rebirth,

where after many kinds of suffering a cold
wind blows over the soul and returns

it to this life as it was before, hence the
name 等活. (b) 黑繩 Kaslasūtra,
where

the sufferer is bound with black chains and
chopped or sawn asunder. (c) 線合; 衆合;
<pb n="170"/>

<xa>堆壓</xa>Samghāta, where are multitudes of implements of torture, or the falling

(h) 無間; 河鼻旨; 阿惟越致;

<xa>阿毗至;</xa>阿鼻; 阿毗 Avīci, unintermitted suffering, where sinners die and are reborn to


suffer without interval. (2) The eight cold
hells 八寒地獄. (a) 頞浮陀地獄 Arbuda, where

the cold causes blisters. (b) 尼刺部陀
Nirarbuda, colder still causing the blisters

to burst. (c) 頞哳吒; 阿吒吒 Atata,
where this is the only possible sound from frozen

lips. (d) 臛臛婆; 阿波波 Hahava or Apapa, where it is so
cold that only this sound can

<pb n="171"/>

(f) 嗢鉢羅; 鬱鉢羅 (or 優鉢羅) Utpala, or 尼羅鳥 (or 漚) 鉢羅 Nīlotpala, where the skin is

frozen like blue lotus buds. (g) 鉢特摩 Padma,
where the skin is frozen and bursts

open like red lotus buds. (h) 摩訶鉢特摩
Mahāpadma, ditto like great red lotus buds.

Somewhat different names are also given.
Cf. 倶舍論 8; 智度論 16; 涅槃經 11. II.
The

secondary hells are called 近邊地獄 adjacent
hells or 十六遊增 each of its four sides,

opening from each such door are four
adjacent hells, in all sixteen; thus with

the original eight there are 136. A list of
eighteen hells is given in the

<xa>十八泥梨經</xa>. III. A third class is called the 孤地獄 (獨地獄) Lokāntarika, or isolated hells

in mountains, deserts, below the earth and
above it. Eitel says in regard to the

eight hot hells that they range 'one
beneath the other in tiers which begin at a

<pb n="172"/>
depth of 11,900 yojanas and reach to a
depth of 40,000 yojanas'. The cold hells

are under 'the two Tchahavālas and range
shaft-like one below the other, but so

that this shaft is gradually widening to
the fourth hell and then narrowing

itself again so that the first and last
hell have the shortest, those in the

centre the longest diameter'. 'Every
universe has the same number of hells, '

but 'the northern continent has no hell
whatever, the two continents east and

west of Meru have only small Lokāntarika
hells… whilst all the other hells are

required for the inhabitants of the southern
continent '. It may be noted that

the purpose of these hells is definitely
punitive, as well as purgatorial. Yama

is the judge and ruler, assisted by
eighteen officers and a host of demons, who

<pb n="173"/>
order or administer the various degrees of
torture. 'His sister performs the

same duties with regard to female
criminals, ' and it may be mentioned that the

Chinese have added the 血盆池 Lake of
the bloody bath, or 'placenta tank' for women

who die in childbirth. Release from the
hells is in the power of the monks by

tantric means.

<xa>地藏</xa>Ti-tsang, J. Jizō, Ksitigarbha, 乞叉底蘗沙;
Earth-store, Earth-treasury, or

Earthwomb. One of the group of eight
Dhvani- Bodhisattvas. With hints of a

feminine origin, he is now the guardian of
the earth. Though associated with

Yama as overlord, and with the dead and the
hells, his role is that of saviour.

Depicted with the alarum staff with its six
rings, he is accredited with power

over the hells and is devoted to the saving
of all creatures between the nirvana

of Śākyamuni and the advent of Maitreya the
<pb n="175"/>
fifth century he has been especially

considered as the deliverer from the hells.
His central place in China is at

Chiu-hua-shan, forty li south-west of
Ch'ing-yang in Anhui. In Japan he is also

the protector of travellers by land and his
image accordingly appears on the

roads; bereaved parents put stones by his
images to seek his aid in relieving

the labours of their dead in the task of
piling stones on the banks of the

Buddhist Styx; he also helps women in
labour. He is described as holding a place

between the gods and men on the one hand
and the hells on the other for saving

all in distress; some say he is an
incarnation of Yama. At dawn he sits immobile

on the earth 地 and meditates on the myriads of
its beings 藏. When represented as

a monk, it may be through the influence of
<pb n="176"/>
a Korean monk who is considered to be

his incarnation, and who came to China in
653 and died in 728 at the age of 99

after residing at Chiu-hua-shan for
seventy-five years: his body, not decaying,

is said to have been gilded over and became
an object of worship. Many have

confused 眞羅 part of Korea with 暹羅 Siam. There
are other developments of

Ti-tsang, such as the 六地藏 Six
Ti-tsang, i. e. severally converting or

transforming those in the hells, pretas,
animals, asuras, men, and the devas;

these six Ti-tsang have different images and
symbols. Ti-tsang has also six

messengers 六使者: Yama for transforming those in
hell; the pearl-holder for

pretas; the strong one or animals; the
devīof mercy for asuras; the devī of the

treasure for human beings; one who has
<pb n="177"/>
charge of the heavens for the devas.

There is also the 延命地藏 Yanming
Ti-tsang, who controls length of days and who is

approached, as also may be P'u-hsien, for
that Purpose; his two assistants are

the Supervisors of good and evil 掌善 and 掌惡. Under
another form, as 勝軍地藏 Ti-tsang

is chiefly associated with the esoteric
cult. The benefits derived from his

worship are many, some say ten, others say
twenty-eight. His vows are contained

in the 地藏菩薩本願經. There is also the 大乘大集地藏十電經 tr.
by Xuanzang in 10 juan in the

seventh century, which probably influenced
the spread of the Ti-tsang cult.

<xa>佛</xa>Buddha, from budh to "be aware of", "conceive",
"observe", "wake"; also 佛陀;

<xa>浮圖;</xa>浮陀; 浮頭; 浮塔; 勃陀; 勃馱; 沒馱; 母馱; 母陀; 部陀; 休屠. Buddha means "completely conscious,

enlightened", and came to mean the
enlightener. he Chinese translation is 覺 to

perceive, aware, awake; and 智 gnosis,
knowledge. There is an Eternal Buddha, see

e.g. the Lotus Sutra, cap. 16, and
multitudes of Buddhas, but the personality of

a Supreme Buddha, an Ādi-Buddha, is not
defined. Buddha is in and through all

things, and some schools are definitely
Pan-Buddhist in the pantheistic sense.

In the triratna 三寳 commonly
known as 三寳佛, while Śākyamuni Buddha is the first

"person" of the Trinity, his Law
the second, and the Order the third, all three

by some are accounted as manifestations of
the All-Buddha. As Śākyamuni, the
<pb n="274"/>

title indicates him as the last of the line
of Buddhas who have appeared in this

world, Maitreya is to be the next. As such
he is the one who has achieved

enlightenment, having discovered the
essential evil of existence (some say

mundane existence, others all existence),
and the way of deliverance from the

constant round of reincarnations; this way
is through the moral life into

nirvana, by means of self-abnegation, the
monastic life, and meditation. By this

method a Buddha, or enlightened one,
himself obtains Supreme Enlightenment, or

Omniscience, and according to Māhāyanism
leads all beings into the same

enlightenment. He sees things not as they
seem in their phenomenal but in their

noumenal aspects, as they really are. The
term is also applied to those who
<pb n="275"/>

understand the chain of causality (twelve
nidānas) and have attained

enlightenment surpassing that of the arhat.
Four types of the Buddha are

referred to: (1) 三藏佛the Buddha
of the Tripitaka who attained enlightenment on

the bare ground under the bodhi-tree; (2) 通佛the Buddha
on the deva robe under

the bodhi-tree of the seven precious
things; (3) 別佛the Buddha on the great

precious Lotus throne under the Lotus realm
bodhi-tree; and (4) 圓佛the Buddha on

the throne of Space in the realm of eternal
rest and glory where he is

Vairocana. The Hīnayāna only admits the
existence of one Buddha at a time;

Mahāyāna claims the existence of many
Buddhas at one and the same time, as many

Buddhas as there are Buddha-universes,
which are infinite in number.

the kalpas of formation, existence,

as a complete period are called

mahākalpa 大劫. Each great kalpa is subdivided
into four asankhyeya-kalpas (阿僧企耶

i.e. numberless, incalculable): (1) kalpa
of destruction samvarta; (2)kalpa of

utter annihilation, or empty kalpa 増滅劫; 空劫 samvarta-siddha;

four cakravartīs in succession, i.e.

the four ages of iron, copper, silver,
gold, during which the length of human

life increases by one year every century to
84,000 years, and the length of the

human body to 8,400 feet. Then comes the
kalpa of decrease divided into periods

of the three woes, pestilence, war, famine,
during which the length of human

life is gradually reduced to ten years and
<pb n="313"/>
the human body to 1 foot in height.

There are other distinctions of the kalpas.
A small kalpa is represented as

16,800,000 years, a kalpa as 336,000,000
years, and a mahākalpa as 1,334,000,000

years. There are many ways of illustrating
the length of a kalpa, e.g. pass a

soft cloth over a solid rock 40 li in size
once in a hundred years, when finally

the rock has been thus worn away a kalpa
will not yet have passed; or a city of

40 li, filled with mustard seeds, one being
removed every century till all have

gone, a kalpa will not yet have passed. Cf.

is not a true Bodhisattva, v. 我人四相.

the concept of the reality of the ego, man being

composed of elements and disintegrated when

<xa>宗派</xa>Sects (of Buddhism). In India, according to Chinese accounts, the
two schools

of Hīnayāna became divided into twenty
sects. Mahāyāna had two main schools, the

Āryadeva about the second century A. D.,

and the Yogācārya, ascribed to Asavga
<pb n="447"/>
and Vasubandhu in the fourth century A. D.

In China thirteen sects were founded: (1) 倶舍宗 Abhidharma
or Kośa sect,

representing Hīnayāna, based upon the
Abhidharma-kosa-śāstra or 倶舍論. (2) 成實宗

Satyasiddhi sect, based on the 成實論
Satyasiddhi-śāstra, tr. by Kumārajīva; no

sect corresponds to it in India; in China
and Japan it became incorporated in

the 三論宗. (3) 律宗 Vinaya or Discipline sect, based on 十誦律, 四分律, 僧祗律, etc. (4) 三論宗

The three śāstra sect, based on the
Mādhyamika-śāstra 中觀論 of Nāgārjuna, the

Sata-śāstra 百論 of Āryadeva, and the
Dvādasa-nikāya-śāstra 十二門論 of Nāgārjuna;

this school dates back to the translation
of the three śāstras by Kumārajīva in

A. D. 409. (5) 涅槃宗 Nirvāna

Dharmaraksa in 423; later incorporated in

common. (6) 地論宗 Daśabhūmikā sect, based on

tr. by Bodhiruci 508, absorbed by the

by Bodhiruci; its doctrine was salvation
through faith in Amitābha into the

Western Paradise. (8) 禪宗 dhyāna,
meditative or intuitional sect, attributed to

Bodhidharma about A. D. 527, but it existed
before he came to China. (9) 攝論宗,

based upon the 攝大乘論
Mahāyāna-samparigraha-śāstra by Asavga, tr. by Paramārtha in

563, subsequently absorbed by the Avatamsaka
sect. (10) 天台宗 Tiantai, based on

the 法華經 Saddharmapundarīka Sūtra, or the Lotus of the Good Law; it is a

consummation of the Mādhyamika tradition.
(11) 華嚴宗 Avatamsaka
sect, based on the
<pb n="449"/>

Buddhāvatamsaka-sūtra, or
Gandha-vyūha 華嚴經 tr. in 418. (12) 法相宗 Dharmalaksana

sect, established after the return of
Xuanzang from India and his trans. of the

important Yogācārya works. (13) 眞言宗 Mantra

sects are named: Sanron, Hossō, Kegon,
Kusha, Jōjitsu, Ritsu, Tendai, Shingon;

these are known as the ancient sects, the
two last being styled mediaeval; there

follow the Zen and Jōdo; the remaining two

above the 初地, or, according to

Tiantai, above the 初住.

<xa>法身藏</xa>The storehouse of the dharmakāya, the essence of Buddhahood, by

<pb n="537"/>
it.

<xa>法身觀</xa>Meditation on, or insight into, the dharmakāya, varying in
definition in the

various schools.

<xa>法身體性</xa>The embodiment, totality, or nature of the dharmakāya. In Hīnayāna
the

Buddha-nature in its 理 or absolute
side is described as not discussed, being

synonymous with the 五分 five
divisions of the commandments, meditation, wisdom,

release, and doctrine, 戒, 定, 慧, 解脫, and 知見. In the
Mahāyāna the 三論宗 defines the

absolute or ultimate reality as the
formless which contains all forms, the

essence of being, the noumenon of the other
two manifestations of the triratna.

The 法相宗 defines it as (a) the nature or essence of the whole triratna; (b)
the

particular form of the Dharma in that
trinity. The One-Vehicle schools
<pb n="538"/>

represented by the 華嚴宗, 天台, etc.,
consider it to be the bhūtatathatā, 理 and 智

being one and undivided. The Shingon sect
takes the six elements-earth, water,

fire, air, space, mind-as the 理 or
fundamental dharmakāya and the sixth, mind,

intelligence, or knowledge, as the 智 Wisdom
dharmakāya.

<xa>法輪</xa>dharmacakra, the Wheel of the Law, Buddha-truth which is able to
crush all

evil and all opposition, like Indra's

enlightenment. A method. Any sect. As the

Buddha provides 84,000 methods法門of dealing
with them. Hence the法門海 ocean of

Buddha's methods.

<xa>法門身</xa>A Tiantai definition of the dharmakāya of the Trinity, i.e. the

"hanging down,"
"depending," "support"; it is intp. "to hang upside
down", or

"to be in suspense", referring to
extreme suffering in purgatory; but there is a

suggestion of the dependence of the dead on
the living. By some 盆 is regarded as

a Chinese word, not part of the
transliteration, meaning a vessel filled with

offerings of food. The term is applied to
the festival of All Souls, held about

the 15th of the 7th moon, when masses are
read by Buddhist and Taoist priests

and elaborate offerings made to the Buddhist
Trinity for the purpose of

releasing from purgatory the souls of those
who have died on land or sea. The
<pb n="545"/>

Ullambanapātra Sutra is attributed to
Śākyamuni, of course incorrectly; it was

first tr. into Chinese by Dharmaraksha,
A.D. 266-313 or 317; the first masses

are not reported until the time of Liang
Wudi, A.D. 538; and were popularized by

Amogha (A.D. 732) under the influence of
the Yogācārya School. They are

generally observed in China, but are
unknown to Southern Buddhism. The "idea of

intercession on the part of the priesthood
for the benefit of" souls in hell "is

utterly antagonistic to the explicit
teaching of primitive Buddhism'" The origin

of the custom is unknown, but it is foisted
on to Śākyamuni, whose disciple

Maudgalyāyana is represented as having been
to purgatory to relieve his mother's

sufferings. Śākyamuni told him that only
the united efforts of the whole
<pb n="546"/>

priesthood 十方衆會 could alleviate the pains of
the suffering. The mere suggestion

of an All Souls Day with a great national
day for the monks is sufficient to

account for the spread of the festival.
Eitel says: "Engrafted upon the

narrative ancestral worship, this
ceremonial for feeding the ghost of deceased

ancestors of seven generations obtained
immense popularity and is now practised

by everybody in China, by Taoists even and
by Confucianists." All kinds of food

offerings are made and paper garments,
etc., burnt. The occasion, 7th moon, 15th

day, is known as the盂蘭會 (or 盂蘭盆會 or 盂蘭齋 or 盂蘭盆齋) and the
sutra as 盂蘭經 (or 盂蘭盆經).

immateriality, perhaps spirituality,

unreality, the false or illusory nature of
all existence, the seeming 假 being

unreal. The doctrine that all phenomena and
the ego have no reality, but are

composed of a certain number of skandhas or
elements, which disintegrate. The

void, the sky, space. The universal, the
absolute, complete abstraction without

relativity. There are classifications into
2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 11, 13, 16, and 18

categories. The doctrine is that all things
are compounds, or unstable

organisms, possessing no self-essence, i.e.
are dependent, or caused, come into

existence only to perish. The underlying
reality, the principle of eternal

relativity, or non-infinity, i.e. śūnya,
<pb n="553"/>
permeates all phenomena making possible

their evolution. From this doctrine the

permanent; 中 the "middle" doctrine of the

Madhyamaka School, which denies both
positions in the interests of the

transcendental, or absolute. 空以破一切法, 假以立一切法, 中以妙一切法 other 卽 空卽假卽中. śūnya

(universality) annihilates all relativities,
particularity establishes all

relativities, the middle path transcends
and unites all relativities. Tiantai

them and calls them a unity, the one

including the other 即空即假即中.

<xa>空有二宗</xa>The two schools 空and 有 in Hīnayāna are given as 倶舍 Kośa for 有 in 成實

groups or circles, representing in various

two, fundamental concepts. vajradhātu is
intp. as the 智 realm of intellection,

and garbhadhātu as the 理 substance
underlying it, or the matrix; the latter is

the womb or fundamental reason of all
things, and occupies the eastern position

as 'cause' of the vajradhātu, which is on
the west as the resultant intellectual

or spiritual expression. But both are one

supply. The vajradhātu represents the
spiritual world of complete enlightenment,

doctrine. It is the sixth element 識 mind, and is
symbolized by a triangle with

the point downwards and by the full moon, which

understanding; it corresponds to 果 fruit, or
effect, garbhadhātu being 因 or

cause. The 金剛王五部 or five divisions of the

<xa>阿彌陀</xa>(阿彌) amita, boundless, infinite; tr. by 無量 immeasurable. The Buddha of

infinite qualities, known as 阿彌陀婆 (or 阿彌陀佛)
Amitābha, tr. 無量光 boundless light;

<xa>阿彌陀廋斯</xa>Amitāyus, tr. 無量壽　boundless age, or life; and among the esoteric sects

Amrta 甘露 (甘露王) sweet-dew (king). An imaginary
being unknown to ancient Buddhism,

possibly of Persian or Iranian origin, who
has eclipsed the historical Buddha in

<pb n="609"/>
becoming the most popular divinity in the
Mahāyāna pantheon. His name indicates

an idealization rather than an historic
personality, the idea of eternal light

and life. The origin and date of the
concept are unknown, but he has always been

associated with the west, where in his
Paradise, Suikhāvatī, the Western Pure

Land, he receives to unbounded happiness
all who call upon his name (cf. the

Pure Lands 淨土 of Maitreya and Aksobhya).
This is consequent on his forty-eight

vows, especially the eighteenth, in which
he vows to refuse Buddhahood until he

has saved all living beings to his
Paradise, except those who had committed the

five unpardonable sins, or were guilty of
blasphemy against the Faith. While his

Paradise is theoretically only a stage on
the way to rebirth in the final joys

<pb n="610"/>
of nirvana, it is popularly considered as
the final resting-place of those who

cry na-mo a-mi-to-fo, or blessed be, or
adoration to, Amita Buddha. The 淨土

Pure-land (Jap. Jōdo) sect is especially
devoted to this cult, which arises

chiefly out of the Sukhāvatīvyūha, but
Amita is referred to in many other texts

and recognized, with differing
interpretations and emphasis, by the other sects.

Eitel attributes the first preaching of the
dogma to 'a priest from Tokhara' in

A. D.147, and says that Faxian and Xuanzang
make no mention of the cult. But the

Chinese pilgrim 慧日Huiri says
he found it prevalent in India 702-719. The first

translation of the Amitāyus Sutra, circa
A.D. 223-253, had disappeared when the

Kaiyuan catalogue was compiled A.D. 730.
The eighteenth vow occurs in the tr. by

<pb n="611"/>
Dharmaraksa A.D. 308.
With Amita is closely associated Avalokiteśvara, who is

also considered as his incarnation, and
appears crowned with, or bearing the

image of Amita. In the trinity of Amita,
Avalokiteśvara appears on his left and

Mahāsthāmaprāpta on his right. Another
group, of five, includes Ksitigarbha and

Nāgārjuna, the latter counted as the second
patriarch of the Pure Land sect. One

who calls on the name of Amitābha is styled
<xa>阿彌陀聖</xa>a saint
of Amitābha. Amitābha

is one of the Five 'dhyāni buddhas' 五佛, q.v. He
has many titles, amongst which

are the following twelve relating to him as
Buddha of light, also his title of

eternal life: 無量光佛Buddha of
boundless light; 無邊光佛 Buddha of unlimited light;

<xa>無礙光佛</xa>Buddha of irresistible light; 無對光佛 Buddha of incomparable light; 燄王光佛

<pb n="612"/>
Buddha of yama or flame-king light; 淸淨光佛 Buddha of
pure light; 歡喜光佛 Buddha of

joyous light; 智慧光佛 Buddha of
wisdom light; 不斷光佛 Buddha of unending light; 難思光佛

Buddha of inconceivable light; 無稱光佛Buddha of
indescribable light; 超日月光佛 Buddha

of light surpassing that of sun and moon; 無量壽 Buddha of
boundless age. As buddha

he has, of course, all the attributes of a
buddha, including the trikāya, or

<xa>法報化身</xa>, about which in re Amita there are differences of opinion in the
various

schools. His esoteric germ-letter is hrīh,
and he has specific manual-signs. Cf.

<xa>阿彌陀經</xa>, of which with commentaries there are numerous editions.

intellectuality represented in the

vajradhātu; hence it is the 因 cause and
vajradhātu the 果 effect; though as both

are a unity, the reverse may be the rule,
the effect being also the cause; it is

also likened to 利他 enriching
others, as vajradhātu is to 自利 enriching self. Kōbō

Daishi, founder of the Yoga or Shingon 眞言 School in
Japan, adopted the

representation of the ideas in mandalas,
or diagrams, as the best way of
<pb n="756"/>

revealing the mystic doctrine to the
ignorant. The garbhadhātu is the womb or

treasury of all things, the universe; the 理 fundamental
principle, the source;

its symbols are a triangle on its base, and
an open lotus as representing the

sun and Vairocana. In Japan this mandala
is placed on the east, typifying the

rising sun as source, or 理. The
vajradhātu is placed west and represents 智

wisdom or knowledge as derived from 理 the
underlying principle, but the two are

essential one to the other, neither
existing apart. The material and spiritual;

wisdom-source and intelligence; essence and
substance; and similar complementary

ideas are thus portrayed; the garbhadhātu
may be generally considered as the

static and the vajradhātu as the dynamic
categories, which are nevertheless a
<pb n="757"/>

unity. The garbhadhātu is divided into 三部 three
sections representing samādhi or

quiescence, wisdom-store, and pity-store,
or thought, knowledge, pity; one is

called the Buddha-section, the others the
Vajra and Lotus sections respectively;

the three also typify vimoksa,
prajñā, and dharmakāya, or freedom,

understanding, and spirituality. There are
three heads of these sections, i. e.

Vairocana, Vajrapāni, and
Avalokiteśvara; each has a mother or source, e. g.

Vairocana from Buddha's-eye; and each has a
<xa>明王</xa>or
emanation of protection

against evil; also a śakti or female
energy; a germ-letter, etc. The diagram of

five Buddhas contains also four
bodhisattvas, making nine in all, and there are

altogether thirteen 大院 or great
<pb n="758"/>
courts of various types of ideas, of varying

numbers, generally spoken of as 414. Cf. 金剛界; 大日; 兩部.

<xa>涅槃</xa>nirvāna, 'blown out, gone out, put out, extinguished'; 'liberated-from

existence'; 'dead, deceased, defunct.'
'Liberation, eternal bliss'; '(with Buddhists and Jainas) absolute extinction
or annihilation, complete extinction of individual existence.' M.W. Other forms
are 涅槃那; 泥日; 泥洹; 泥畔 Originally
translated 滅 to extinguish, extinction, put out (as a lamp or fire), it was also
described as 解脫 release, 寂滅 tranquil extinction; 無爲 inaction, without effort, passiveness; 不生 no
(re)birth; 安樂 calm joy; 滅度transmigration to 'extinction'. The meaning given to 'extinction'
varies, e.g. individual extinction; cessation of rebirth; annihilation of
passion; extinction of all misery and entry into bliss. While the meaning of
individual extinction is not without advocates, the general acceptation is the
extinction or end of all return to reincarnation with its concomitant
suffering, and the entry into bliss. Nirvāna may be
enjoyed in the present life as an attainable state, with entry into parinirvāna,
or perfect bliss to follow. It may be (a) with a 'remainder', i.e. the cause
but not all the effect (karma), of reincarnation having been destroyed; (b)
without 'remainder', both cause and effect having been extinguished. The answer
of the Buddha as to the continued personal existence of the Tathāgata in nirvāna
is, in the Hīnayāna canon, relegated 'to the sphere of the indeterminates'
(Keith), as one of the questions which are not essential to salvation. One
argument is that flame when blown out does not perish but returns to the
totality of Fire. The Nirvāna Sutra claims for nirvāna the ancient ideas of 常樂我淨
<pb n="847"/>
permanence, bliss, personality purity in the transcendental realm. Mahāyāna
declares that Hīnayāna by denying personality in the transcendental realm denies
the existence of the Buddha. In Mahāyāna final nirvāna is
transcendental, and is also used as a term for the absolute. The place where
the Buddha entered his earthly nirvāna is given as Kuśinagara, cf. 拘.

Pūrna, or Kāśyapa;

indeed the characteristic feature of the
Mahāyāna.' Keith. According to Mahāyāna

<pb n="198"/>
the Hinayanists, i.e. the śrāvaka and

while the bodhisattva's aim is the
salvation of others and of all. The earlier

intp. of bodhisattva was 大道心衆生 all
beings with mind for the truth; later it

became 大覺有情 conscious beings of or for the
great intelligence, or enlightenment.

It is also intp. in terms of leadership,
heroism, etc. In general it is a

it altruistically; whether monk or

layman, he seeks enlightenment to enlighten
others, and he will sacrifice

himself to save others; he is devoid of
egoism and devoted to helping others.

require to undergo development. The
mahāsattva is sufficiently advanced to

<pb n="199"/>
become a Buddha and enter nirvāna,

realm of incarnation to save all conscious
beings. A monk should enter on the

arduous course of discipline which leads to
Bodhisattvahood and Buddhahood.

<pb n="246"/>

reality or Buddhahood at once.

<xa>圓成實性</xa>The perfect true nature, absolute reality, the bhūtatathatā.

<xa>圓戒</xa>v. 圓頓戒.

<xa>圓教</xa>The complete, perfect, or comprehensive doctrine; the school or
sect of

Mahāyāna which represents it. The term has
had three references. The first was

by 光統 Guangtong of the Later Wei, sixth century, who defined three
schools, 漸

gradual, 頓 immediate, and 圓 inclusive or
complete. The Tiantai called its fourth

section the inclusive, complete, or perfect
<pb n="247"/>
teaching 圓, the other three being 三藏

Hīnayāna, 通 Mahāyāna-cum-Hīnayāna, 別 Mahāyāna.
The Huayan so called its fifth

section, i.e. 小乘; 大乘始; 大乘終; 頓 and 圓. It is the
Tiantai version that is in

general acceptance, defined as a perfect
whole and as complete in its parts; for

the whole is the absolute and its parts are
therefore the absolute; the two may

be called noumenon and phenomenon, or 空 and 假 (or 俗), but in
reality they are

one, i.e. the 中 medial
condition. To conceive these three as a whole is the

Tiantai inclusive or 'perfect' doctrine.
The Huayan 'perfect' doctrine also

taught that unity and differentiation, or
absolute and relative, were one, a

similar doctrine to that of the identity of
contraries. In Tiantai teaching the

harmony is due to its underlying unity; its
<pb n="248"/>
completeness to the permeation of

this unity in all phenomena; these two are
united in the medial 中 principle; to

comprehend these three principles at one
and the same time is the complete,

all-containing, or 'perfect' doctrine of
Tiantai. There are other definitions of

the all-inclusive doctrine, e.g. the eight
complete things, complete in

teaching, principles, knowledge, etc. 圓教四門 v. 四門.

<xa>圓斷</xa>The Tiantai doctrine of the complete cutting off, at one remove, of

part contains the whole, the absolute in
the relative.

<xa>圓滿經</xa>The complete, or all-inclusive sūtra, a term applied to the Huayan
jing.

<xa>圓空</xa>Complete vacuity, i.e. 空空, from which even the idea of vacuity is absent.

<xa>圓融</xa>Complete combination; the absolute in the relative and vice versa;
the

identity of apparent contraries; perfect
harmony among all differences, as in

water and waves, passion and enlightenment,
transmigration and nirvāna, or life

and death, etc.; all are of the same
fundamental nature, all are bhūtatathatā,

and bhūtatathatā is all; waves are one with
waves, and water is one with water,

and water and wave are one.

<xa>圓融三諦</xa>The three dogmas of 空假中 as combined, as one and the same, as a unity,
<pb n="250"/>

according to the Tiantai inclusive or
perfect school. The universal 空 apart from

the particular 假 is an
abstraction. The particular apart from the universal is

unreal. The universal realizes its true
nature in the particular, and the

particular derives its meaning from the
universal. The middle path 中 unites

these two aspects of one reality.

<xa>圓行</xa>The conduct or discipline of the Tiantai 'perfect' school.

<xa>圓覺</xa>Complete enlightenment potentially present in each being, for all
have 本覺

<xa>緣覺</xa>pratyekabuddha 辟支佛; 辟支迦佛; 鉢剌翳伽陀 (鉢剌翳伽佛陀) In the early translations it was

reasoning on the riddle of life,

especially as defined in the twelve
nidānas. Later it was rendered 獨覺 or

individual enlightenment, i.e. one who
lives apart from others and attains

enlightenment alone, or for himself, in
contrast with the altruism of the

bodhisattva principle. The term
pratyekabuddha is not limited to Buddhists, but

is also general for recluses pondering
alone over the meaning of life, an

illustration being the rhinoceros, which
lives in isolation. The non-Buddhist

enlightenment is illusion, e.g. from
observing the 'flying flowers and falling

leaves'; the Buddhist enlightenment arises
from pondering over the twelve

nidānas. As a degree of saintship it is
undefined by early Buddhism, receiving

its definition at a later period.

the object
<pb n="487"/>

and subject.

<xa>緣起</xa>Arising from conditional causation; everything arises from
conditions, and

not being spontaneous and self-contained
has no separate and independent nature;

cf. 緣生. It is a fundamental doctrine of the Huayan school, which defines
four

principal uses of the term: (1) 業感緣起 that of
the Hīnayāna, i.e. under the

influence of karma the conditions of
reincarnation arise; (2) 賴耶緣起 that of the

primitive Mahāyāna school, i.e. that all
things arise from the ālaya, or 藏

fundamental store; (3) 如來藏緣起 that of
the advancing Mahāyāna, that all things

arise from the tathāgatagarbha, or
bhūtatathatā; (4) 法界緣起 that of complete

Mahāyāna, in which one is all and all are
one, each being a universal cause.

<pb n="488"/>

traced to the awakening of Huiyuan by the
reading of the Prajñāpāramitā sūtra.

the six mentioned below produces

cosmic evolution. It chiefly occupied
itself, like the orthodox Nyāya

six categories of cognition 六諦, viz.
substance, quality, activity, species,

dhyāna, and the remaining nine the fourth

Childers' Pali Dictionary, 'The four jhānas
are four stages of mystic

meditation, whereby the believer's mind is
purged from all earthly emotions, and

detached as it were from his body, which
remains plunged in a profound trance.'

Seated cross-legged, the practiser
'concentrates his mind upon a single thought.

Gradually his soul becomes filled with a
supernatural ecstasy and serenity', his

mind still reasoning: this is the first
jhāna. Concentrating his mind on the

established in China by Bodhidharma, v. 達, the

This sect, believing in direct
enlightenment, disregarded ritual and sūtras and

depended upon the inner light and personal
influence for the propagation of its

tenets, founding itself on the esoteric
tradition supposed to have been imparted

to Kāśyapa by the Buddha, who indicated his
meaning by plucking a flower without

further explanation. Kāśyapa smiled in
apprehension and is supposed to have

passed on this mystic method to the
patriarchs. The successor of Bodhidharma was

<xa>慧可</xa>Huike, and he was succeeded by 僧璨 Sengcan; 道信 Daoxin; 弘忍 Hongren; 慧能 Huineng,

8th day of the 4th month; next year on the

seven days later, leaving him to be brought
up by her sister Prājapati; that in

due course he was married to Yaśodharā who
bore him a son, Rāhula; that in

search of truth he left home, became an
ascetic, severely disciplined himself,

and finally at 35 years of age, under a
tree, realized that the way of release

from the chain of rebirth and death lay not
in asceticism but in moral purity;

this he explained first in his four dogmas,
v. 四諦 and
eightfold noble way 八正道,

later amplified and developed in many
sermons. He founded his community on the

<pb n="721"/>
basis of poverty, chastity, and insight or
meditation, ad it became known as

Buddhism, as he became known as Buddha, the
enlightened. His death was probably

in or near 487 B.C., a few years before

meaning of the term is in doubt; it is

intp. as above, but the term 觀自在 (觀世自在) accords
with the idea of Sovereign

Regarder and is not associated with sounds
or cries. Guanyin is one of the triad

of Amida, is represented on his left, and
is also represented as crowned with

Amida; but there are as many as
thirty-three different forms of Guanyin,

hands, etc., and, when as bestower of

provenance and the date of its introduction to China are still in doubt.
Chapter 25 of the Lotus Sūtra is devoted to Guanyin, and is the principal
scripture of the cult; its date is uncertain. Guanyin is sometimes confounded
with Amitābha and Maitreya. She is said to be the daughter of king Śubhavyūha 妙莊王, who had
her killed by 'stifling because the sword of the executioner broke without
hurting her. Her spirit went to hell; but hell changed into paradise. Yama sent
her back to life to save his hell, when she was miraculously transported on a
